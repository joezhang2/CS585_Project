"Sales in the March quarter exceeded our expectations. Demand in Europe and Asia was particularly strong during the quarter increasing 20% and 26% sequentially, respectively. The strength in Europe was broad-based, while the strength in Asia was driven by increased consumer transfer business from North American customers. International sales now represent a record 55% of total Xilinx revenue," said Wim Roelandts, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Earlier this week, Xilinx introduced the Spartan-3

FPGA family, which marks new milestones for the programmable logic industry. First, it is the only Programmable Logic Device (PLD) shipping on 90nm technology, which enables up to 80 percent chip-size reduction when compared to competing products on 130nm technology. This low cost family opens vast new business opportunities in high volume, high growth applications that have traditionally been served by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)."
 
Fiscal 2003 was a year of solid financial performance for Xilinx in spite of the sluggish overall economy and a weak technology sector. Revenues of $1.16 billion increased by 14% in fiscal 2003 as new Xilinx products experienced strong customer acceptance and diversified into new markets and applications. Cash and investments increased by $310 million to a record $1.1 billion. Finally, Xilinx exited the year with a fourth quarter operating margin of 20%, up from 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the highest in the PLD industry.

Xilinx's operating results improved significantly during the quarter.  Gross margin of 61% was better than expected and up from 60% in the prior quarter.   Firm expense controls resulted in operating margin improving to 22%, up from 18% in the prior quarter.  Similarly, net profit margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior quarter.  Both operating margin and profit margin were at their highest levels since the September quarter of CY2000.  "Much of this improvement has been driven by the shift to 300mm wafer production, which enables significant cost reductions.  In the September quarter, over 50% of our wafers were produced using 300mm wafers, up from approximately 40% in the prior quarter.  Our early and aggressive move to 300mm technology is not only paying off, but providing Xilinx with a significant competitive cost advantage," said Wim Roelandts, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Better than expected sales growth in the December quarter was driven by broad-based strength across all products, geographies and end markets.  "During the December quarter, Xilinx continued to benefit from solid customer adoption of new products as well as improving economic conditions, particularly in the communications sector," said Wim Roelandts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   Sales into the communications sector, which had been essentially flat in the prior three quarters, increased 20% sequentially due to strength in both telecom and networking applications.  Robust sales growth in Xilinx's mainstream and base products, which generally have higher margins, coupled with continued manufacturing improvements positively contributed to better operating metrics.  Gross margin improved for the fourth consecutive quarter to 62%, up from 59% in the same quarter a year ago.  Operating and profit margins of 23% and 19%, respectively, were at their highest levels in 13 quarters.
 
-II series, which includes Virtex-II and Virtex-II Pro FPGAs, topped $100 million in the December quarter, up over 80% versus the same quarter a year ago.  "This is a strong testament to the broad customer acceptance of this product family, which enables a wide variety of applications in areas such as broadband access, wireless and satellite communications, Voice over IP, video broadcast and high definition television," said Roelandts.

STIPULATION OF XILINX SETTLEMENT WITH INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE JOINTLY FILED
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced that it has reached a settlement with the IRS and that there will be no increase to Xilinx's taxable income relating to the license of technology on the formation of Xilinx Ireland.
SAN JOSE, CA, APRIL 7, 2004
 
In 1995 when Xilinx Ireland was formed, Xilinx Inc. licensed to Xilinx Ireland its existing technology. At that time, Xilinx commissioned an independent, third party study, as required by law, to calculate a royalty for the existing technology. The IRS in a later audit stated that the methodology used by Xilinx in calculating the royalty payment should have been handled differently. However, after an extensive review by way of the IRS Appeals process, the methodology used by Xilinx was accepted as having achieved the appropriate payment.
 
In response to assertions by the IRS in late 2000 that Xilinx owed additional tax, Xilinx established a reserve for the potential tax liability including interest and penalties. Since the IRS adjustment was not sustained, Xilinx is assessing the impact on previously established reserves including all interest and penalties accrued and will record an adjustment for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 to eliminate the liability. As a result, Xilinx tax rate for the entire fiscal FY04 period will be reduced.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual events and results, may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties including the completion our analysis and review by our independent auditors and other risk factors listed in our most recent Form 10K.

XILINX FIRST QUARTER FY05 REVENUES INCREASE 5% SEQUENTIALLY
 
SAN JOSE, CA, JULY 22, 2004
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced revenues of $424 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, a sequential increase of 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of 35% from the same quarter a year ago.  Net income was $95.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share including a $7.2 million pre-tax charge associated with the acquisition of Hier Design in June 2004.  Net income was down 27% from $130.9 million, or $0.36 in the prior quarter, which was positively impacted by a $34.4 million reduction in taxes associated with an IRS settlement and also included a $7.0 million pre-tax charge in connection with the acquisition of Triscend Corporation.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on September 1, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2004.

Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
Gross margin for the quarter increased for the sixth consecutive quarter to 66.0%, up from 64.7% in the prior quarter and up from 60.1% in the same quarter a year ago.  This was the highest gross margin the Company has reported in 15 years.  Better than expected yields and product mix contributed to the increase in gross margin.  Average selling prices remained firm.
 
"Sales from all geographies were up sequentially in the June quarter," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's chairman and chief executive officer.  "New products grew a healthy 10% sequentially and have nearly doubled versus the same quarter of the prior year.  Virtex-II Pro sales were the largest contributor to this sequential increase as design wins are beginning to turn to meaningful production volumes.  Additionally, sales from the Spartan-3 family, which is the industry's first FPGA manufactured using 90-nanometer (nm) process technology doubled sequentially during the quarter."
 
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services recently upgraded Xilinx's corporate credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the Company's leading market position in programmable logic, good cash flow generating capability, and an increasingly diversified base of customers and end markets.  Xilinx is the only PLD Company to have attained this rating.

XILINX REPORTS 53% INCREASE IN PROFITS; NEW PRODUCTS POST STRONG REVENUE GROWTH
 
SAN JOSE, CA, OCTOBER 21, 2004
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced revenues of $403 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, a sequential decrease of 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of 28% from the same quarter a year ago.  Net income was $86 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $56 million and $0.16 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on December 1, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2004.
 
Additional fiscal second quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below.
 
Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
European revenues, which are typically seasonally slow in the September quarter, were better than expected increasing 3% sequentially and 45% versus the same quarter a year ago. Much of this increase was driven by strength in the communications, industrial and automotive sectors.  However, sales to Asia Pacific were weak during the quarter, declining 15% sequentially. Much of this weakness was attributable to excess inventories at a few US-based customers with manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific and a slowdown within the China market for technology products.
 
"New product sales increased 44% sequentially and represented 17% of total Xilinx sales, up from 6% a year ago.  This is a strong testament to the customer acceptance and design win momentum of these products," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's chairman and chief executive officer.  "Virtex-II Pro FPGA sales increased nearly 70% sequentially as several customer design wins began moving into volume production.  CoolRunner-II CPLD sales nearly doubled sequentially.  Additionally, sales from the Spartan family of FPGAs increased to nearly 22% of total Xilinx revenues, up from 19% in the same quarter a year ago.  Most of this growth was driven by Spartan-IIe and Spartan-3 products, which are found in wide ranging applications such as digital television, media servers, automotive telematics and multi-function printers."

Xilinx continues to be the only PLD company in volume production at 90-nanometer technology.  Xilinx is currently shipping its Spartan-3 and Virtex-4 FPGAs on 90nm technology and has shipped over one million 90nm devices since its introduction of the Spartan-3 family in April, 2003.
 - 
                               
Xilinx recently announced a strategic foundry relationship with Toshiba.  Together, the companies have achieved a key manufacturing milestone with the successful production of functional 90nm silicon at Toshiba's state-of-the-art 300mm wafer fabrication facility at Oita, in Kyushu, Japan.
 - 
                               
 
Xilinx announced the creation of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Embedded Processing Divisions, demonstrating the importance of these two technologies in future PLD design. By focusing resources in these critical areas, Xilinx will be able to capitalize on an incremental market opportunity estimated by Gartner Dataquest to be approximately $7 billion.

XILINX BUSINESS UPDATE FOR DECEMBER QUARTER FISCAL 2005
 
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the December quarter of fiscal 2005.
SAN JOSE, CA, DECEMBER 8, 2004
 
Strong sales in the month of October were followed by weaker than expected turns bookings across all geographies in the month of November.   Although turns bookings have increased in the first week of the month of December, this strength is not expected to continue due to normal seasonality experienced during the holidays.  As a result, Xilinx is now expecting sales to decrease 5% to 8% sequentially in the December quarter.  This is down from prior guidance of down 2% to 6% sequentially.
 - 
                 
Gross margin target is expected to be approximately 64%, unchanged from prior guidance.
 - 
                 
As a result of lower revenue levels, inventory days at Xilinx and distribution are expected to be approximately 170 days, up from prior guidance of 156 days.
 -

XILINX ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005
 
SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 20, 2005
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced revenues of $355 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, a sequential decrease of 12% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago.  Net income was $64 million or $0.18 per diluted share including a $3.1 million charge relating to impairment losses on investments as well as a $5.5 million tax benefit associated primarily with a recent IRS settlement.  This compares to net income of $69 million and $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 2, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2005.
 
Additional fiscal third quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below.
 
Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
Excess inventory levels at end customers led to weaker than expected orders during the quarter, particularly in the telecom sector.  Sales from communications customers decreased 22% sequentially and represented 47% of total revenues, down from 53% last quarter.  All geographies declined sequentially.
 
"It was a challenging quarter for Xilinx and the PLD industry," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's Chairman and CEO.  "However, I remain encouraged by our solid new product execution which has enabled us to introduce an unprecedented number of devices during the last six months.  Additionally, as we exit 2004, I expect Xilinx to capture PLD market segment share for the seventh consecutive calendar year."

for their particular application.  This enables Xilinx to address key market segments such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and embedded processing that offer incremental market opportunity.  Xilinx is currently shipping 12 members of the Virtex-4 family.  The latest device to ship, the LX200, is the world's highest density device, with 30 percent more logic capacity than the closest competing FPGA. Virtex-4 FPGAs provide customers with key competitive advantages in every aspect of performance, up to 73% lower static power, and seven times better signal integrity
 
Since its introduction in 1998, Spartan FPGAs have driven Xilinx's success in diversified, high volume market segments such as consumer electronics and automotive telematics.  Sales from Spartan FPGAs increased 24% in fiscal 2005 versus the prior fiscal year and represented 22% of total revenues at the end of the fiscal year, up from 5% five years ago.   Sales from the newest Spartan family, Spartan-3, increased more than 50% in the most recent quarter, generating more in sales than any other 90nm PLD product in the industry. During the year we complemented this successful family with the introduction of the Spartan-3E family, which delivers more logic per dollar than any other programmable device, and the Spartan-3L family, which is optimized for low power applications.
 - 
                 
 
Xilinx CPLD sales grew faster in fiscal 2005 than any other supplier, driving solid market share gains and making Xilinx the second largest supplier of CPLDs for the first time in company history.  Xilinx estimates its share of the CPLD market segment to be approximately 26%, up from 22% last year and up from 11% five years ago.
 - 
                 
 
During the year, Xilinx introduced v7.1i of ISE to its growing user base of more than 200,000 designers.  Besides averaging a 15% logic performance advantage over its nearest competitor, ISE integrates with the System Generator for DSP, the Embedded Developers Kit for embedded processing design ChipScope Pro for real time in-silicon verification. With 15,000 new users a quarter, ISE continues to grow in popularity as evidenced by Xilinx being rated #1 FPGA EDA tool vendor in a survey conducted by a leading electronics engineering publication, winning in all major categories.
 - 
                 
 
During the year, Xilinx announced the creation of the DSP and Embedded Processing Solutions Divisions.  Both of these divisions combine the Company's domain expertise and comprehensive offering of systems solutions with its leading-edge portfolio of intellectual property cores and development tools. The new organizational structure reinforces Xilinx's commitment to the increasingly diverse, changing needs of FPGA designers throughout the world.
 - 
                 
 
A solid cash position coupled with consistently high cash flow generation enabled Xilinx to launch the PLD industry's first dividend program in the June quarter of fiscal 2005.   Xilinx recently raised its quarterly dividend and increased its stock repurchase program.  With over $1.6 billion in cash and investments, Xilinx remains the industry's only investment grade PLD company.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
In addition to receiving base salary, Xilinx executive officers will participate in a new Executive Bonus Program, effective April 1, 2005, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors on August 3, 2005.  Executive officers will not be participating in the Pay for Xilinx Performance incentive program while participating in this new Executive Bonus Program.
 
Each executive officer participating in the Executive Bonus Program has a bonus target ranging from 50% to 70% of the individual's base pay.   The Executive Bonus Program has two components that are measured quarterly and weighted as follows:  actual company revenue versus the revenue goal set at the beginning of the fiscal year (two-thirds) and the individual's expense performance against the individual's assigned expense budget for the quarter (one-third).  Revenue and expense performance are determined after each quarter's earnings release to the public.  If the quarterly goals are missed for either component, the individual will not receive a bonus attributed to the missed component.  If an officer's expenses for the fiscal year come in at or under the year's expense budget, the officer will receive the unpaid balance of the target bonus for the expense performance component.
 
The Executive Bonus Program has a third component that is measured at the end of the fiscal year after the fiscal year's earnings have been released to the public.  If the sum of the four fiscal quarters' revenue performance exceeds the annual revenue goal for the fiscal year, the eligible bonus increases by three times the amount over which the goal was exceeded.  In this case, each executive officer is entitled to a year-end payment of the difference between the quarterly payments received for quarterly revenue component performance and the amount earned under the accelerator for exceeding the annual revenue goal.  For instance, if it is determined after the fiscal year's earnings are announced that Xilinx achieved 120% of its annual revenue goal, the Executive Bonus payout of the revenue component increases to 160% ([3 x 20%] + 100%).  If only 50% of the revenue component of the Executive Bonus had been paid prior to the end of the fiscal year, the individual would receive a subsequent payment of the remaining 110% to bring the total amount paid to 160% of target.  The accelerator is only used on the revenue portion of the Executive Bonus Program.
 
The Chief Executive Officer's incentive compensation will be a hybrid as follows:  two-thirds of his target bonus (70%) will be earned according to the metrics and weighting of the Executive Bonus Program described above and one-third will be earned by his performance against specific goals set and evaluated by the Board of Directors on an annual basis.
 
Amounts payable under the incentive compensation programs described herein are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On August 8, 2005, Xilinx, Inc. (the "Registrant") filed on Form 8-K a summary of a new executive bonus program ("Form 8-K"). This Amendment No. 1 to the Form 8-K is being filed to clarify the executive bonus program, specifically with regard to the revenue growth goal.   The entire summary of the executive bonus program is restated herein.
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
In addition to receiving base salary, Xilinx executive officers will participate in a new Executive Bonus Program, effective April 1, 2005, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors on August 3, 2005.

Each executive officer participating in the Executive Bonus Program has a bonus target ranging from 50% to 70% of the individual's base pay.   The Executive Bonus Program has two components that are measured quarterly and weighted as follows:  actual company revenue versus the revenue growth rate goal set at the beginning of the fiscal year (two-thirds) and the individual's expense performance against the individual's assigned expense budget for the quarter (one-third).  Revenue and expense performance are determined after each quarter's earnings release to the public.  If the quarterly goals are missed for either component, the individual will not receive a bonus attributed to the missed component.

The Executive Bonus Program has a third component that is measured at the end of the fiscal year after the fiscal year's earnings have been released to the public.  If the sum of the four fiscal quarters' revenue performance exceeds the annual revenue growth rate goal for the fiscal year, the eligible bonus increases by three times the amount over which the goal was exceeded.

Item 8.01  Other Events.
 
On August 30, 2005, the U.S. Tax Court issued its ruling in favor of the Company on all matters not previously settled regarding fiscal years 1996 through 1999.  The substantive issue, tried in July 2004, was whether the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Company's cost sharing agreement with the Company's Irish affiliate.  The Court found that the Company's cost sharing agreement met the arm's-length standard of the IRS Tax Regulations and that unrelated parties would not share the spread or grant date value of compensatory stock options.  The Court further found that the regulations applicable to the tax years at issue did not require the Company to include the value of compensatory stock options in its cost sharing agreements.  Accordingly, the Company was not liable for any tax, penalties or interest associated with the IRS assertions.
 
The Company is in the process of evaluating the full accounting implications of this decision on tax years 1996-1999 and all subsequent impacted years.  Based upon our initial analysis, the Company expects that there will be a favorable impact of $7 to $9 million to net income for reversal of prior reserves related to this issue.  In addition, there could be additional positive impact of $3 to $4 million for interest income, net of tax resulting from a refund due to the Company.
 
It is unknown at this time whether the IRS will seek reconsideration or appeal the ruling.  Whether the IRS does so could have future financial implications.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
September 2, 2005, SAN JOSE, Calif. Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX), announced that the U.S. Tax Court issued a favorable opinion regarding the Company's allocation of costs with its Irish subsidiary. The case dealt with cost sharing, a common practice for developing new intangibles and products for multinational companies. This issue was tried in July 2004 for the Company's fiscal years 1996 through 1999.  The Court concluded that the Company was not liable for any tax, penalties or interest associated with the IRS assertions.
 
In the decision, the Court found that the Company's cost sharing agreement, which did not include any sharing of cost for stock option expenses, met the arm's-length standard of the IRS Tax Regulations and that unrelated parties would not share the spread or grant date value of stock options ("arm's-length" refers to how entities would normally conduct business, even if the entities are related as subsidiaries or through other business relationships).  The Court further found that the regulations applicable to the tax years at issue did not require the Company to include stock options in its cost sharing agreements.
 
The Company is in the process of evaluating the full accounting implications of this decision on tax years 1996-1999 and all subsequent impacted years.  Based upon its initial analysis, the Company expects that there will be a favorable impact of $7 to $9 million to net income for reversal of prior reserves related to this issue.  In addition, there could be an additional positive
impact of $3 to $4 million for interest income, net of tax resulting from a refund due to the Company.
 
"This is an important decision for Xilinx and for other affected high tech companies" said Joe Forgy, Vice President, Tax at Xilinx.  "For Xilinx, the decision is an important part of our strategy to serve a worldwide marketplace with innovative products.  We would like to thank our excellent legal team at Fenwick & West, our expert and fact witnesses and all others in our industry that supported our case."

Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
Turns business, which are orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter, were weaker than anticipated in the month of September.  Most of this weakness was concentrated among large communications and storage companies that have manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific.  Combined sales from Xilinx's 90-nanometer products, Virtex-4 and Spartan-3, doubled sequentially, meeting expectations and representing 10% of total revenues.
 
"The September quarter was a challenging quarter.  I am pleased, however, with the growth of our 90nm products.  Additionally, significant yield improvements on these products during the quarter positively impacted gross margin which increased to 61.4%, up from 60.9% in the prior quarter," said Wim Roelandts, Chairman and CEO.

XILINX RAISES DECEMBER QUARTER SALES GUIDANCE
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the December quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, DECEMBER 7, 2005
 
December quarter sales are now expected to increase 4% to 8% sequentially as a result of better than expected sales from customers in North America and Asia Pacific.  This is up from prior guidance of up 1% to 5% sequentially.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin guidance of 62% to 63% is unchanged.
 - 
                 
 
Pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the company has elected to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings.  As a consequence, the company will record a tax charge of approximately $27 million in the December quarter related to the extraordinary dividend.
 - 
                 
 
The effective tax rate for the year, excluding the repatriation, is expected to increase to 23%, up from previous guidance of 21% - 22%.  This is due to greater forecasted profits in the United States than originally expected.
 - 
                 
 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision.  Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its third quarter financial results on January 19, 2006.

XILINX ANNOUNCES DECEMBER QUARTER RESULTS;
NEW PRODUCT SALES INCREASE 24% SEQUENTIALLY.
 
SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 19, 2006
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $450 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006,
up 13% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 27% from the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter n
et income was $81 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $86 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the prior quarter.
 
The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 includes a $25.3 million charge related to the planned repatriation of $500 million in foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $9.5 million primarily related to the ability to use certain credits that were previously accounted for as unusable.  The net impact of these items added $15.8 million to the Company's third quarter tax provision.
 
Xilinx also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2006 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2006.
 
Additional third quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below.
 
Quarterly Information
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
December quarter sales were better than expected as a result of broad based product and end market strength.  Sales from each of Xilinx's Virtex products were strong during the quarter contributing to strength in both the New and Mainstream product categories.  From an end market perspective, sales from the Industrial and Other category were particularly strong, fueled by applications in defense and test and measurement.
 
"Xilinx's New Product sales were strong in the third quarter," said Wim Roelandts, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.  "Sales from these products increased 24% sequentially driven by strong sales of Xilinx's Virtex-4, Virtex-II Pro, Spartan-3 and CoolRunner-II families.  New Products currently represent 33% of total sales, up from 30% last quarter and up from 20% in the same quarter a year ago.  I am also pleased with our continued manufacturing efficiencies and solid financial management which contributed to improved gross and operating margins.  Gross margin in the quarter increased to 63%, up from 61% in the prior quarter and operating margin increased to 27%, up from 21% in the prior quarter."

Sevcik has been instrumental in fueling the company's growth from a $500M company in 1997 to nearly $1.6B in calendar year 2005, and establishing its position as the world's leading programmable solutions supplier, with 57 percent market segment share for field programmable logic devices (FPGAs). Sevcik has also played an integral role in the company's success with dual-foundry partners UMC and Toshiba, which resulted in delivery of the world's first 90nm FPGA in 2003 and demonstration of the world's first 65nm generation Virtex FPGAs at the Globalpress Summit 2006 (Monterey, Calif.).
 
"It has been my honor to know Rich as both a colleague and friend for more than 20 years, spanning our careers at both Xilinx and Hewlett-Packard," said Roelandts. "Rich has made a tremendous and enduring impact on Xilinx from his early days to today. His boundless energy will sorely be missed  and I have no doubt that his imprint upon the company will have a lasting impact on the success of Xilinx in the years to come."

"It's been a privilege to work alongside the industry's best and brightest engineering and executive management talent at Xilinx  and to play a supporting role in the evolution of the FPGA to a true system-level platform that is increasingly at the heart of today's electronic systems," added Sevcik. "I'm confident that the Xilinx team will continue to create innovative software and hardware FPGA products, with utmost attention to satisfying today's customer needs  and to anticipating their future requirements, as the FPGA continues its march toward ubiquity in the electronics industry."
 
Sevcik joined Xilinx in 1997 from Hewlett-Packard, where he has served as Vice President and group general manager of HP's Systems Technology Group. He received his Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from the University of Illinois and his Master's degree in Solid State Physics from Northwestern University.

XILINX ANNOUNCES RECORD REVENUES AND RAISES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND;
NEW PRODUCT SALES INCREASE 18% SEQUENTIALLY.
 
SAN JOSE, CA, APRIL 26, 2006
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $472.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,
up 5% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 21% from the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter n
et income was $110.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, including a $4.5 million acquisition-related charge. The tax provision for the fourth quarter includes an $8.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit related to prior year adjustments driven primarily by an over provision of state income taxes. This is compared to net income of $81.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the prior quarter.
 
Xilinx also announced today that the Company's Board of Directors increased its quarterly cash dividend from $0.07 to $0.09 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on May 31, 2006 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2006.

Highlights  Fiscal Year 2006:
 
Introduced in September 2004, the Virtex-4 family of FPGAs now generates more in 90nm sales than any other PLD family. Strong design win activity from broad-based end markets drove significant sales growth from all three domain-optimized platforms in fiscal 2006. Virtex-4 FPGAs were named Ultimate Product of the Year at the Annual Creativity in Electronics (ACE) 2006 Award Gala, which recognized the electronics engineering industry's most innovative companies and breakthrough technologies.
 - 
                       
EE Times
 
For the 8th consecutive year, sales from the Xilinx Spartan Series increased as a percentage of total sales representing a record 24% of total net revenues in fiscal year 2006, up from 21% last year and up from 8% five years ago. The success of the Spartan series is reflected in increased sales exposure to high-volume applications such as consumer, automotive and high-volume networking as well as in the total number of Spartan customers which has increased by almost 60% over the last five years. While
 - 
                       
the Virtex-4 family claims 90nm FPGA sales leadership, the Spartan-3 family maintains leadership in number of 90nm units shipped.
 
Fiscal 2006 marked the 5th consecutive year of market segment share gains for Xilinx CPLDs. Currently, Xilinx estimates its share of the CPLD segment to be over 28%, up from 12% five years ago. Market segment share gains and record CPLD sales are primarily due to the success of the Xilinx low-power CoolRunner Series, which has made significant advances into the portable applications space, most notably handheld devices.
 - 
                       
 
In March 2006, Xilinx demonstrated first silicon of its new 65nm generation Virtex FPGA family and has started delivering software and engineering samples to early access customers.
 - 
                       
 
Xilinx unveiled a strategy and set of product roadmaps to address the $2 billion high-performance DSP market, including XtremeDSP solutions that accelerate the development of multimedia, video and imaging systems. Additionally, Xilinx strengthened its commitment to FPGA-based DSP system design with the acquisition of AccelChip, Inc., a provider of DSP design tools.
 - 
                       
 
In December 2005, Xilinx announced the 8.1i release of its popular Integrated Software Environment (ISE) design tool suite with enhanced physical synthesis capabilities to improve performance and timing closure for both the Virtex-4 and Spartan-3 architectures. Earlier in the year, Xilinx introduced version 4.00 of its MicroBlaze soft processor, which enables embedded developers to accelerate system performance by as much as 120 times over software emulation.

Previously, the bylaws required that written notice of a nomination for diretor or other stockholder proposal be provided no less than ninety (90) days prior to the stockholder meeting at which the nomination or other matter is intended to be raised.
 
Section 3.2 was amended to change the size of the Board of Directors from a fixed number of 10 directors to a range of seven to eleven directors, with the exact number to be fixed by the Board of Diretors.  This range shall not be altered without prior stockholder approval.
 
Section 3.4 of the bylaws was amended to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections.  A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.  In contested elections, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
 
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors (the "Board").  Within 120 days of the certification of election results, the Board will publicly disclose its decision regarding whether to accept or reject the resignation and the rationale behind it.  The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.  If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board.
 
The resolution of the Board of Directors amending the bylaws is effective as of May 3, 2006 and is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER
 
"Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting; that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

For the purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director.  If a director is not elected, such director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the board of directors.  The board of directors will decide whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action shall be taken.  The board of directors will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it promptly but no later than 120 days following the date of the certification of the election results.  In reaching its decision, the board of directors may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the corporation, the overall composition of the board of directors, the underlying reasons for the outcome of the stockholders' vote with respect to the director (if ascertainable) and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation.  No director who so offers to tender his or her resignation shall participate in the board of directors' decision or in the nominating and governance
provided
committee's recommendation.  If a majority of the members of the nominating and governance committee fail to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director at the same meeting of stockholders, then the independent directors who did receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director will appoint a committee of the board of directors amongst themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and making a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to such tendered resignations.  If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the purpose of electing directors where the election is uncontested, the incumbent board of directors will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote.  In this circumstance, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.3, the incumbent board of directors will continue to serve until new directors are elected and qualified."
 
APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS this 3rd day of May, 2006.

EXHIBIT 99.2
XILINX, INC. BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
1)
Role of Board and Management
            
The Company's business is conducted by its employees, managers and officers, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to enhance the long term value of the Company for its stockholders. The Board of Directors (the Board) is elected by the stockholders to oversee management and to assure that management recognizes that the long-term interests of stockholders are advanced by responsibly addressing the concerns of other stakeholders and interested parties including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, government officials and the public at large.
 
2)
Functions of the Board
            
 
The Board meets pursuant to a regular schedule agreed upon by the directors one year in advance. The Board also meets as necessary to address specific issues. At the meetings, the Board reviews and discusses reports by management on the performance of the company, its plans and prospects, as well as immediate issues facing the company. In addition to its general oversight of management, the Board also performs a number of specific functions, including:
 
a)
             
Selecting, evaluating and compensating the chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and overseeing planning for his or her succession;
 
b)
            
Reviewing, monitoring and where appropriate, approving fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions;
 
c)
             
Assessing major risks facing the company and reviewing options for their mitigation;
 
d)
            
Ensuring processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the companythe integrity of the financial statements and internal controls, the integrity of compliance with law and ethics and compliance and enforcement programs, integrity of relationships with customers and suppliers, and the integrity of relationships with other stakeholders; and
 
e)
             
Evaluating director or executive officer requests for a waiver of the codes of ethics and/or conduct.
 
3)
Board Membership Criteria and Composition
            
The Nominating and Governance Committee annually evaluates the Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members. In evaluating the suitability of individual Board members, the Board takes into account many factors, including issues of diversity in numerous factors such as: understanding of and experience in semiconductor technology, finance and marketing; international experience; availability; independence; strategic vision; and culture. These factors, and others considered useful by the Board, are reviewed in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at a particular point in time and in evaluating future candidates for Board membership.
Board members are expected to prepare for, attend, and participate in all Board and applicable committee meetings. Each Board member is expected to ensure that other existing and planned future commitments do not materially interfere with the member's service as a Director. These other commitments will be considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board when reviewing Board candidates and in connection with the Board's annual evaluation process.
 
a)
             
Independence
 
Xilinx defines an "independent" Director in accord with the NASDAQ National Market Issuer requirements for independent Directors (NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 4200) and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
i.
                                         
 
The Board believes there should be a substantial majority of independent Directors on the Board. The Board also believes it is appropriate to have members of management on the Board.
ii.
                                      
 
All members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent Directors.
iii.
                                   
 
The Committee chairs are actively involved in setting the agendas of their respective Committee meetings.
iv.
                                  
 
Independent Directors meet outside the presence of members of Management and hold such meetings regularly.
v.
                                     
 
Lead Independent Director
b)
            
 
It is the policy of the Board that if the Chairman is also the CEO of the Company, the Board will designate an independent Director to serve as Lead Independent Director, who is responsible for coordinating the activities of the independent Directors, as well as other duties, including chairing meetings among the independent Directors.
 
c)
             
Term Limitations
 
The Board believes that term limits on Directors' service and a mandatory retirement age do not serve the best interests of the Company. While such policies could help ensure that fresh ideas and new viewpoints are addressed by the Board, such limits have the disadvantage of losing the contribution of Directors who over time have developed increased insight and knowledge into the Company's operations and who remain active and contributing members of the Board. The Board evaluation process plays a significant role in determining Board tenure.
d)
            
Change of Principle Occupation or Association
 
When a Director's principal occupation or business association changes substantially during his or her tenure as Director, that Director shall tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee will recommend to the Board the action, if any, to be taken with respect to the resignation.
 
e)
             
New Director Policy and Process
 
The Directors are elected each year by the stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders. In uncontested elections the Directors are elected by a majority vote; if elections are contested the vote is by a plurality. Stockholders may propose nominees for consideration by the Nominating and Governance committee by submitting the names and supporting information to: Secretary, Xilinx, Inc. 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, corporate.secretary@xilinx.com, or by fax to (408) 377-6137. The Board proposes a slate of nominees to the stockholders for election to the Board. Between annual stockholder meetings, the Board may elect Directors to serve until the next annual meeting. Consideration of new candidates, regardless of whether proposed by management, the Board or a stockholder, typically involves a series of internal discussions, review of background information and interviews with select candidates.
 
f)
               
Board Compensation Policy
 
It is the general policy of the Board that Board compensation should be a mix of cash and equity-based compensation. Directors who are members of management will not be paid for Board membership in addition to their regular employee compensation. Independent Directors may not receive consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from the Company in addition to their Board compensation.
 
The staff of the Company will report on a regular basis to the Compensation Committee on the status of Board compensation in relation to other representative U.S. companies.
 
g)

Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 25, 2006, Xilinx, Inc. issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2006. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measuresXilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations. Xilinx management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in its internal reviews of the financial results of the Company, its presentations of results and forecasts to the Board of Directors and its establishment of internal budgets. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and facilitates comparisons to internal performance forecasts and comparisons with other companies in our industry that separately identify stock-based compensation. Management further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income (including cost of revenues, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense), that it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items in the statements of income are affected by these adjustments. In particular, as Xilinx begins to apply SFAS 123(R), the Company believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123(R) are being reflected on the Company's statements of income.
.
The Company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS 123(R), under which the effects of stock-based compensation are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but are not reflected in results for prior periods. Gross margin, expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income and net income per share are the primary financial measures that management uses for planning and forecasting future periods which are affected by stock-based compensation. Because management reviews these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under SFAS 123(R), these financial measures are treated as "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $481.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, up 2% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 19% from the same quarter a year ago. First quarter net income of $82.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, included stock-based compensation of $26.8 million. The Company began expensing stock options in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and, therefore, equivalent stock-based compensation expense was not reflected in the year-ago period when the Company earned $76.8 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.
SAN JOSE, CA, JULY 25, 2006
company has in nearly all cases followed a policy of issuing its stock options on pre-set dates. The investigation into our stock option practices is not yet complete. We anticipate its completion prior to filing the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Included in our results is a $1.5 million charge related to minor differences between approval documentation and certain recorded stock option grant dates. This one time charge was not material to any particular quarter in the Company's history, and thus there is no restatement to the Company's financial statements. The

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Xilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and their use by Company management, see the Form 8-K dated July 25, 2006 that Xilinx has filed with the SEC.

Item 8.01  Other Events
On August 25, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a Notice of Appeal (Appeal) that it appeals to the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit the August 30, 2005 decision of the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court). In its 2005 decision, the Tax Court decided in favor of the Company and rejected the IRS's position that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Company's cost sharing agreement with its Irish affiliate.
The Company intends to oppose this Appeal as it believes that the Tax Court decided the case correctly, although there can be no assurances with respect to the outcome at this time. Furthermore, the Company expects that the Appeal will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
XILINX PROVIDES SEPTEMBER QUARTER FY07 BUSINESS UPDATE
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced its business update for the September quarter of fiscal 2007.  The Company now expects September quarter sales to decline 4% to 7% sequentially.  This is a revision from previous sales guidance of flat to down 5% sequentially, and is a result of lower than anticipated sales from the Asia Pacific region.
SAN JOSE, CA, SEPTEMBER 13, 2006
This release contains forward-looking statements and projections. Actual events and results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties including the general health of global economies as well as of the semiconductor industry, the health of our end markets and our customers' customers, our ability to forecast end customer demand, customer acceptance of our new products, greater than expected mix shift within the new products category or greater than expected decline in mainstream products, the ability of our customers to manage their inventories, a high dependence on turns business, higher-than-anticipated product delinquencies, more customer volume discounts than expected, our ability to deliver product in a timely manner, our ability to secure meaningful wafer capacity from our suppliers, our ability to secure adequate test, packaging and assembly capacity from our suppliers, our ability to successfully manage production at multiple foundries, and other risk factors listed in our most recent Form 10-K.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 19, 2006, Xilinx, Inc. issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006.  A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measuresXilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations.  Xilinx management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in its internal reviews of the financial results of the Company, its presentations of results and forecasts to the Board of Directors and its establishment of internal budgets. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and facilitates comparisons to internal performance forecasts and comparisons with other companies in our industry that separately identify stock-based compensation.  Management further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income (including cost of revenues, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense), that it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items in the statements of income are affected by these adjustments.  In particular, as Xilinx begins to apply SFAS 123(R), the Company believes that it
.
is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123(R) are being reflected on the Company's statements of income.
The Company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS 123(R), under which the effects of stock-based compensation are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but are not reflected in results for prior periods.  Gross margin, expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income and net income per share are the primary financial measures that management uses for planning and forecasting future periods which are affected by stock-based compensation.  Because management reviews these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under SFAS 123(R), these financial measures are treated as "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

XILINX ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2007 RESULTS; $0.27 EPS
SAN JOSE, CA, OCTOBER 19, 2006
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $467.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
down 3% sequentially from the prior quarter and up 17% from the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter net income of $93.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, increased 13% from the prior quarter, and included stock-based compensation of $21.9 million.
Xilinx also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on December 6, 2006 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2006.
Additional second quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below:
GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
 
Results excluding the effects of stock-based compensation
(In millions, except EPS)
 
 
Sales to wireline and wireless communications end markets were particularly weak during the quarter as a result of inventory rebalancing and consolidation activity among several large customers.  All other end markets were up sequentially with the Industrial and Other category posting the strongest sales growth due primarily to strength from defense applications.
"In spite of a seasonally weak quarter, I am pleased with the growth of our New Products, which increased 18% sequentially.  Sales from 90-nanometer (nm) and 65nm products were particularly strong during the quarter representing over 20% of total sales, up from less than 10% a year ago.  Our success on these process nodes is a reflection of our clear technology leadership," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx chief executive officer.  "Additionally, the rollout of our latest Virtex-5 family, the industry's first field programmable gate array (FPGA) family on 65nm technology, remains on schedule and significantly ahead of competition."
 
Business Review  September Quarter FY07
Total inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 126 days, up from 117 days last quarter.
                 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 36, up from 29 in the prior quarter.

Xilinx's 8.2i Integrated Software Environment (ISE) offers full support for Virtex-5 devices, including the Virtex-5 LX330 FPGA, the industry's highest density 65nm FPGA.  Xilinx remains the only PLD company to ship 65nm products.

XILINX ANNOUNCES TERMINATION OF SEC INVESTIGATION
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally notified Xilinx that its investigation of Xilinx's stock option granting practices has been terminated and that no enforcement action has been recommended.  As Xilinx disclosed in June 2006, the Company received notice from the SEC advising that the SEC had commenced an informal inquiry into the Company's historical stock option-granting practices.
SAN JOSE, CA, NOVEMBER 30, 2006
As previously reported, under the direction of a Special Committee of the Board of Directors, outside counsel conducted an investigation of the Company's historical stock option-granting practices and found no evidence of fraud in the Company's practices in granting of stock options, nor any evidence of manipulation of the timing or exercise price of stock option grants.  The investigation further found no issues of management integrity in the issuance of stock options.  The investigation determined that in nearly all cases, stock options were issued as of pre-set dates.
The SEC's notification followed an August 31, 2006, presentation by outside counsel and the Company to the SEC staff regarding the results of the Company's investigation.
"We are extremely pleased to receive this notification from the SEC.  We also would like to thank the members of our Special Committee for their comprehensive work in connection with the investigation," stated Wim Roelandts, Xilinx's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 18, 2007, Xilinx, Inc. issued a press release announcing results for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2006.  A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measuresXilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations.  Xilinx management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in its internal reviews of the financial results of the Company, its presentations of results and forecasts to the Board of Directors and its establishment of internal budgets. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and facilitates comparisons to internal performance forecasts and comparisons with other companies in our industry that separately identify stock-based compensation.  Management further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income (including cost of revenues, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense), that it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items in the statements of income are affected by these adjustments.  In particular, as Xilinx begins to apply SFAS 123(R), the Company believes that it
.
2
is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123(R) are being reflected on the Company's statements of income.
The Company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS 123(R), under which the effects of stock-based compensation are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but are not reflected in results for prior periods.  Gross margin, expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income and net income per share are the primary financial measures that management uses for planning and forecasting future periods which are affected by stock-based compensation.  Because management reviews these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under SFAS 123(R), these financial measures are treated as "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

down 4% sequentially from the prior quarter and flat with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter net income of $87.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, decreased 6% from the prior quarter, and included stock-based compensation of $21.4 million.  Third quarter net income also included a tax benefit of approximately $0.02 per diluted share related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a reduction in the fiscal 2006 income tax provision.
Xilinx also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on February 28, 2007 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2007.

Highlights  December Quarter Fiscal 2007:
Xilinx sales from products manufactured using 90nm and 65nm process technologies increased to a record 24% of total sales, up from 11% in the same quarter a year ago.  Based on cumulative revenues, Xilinx continues to demonstrate its technology leadership by supplying approximately 70% of the world's 90nm field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and 100% of the world's 65nm FPGAs.
                 
In December 2006, Xilinx shipped the industry's highest density FPGA. Developed using an advanced power-saving 65nm process technology, the Virtex-5 LX330 FPGA delivers 65% more logic than the largest 90nm FPGAs. Xilinx foundry
                 
2
      partners UMC and Toshiba have ramped production on their 65nm processes quickly and with excellent yields, allowing Xilinx to deliver the complete 65nm Virtex-5 LX platform on time and over one year ahead of its competition.
     
Xilinx began shipping its Spartan-3A family of I/O-optimized FPGAs, an extension of its low-cost, high volume Spartan-3 Generation. The Spartan-3A platform provides a cost-reduced solution for applications where I/O count and capabilities matter more than logic density. With support for the industry's widest range of I/O standards (26) and unique power, configuration capabilities and anti-cloning security advantages, Spartan-3A FPGAs provide a flexible and cost-saving solution to new high-volume applications within consumer and industrial end markets, such as display panel interfaces, video/tuner board interfaces and video switching.

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Xilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations.  For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and their use by Company management, see the Form 8-K dated January 18, 2007 that Xilinx has filed with the SEC.

XILINX TO OFFER $900 MILLION JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
 
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced that it proposes to offer $900 million of convertible junior subordinated debentures, subject to market conditions and other factors. The debentures would be due in 2037 and are to be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The conversion rate and other terms will be determined by negotiations between the Company and the initial purchaser of the debentures. Xilinx has also granted to the initial purchaser of the debentures the right to purchase up to an additional $100 million principal amount of debentures solely to cover overallotments.
SAN JOSE, CA, FEBRUARY 26, 2007
 
Xilinx intends to use the majority of the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase its common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program and/or from institutional investors in negotiated transactions concurrent with this offering. The repurchases of shares of common stock by the Company are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the debentures. The other party to the accelerated share repurchase program may buy or sell Xilinx common stock in the secondary market to hedge its position. Xilinx also intends to continue to purchase shares under its existing share repurchase program.
 
Xilinx intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the initial purchaser exercises its overallotment option, Xilinx may use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional debentures to repurchase additional shares of its common stock.
 
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
 
The debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risk and uncertainties include, but are not limited to whether or not Xilinx will offer the debentures or consummate the offering, the anticipated terms of the debentures and the offering and the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering.

SAN JOSE, CA, FEBRUARY 26, 2007 
 
Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced that its Board of Directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.12 from $0.09 per common share.

Our Board of Directors and our management team remain committed to returning value to our stockholders and continue to recognize dividends as a key element of this strategy," stated Wim Roelandts, chairman and chief executive officer.
 
Xilinx today also announced that its Board of Directors has approved the authorization, effective immediately, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock. This amount is in addition to the approximately $175 million remaining from Xilinx's previous share repurchase program.
 
The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions.
Under this authorization, Xilinx intends to repurchase its common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program and/or from institutional investors in negotiated transactions, as well as in the open market pursuant to Xilinx's existing share repurchase program.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
The debentures were offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On March 5, 2007, Xilinx, Inc. ("Xilinx") issued $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2037 (the "debentures") to an initial purchaser (the "initial purchaser"). 
The debentures are governed by an indenture, dated as of March 5, 2007 (the "indenture"), between Xilinx and Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
The debentures will bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2007. The debentures will mature on March 15, 2037, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted.  The debentures are convertible, in certain circumstances, into shares of Xilinx's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Xilinx common stock").  Holders of the debentures who convert their debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, the holders of the debentures may require Xilinx to purchase all or a portion of their debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.  For additional information about the conversion rights of the debentures, see Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The debentures and the underlying Xilinx common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
In connection with the sale of the debentures, Xilinx entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of March 5, 2007, with the initial purchaser (the "registration rights agreement"). Under the registration rights agreement, Xilinx has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective, within 180 days after the issuance of the debentures, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the debentures and the shares of Xilinx common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures.  Subject to certain exceptions, Xilinx shall use its reasonable efforts, subject to provisions of the registration rights agreement, to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by holders until the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the closing date and (ii) such time as the securities cease to be a Registrable Security (as defined in the registration rights agreement).Xilinx will be required to pay additional interest, subject to some limitations, to the holders of the debentures if it fails to comply with its obligations to register the debentures and the Xilinx common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures.
 
Item 3.02.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On February 27, 2007, Xilinx entered into a definitive agreement to offer and sell the debentures.  The debentures were offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The debentures are convertible, as described below, into Xilinx common stock at an initial conversion rate of 32.0760 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures equal to a conversion price of approximately $31.18 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment.  Upon conversion, Xilinx will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted and the total conversion obligation. We will deliver shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at our option, for the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation.
2
Holders of the debentures may convert their debentures on or after December 15, 2036 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date.  Prior to December 15, 2036, holders may convert their debentures under any of the following conditions:
during the five business-day period after any ten consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per debenture for each day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Xilinx common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; or
                 
during any fiscal quarter beginning after June 30, 2007, if the last reported sale price of Xilinx common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or
                 
if Xilinx calls any and all debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
                 
upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions.
                 
.
Xilinx expects to pay an estimated aggregate of approximately $18 million of offering expenses in connection with the transaction, including discounts and commissions.  The offering closed on March 5, 2007
Xilinx is filing the information above under Item 3.02.  However, as a result of the obligations under the debentures upon conversion being payable in cash as described above, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures may constitute less than 1% of the number of shares outstanding of the common stock of Xilinx.
Item 8.01.  Other Events.
Xilinx intends to use approximately $850,000,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase its common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, from institutional investors in negotiated transactions concurrent with this offering and in additional repurchases under its existing share repurchase program.  On February 27, 2007, Xilinx entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR agreement") with the initial purchaser of the debentures in which Xilinx will repurchase a number of shares of its common stock for a purchase price equal to $700,000,000.  The actual purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the accelerated share repurchase program will be determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of Xilinx common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement.  The exact number of shares repurchased pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase program will be determined based on such adjusted price.  The counterparty to the ASR agreement may buy or sell Xilinx common stock in the secondary market to hedge its position.
On February 28, 2007, Xilinx issued a press release with respect to the foregoing transactions.  As required by Rule 135c under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this press release is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

XILINX UPDATES MARCH QUARTER GUIDANCE
 Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today released its business update for the March quarter of fiscal 2007.
SAN JOSE, CA, MARCH 5, 2007
March quarter sales guidance range has been narrowed to flat to down 4% sequentially.  This is a change from flat to down 5% sequentially.
                 
Gross margin guidance is unchanged and expected to be approximately 61%, including $2 million of stock-based compensation.
                 
As a result of the convertible debt offering and concurrent share buyback, Xilinx expects the share count reduction to have a minimal impact to fourth quarter 2007 results. Other Income will be approximately $19 million. For fiscal year 2008, the Company expects a fully diluted share count of approximately 300 million based on the current stock price. Other Income will decline by approximately $31-32 million per year. All the repurchases of common stock are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the debentures.
                 
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision. Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its fourth quarter financial results on April 25, 2007.
To receive Xilinx press releases automatically via email, please sign up for a push email alert, which is available from our investor relations website at: http://www.investor.xilinx.com.
This release contains forward-looking statements and projections. Actual events and results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties including the general health of global economies as well as of the semiconductor industry, a high reliance on turns business which is defined as business that is booked and shipped within the quarter, the health of our end markets and our customers' customers, our ability to forecast end customer demand, inventory levels at customers and throughout the supply chain, product mix shift to our newer products, which have lower gross margins, customer acceptance of our new products, and other risk factors listed in our most recent Form 10K.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 25, 2007, Xilinx, Inc. issued a press release announcing results for both the fiscal quarter ended and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the Company exclude the statement of income effects of all forms of stock-based compensation and the effects of SFAS 123(R) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP measures and may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Xilinx believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and our reconciliations, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Xilinx's financial condition and results of operations. Xilinx management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in its internal reviews of the financial results of the Company, its presentations of results and forecasts to the Board of Directors and its establishment of internal budgets. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and facilitates comparisons to internal performance forecasts and comparisons with other companies in our industry that separately identify stock-based compensation. Management further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income (including cost of revenues, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense), that it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items in the statements of income are affected by these adjustments. In particular, the Company believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123(R) are being reflected on the Company's statements of income.
The Company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS 123(R), under which the effects of stock-based compensation are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but are not reflected in results for prior periods. Gross margin, expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income and net income per share are the primary financial measures that management uses for planning and forecasting future periods which are affected by stock-based compensation. Because management reviews these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under SFAS 123(R), these financial measures are treated as "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
Item 9.01     Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits

Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $443.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, down 2% sequentially from the prior quarter and down 6% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter net income was $87.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, and included stock-based compensation expense of $20.1 million.
SAN JOSE, CA, APRIL 25, 2007 --
Net revenues of $1.84 billion in fiscal 2007 represented an increase of 7% from $1.73 billion in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2007 net income was $350.7 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, and included $92.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
As previously announced on February 26, 2007, the Xilinx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on May 30, 2007 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2007.

As anticipated, sales decreased in the March quarter driven primarily by declines in defense, wireless and consumer applications. "Sales from wired communication applications, which have been impacted by significant consolidation activity in the telecommunications end market, were up slightly during the quarter after two sequential quarters of steep declines," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx chief executive officer. "I view this as an optimistic sign that some stabilization in customer ordering patterns may be returning to this sector.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
     
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the grant of nonstatutory stock options ("Option") and the award of performance-based restricted stock units ("RSU Award") to the named executive officers identified below ("Participant"), for the following number of shares of the Company's common stock:
     
The above grants and awards were made pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and were effective as of July 2, 2007 (the "Grant Date").
     
Each Option was granted with an exercise price equal to $26.97, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the Grant Date. Each Option will, if not earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, terminate and cease to be exercisable on the seventh anniversary of the Grant Date. Subject to the Participant's continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting date, the Option will vest over the four-year period following the Grant Date in 48 substantially equal monthly installments.
     
An RSU Award represents the right of the Participant to receive on the vesting date, without payment of monetary consideration, a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the number of restricted stock units vesting on such date. Subject to the achievement of a specified performance goal and the Participant's continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting date, the RSU Award will vest over a four-year period in four annual installments on the anniversary of the Grant Date. The exact number of restricted stock units vesting on each annual vesting date will depend on the extent to which the performance goal is satisfied. The performance goal applicable to each annual vesting date is based on the average operating margin percentage achieved by the Company over the two-year period ending on the last day of the Company's most recently completed fiscal year, as compared to the average operating margin percentage of 20 other companies in the logic-based semiconductor industry identified by the Compensation Committee. In order to achieve 100% of the annual vesting amount, the Company must rank in the top one-third of the companies identified by the Compensation Committee.
     
A copy of the form of performance-based RSU Award agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the form of Option agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.24 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Options and RSU Awards are subject to the applicable provisions of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.23 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.
Item 9.01     Financial Statements and Exhibits:
(d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant
has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

RECITALS
     
A. The Board has adopted the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Consultants.
     
B. Participant is to render valuable services to the Company (or a Subsidiary), and this Restricted Stock Unit Issuance Agreement (the "Agreement") is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Company's award of Restricted Stock Units to Participant under the Plan.
     
C. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Plan.
NOW, THEREFORE
, it is hereby agreed as follows:
     
1.
Grant of Restricted Stock Units
. The Company hereby awards to Participant, as of the Award Date, the Number of Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Award Summary below (the "Award"). The Restricted Stock Units are awarded pursuant to and in all respects subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, as amended to the Award Date, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one Share on the specified issuance date provided that such unit becomes a Vested RSU. The terms and conditions governing the Award shall be as set forth in this Agreement.
     
Participant is not required to make any monetary payment (other than applicable taxes, if any) as a condition to receiving the Award or Shares issued upon settlement of the Award, the consideration for which shall be past services actually rendered and/or future services to be rendered to the Company (or Subsidiary) or for its benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to the Company (or Subsidiary) or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the Shares issued upon settlement of the Award.
     2. . No portion of this Award with respect to which
Limited Transferability
Shares have not been issued in settlement thereof shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of Participant or Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to the Award shall be exercisable during Participant's lifetime only by Participant or Participant's guardian or legal representative.
     
3.
Termination of Service
. Should Participant's Service cease or terminate for any reason prior to vesting in one or more RSUs subject to this Award (except to the extent of the additional vesting provided in the event of Participant's death, as set forth in
Exhibit A
attached hereto), then the Award will be immediately cancelled with respect to those RSUs which remain unvested as of the date of such termination of Service. Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled unvested RSUs and shall not be entitled to any payment therefor.
     
4. . Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares which may be issued in settlement of this Award until the date of the issuance of a certificate for such Shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 5.
Stockholder Rights
     
5.
Adjustment in Shares
. In the event of any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Shares resulting from the declaration or payment of a stock dividend, any recapitalization resulting in a stock split-up, or exchange of shares or other increase or decrease in such shares effected without the Company's receipt of consideration, then equitable adjustments shall be made to the total number of RSUs subject to the Award with respect to which Shares have not been issued and to the Shares issuable pursuant to this Award in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate.
6. .
     
Collection of Withholding Taxes
     
     
(a)
Until such time as the Company provides Participant with written or electronic notice to the contrary, Participant may pay the Withholding Taxes through one of the following methods:
          
(i)
Participant's delivery of his or her separate check payable to the Company in the amount of the Withholding Taxes,
          
(ii)
the use of the proceeds from a next-day sale of the Shares issued to Participant, provided and only if (A) such a sale is permissible under the Company's trading policies governing the sale of Shares, (B) Participant makes an irrevocable commitment, on or before the issuance date for those Shares, to effect such sale of the Shares and (C) the transaction is not otherwise deemed to constitute a prohibited loan under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or
          
(iii)
an automatic withholding procedure pursuant to which the Company will reduce, on the settlement date, the number of Vested RSUs that would otherwise be settled by the issuance of Shares by a number of Vested RSUs representing rights to receive Shares having a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the amount of the Withholding Taxes (the "RSU Withholding Method");
provided, however
, that the amount of any Vested RSUs so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Companys required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes that are applicable to supplemental taxable income.
     
     
(b)
In the event the Company has not received from Participant on or before the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Award, (A) payment in accordance with Section 6(a)(i) above or (B) an irrevocable commitment to effect a next-day sale of the Shares in accordance with Section 6(a)(ii) above, then the Company shall automatically collect the Withholding Taxes through the RSU Withholding Method.
     
(c)
For purposes of this Agreement, "Withholding Taxes" shall mean (i) the employee portion of the federal, state and local employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company in connection with the vesting of RSUs under the Award and (ii) the federal, state and local income taxes required to be withheld by the Company in connection with the issuance of Shares in settlement of Vested RSUs.
     
7.
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
. The grant of the Award and issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.

ir@xilinx.com
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $445.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, up 1% sequentially from the prior quarter and down 7% compared to the same quarter a year ago. First quarter net income was $84.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share.
SAN JOSE, CA, JULY 19, 2007
The Xilinx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on September 5, 2007 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2007.
Additional first quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below:
GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
Sales from all geographies were in line with expectations with the exception of Europe. Weaker than anticipated European sales were driven primarily by customers in the Industrial and Data Processing Categories. Sales from Asia Pacific reached a record 29% of total sales, driven primarily by sales to communications customers in the region. New Product sales, which were slow in the prior quarter, increased 17% sequentially and represented 28% of total sales, up from 24% in the prior quarter. Sales from the Company's Virtex-5 FPGAs posted the strongest growth within this category.
"While sales growth was slightly lower than originally anticipated, I am pleased with our progress during the quarter in the areas of expense reduction and inventory management," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx chief executive officer. "Expense controls contributed in part to an operating margin of 22% for the quarter, up from 18% in the prior quarter. Xilinx inventory days decreased 16 days to 79 days--the lowest level in over three years and a direct result of focused supply chain management."
Business Review  June Quarter Fiscal 2008
Total inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 101 days, down from 120 days last quarter.  
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 43, up from 37 in the prior quarter.  
Capital expenditures and depreciation were $16 million and $12 million, respectively.
*Products are classified as follows:
New Products: Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-3, and CoolRunner II products
-
Mainstream Products: Virtex-II, Spartan-II, CoolRunner and Virtex-E products
Base Products: Virtex, Spartan, XC4000 and XC9500 products
Support Products: Configuration solutions, HardWire, Software & Support/Services
Highlights June Quarter Fiscal 2008:
Xilinx continued to strengthen its 65-nm leadership and is now shipping on schedule all Virtex-5 LX, LXT and SXT devices. Additionally, Xilinx has produced working silicon for its FXT product, expected to be introduced later this fiscal year.  
 
Xilinx began shipping the low-cost Spartan-DSP series targeting applications such as video surveillance and wireless. This family offers lower power and higher performance at the lowest cost points in the FPGA industry versus competing DSP solutions.
The Company recently introduced Integrated Software Environment (ISE) WebPACK 9.2i which offers software support for the Company's Virtex-5 FPGAs in addition to the latest Spartan-3A DSP platform FPGA. Also, following the successful launch of the PCI Express solution kit last quarter, Xilinx introduced two additional solution kits for gigabit Ethernet applications and memory interfaces. Solution kits simplify and accelerate broad adoption of advanced technologies by mainstream PLD designers.
Business Outlook  September Quarter Fiscal 2008
 
Revenues are expected to be flat to down slightly sequentially.
 
Gross margin is expected to be between 62% and 63%.
 
Operating expenses are expected to be up approximately 2% sequentially.
 
Other income including interest expense is expected to be approximately $16 million.
 
Tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%.
Fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately flat at 303 million shares.

ITEM: Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
     
On July 25, 2007, the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of its financial and strategic objectives. The Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the named executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2008, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 90% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other named executive officers range from 60% to 70% of their respective base salaries.
     
Under the Incentive Plan, the cash bonus for the CEO is determined using two components, each with a weighting of 50%, and the cash bonuses for all other named executive officers are determined using three components, each with a weighting of 33.3%. The two components for the target bonus for the CEO and two of the three components for the target bonuses for all other named executive officers are: (1) the Company's share of revenue (the "SOR Component"); and (2) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with GAAP (the "OP Component"). The third component for the target bonus for the other named executive officers is based on strategic objective goals pertaining to such officer's position and responsibilities (the "Strategic Component").
     
The SOR Component is designed to measure and reward increases in the Company's share of revenue as compared to benchmark programmable logic device companies identified by the Board of Directors. The SOR Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The SOR Component multiplier increases by 0.125 for each percentage point above the target and is capped at an annual maximum of 2.0. The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit on a quarterly basis, with the objective increasing in difficulty on a quarter-over-quarter basis. For the OP Component, each percentage point above a quarterly operating profit percentage target is subject to a multiplier of 0.5 and is capped at a maximum of 2.0.
     
The CEO's bonus will be paid annually based on the achievement of the year-end goals for the SOR Component and the OP Component. For all other named executive officers, the SOR Component will be paid quarterly and capped at the 0.5 multiplier, the OP Component will be paid quarterly and the Strategic Component will be paid annually. At the end of the fiscal year, the SOR Component quarterly payments that were subject to the 0.5 cap will be eligible for adjustment up to the 2.0 cap if warranted by Company performance, but will not be subject to a claw-back.
     
The Incentive Plan is effective as of April 1, 2007 and bonus payments will be made in August 2007 to the named executive officers other than the CEO in connection with the Company's performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant
    
has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On August 7, 2007, Xilinx, Inc. announced that Willem P. Roelandts, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board intends to retire from the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO").
     
A press release announcing the retirement of Mr. Roelandts is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
     
In connection with Mr. Roelandts' future retirement, as announced on August 7, 2007, we have entered into an executive succession agreement (the "Succession Agreement") with Mr. Roelandts pursuant to which he will remain President and CEO until a replacement has taken office (the "Succession Date").
     
Subject to Mr. Roelandts' signing the Company's standard form of general release and severance agreement in favor of the Company, and provided that (a) he remain employed as President and CEO until the Succession Date or (b) his employment is terminated for other than cause, but in either case, contingent upon the occurrence of the Succession Date, he will receive as soon as practicable following the Succession Date, a lump sum cash payment (less applicable withholding) equal to the sum of his current annual base salary and his annual bonus (which is equal to 90% of his annual base salary), for an aggregate payment of $1,482,000 (less applicable withholding).
     
In addition, Mr. Roelandts' employment with the Company will terminate on the Succession Date, upon which date he will be deemed to have resigned from all positions he may hold with the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries (other than his positions as a non-employee director and non-executive Chairman of our board), and will receive any earned and unpaid salary and accrued and unused vacation as well as a pro-rated portion of his target annual bonus. In addition, commencing on the Succession Date, the
Company will arrange to provide him and his spouse with continued medical and dental insurance benefits until the earlier of (a) his 65th birthday (whether or not he survives until that date) and (b) the date he becomes eligible under any other medical and dental plans, subject to his continuing to pay the same portion of the insurance premiums for these benefits as he paid during his employment with the Company.
     
On (or as soon as practicable following) the one year anniversary of the Succession Date, he will receive a bonus payment in the amount of $1,800,000 (less applicable withholding), but only if during that one year period he provides such satisfactory assistance and services as may reasonably be requested or otherwise required by the Company to ensure a smooth and successful transition to the positions of President and CEO.
     
During the period that Mr. Roelandts continues to serve as a non-employee member of our board, he will be entitled to: (a) continued vesting of his stock options; provided that upon termination of his service on our board, those of his then outstanding options that would have vested had he remained either employed by the Company or serving on our board until the one-year anniversary of his termination of service will become vested, and his vested options will remain exercisable pursuant to the terms of his option agreements and the applicable equity plans under which the options were granted; provided, however, that if he is prevented from exercising his options by reason of a blackout period, then each then outstanding option will remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the 60th day following the end of such blackout period, and (ii) the expiration of the term of such option; (b) an annual cash retainer equal to the amount paid to other board members for the applicable period of service; provided, however, that for so long as he continues to serve as Chairman of our board, he will be entitled to two times the annual cash retainer paid to other members of our board; and (c) equity awards, if any, granted at such time and in the same form and amount as the awards that are granted to other members of our board; provided, however, that he will not receive any equity award or other amount that is paid by reason of a director's first election or appointment to our board.

SAN JOSE, CA, OCTOBER 18, 2007
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $444.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, flat sequentially with the prior quarter and down 5% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter net income was $89.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.
The Xilinx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on December 5, 2007 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2007.
Additional second quarter comparisons are represented in the chart below:
GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
In spite of flat overall sales growth, sales from Asia Pacific reached record levels. Sales from Asia Pacific represented 30% of sales in the September quarter, up from 25% in the same quarter of the prior year and up from 13% in the same quarter five years ago. This growth is due to a combination of broad-based PLD adoption by customers within the region as well as the continuing trend by US and European companies to outsource manufacturing operations to the Asia Pacific region. Within Asia Pacific, sales from China and Korea recorded the strongest growth on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by increased activities in communications and consumer applications.
"I am pleased with our reduction in inventories as well as our continued operating expense control," said Wim Roelandts, Xilinx chief executive officer. "Combined inventory at Xilinx and distribution decreased by nine days to 92 days in the September quarter. This is lower than we had anticipated entering the quarter and the lowest level in nearly four years. Additionally, operating expenses were lower than forecast."
Business Review  September Quarter Fiscal 2008
Total inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 92 days, down from 101 days
last quarter.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 48, up from 43 in the prior quarter.
Capital expenditures and depreciation were $13 million and $14 million, respectively.
*Products are classified as follows:
New Products: Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-3, and CoolRunner II products Mainstream Products: Virtex-II, Spartan-II, CoolRunner and Virtex-E products Base Products: Virtex, Spartan, XC4000 and XC9500 products Support Products: Configuration solutions, HardWire, Software & Support/Services
-
Highlights September Quarter Fiscal 2008:
For the second consecutive quarter, Xilinx experienced strong sales from the domain optimized Virtex-4 FX family, which includes embedded transceiver and processing functionality. Sales from this family increased 170% in the second quarter versus the same quarter a year ago representing over 30% of the overall Virtex-4 family, up from 15% in the same quarter last year.  
Xilinx demonstrated its commitment to serving the high growth Asia Pacific market at the recent opening ceremonies for its new regional headquarters in Singapore. The headquarters provides infrastructure and support for all of Xilinx's activities in the region and includes facilities for research and development, marketing, manufacturing and testing, logistics warehousing and regional business operations. Xilinx is currently the largest PLD vendor in Asia Pacific, with 48% market segment share in CY2006.  
Xilinx received the Cisco Excellence in Delivery and Flexibility supplier appreciation award during the quarter. Xilinx was among an exclusive group of suppliers honored at Cisco's recent 16annual supplier appreciation day and received the award based on its support of Cisco's flexibility and lead-time requirements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     
 Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) today announced that Moshe Gavrielov, 53, has been appointed president and chief executive officer (CEO), succeeding Willem P. Roelandts, 63, who remains chairman of the board. Gavrielov becomes only the third Xilinx CEO in its 24-year history, and brings nearly 30 years of executive management and engineering experience with semiconductor and software companies to Xilinx. Gavrielov's appointment is effective immediately.
SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 7, 2008
Most recently, Gavrielov served as executive vice president and general manager of the fast-growing verification division at Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Before that, Gavrielov spent seven years as CEO of Verisity Ltd., where he grew the company from a $4M start-up, taking it through its initial public offering (IPO) in 2001 to a $70M publicly-traded company, and ultimately to its acquisition by electronic design automation leader Cadence in 2005.
     
"Moshe has an excellent track record in building semiconductor and software businesses, applying an outstanding blend of strategic, analytic, business and leadership skills," said Chairman Roelandts. "Equally important is his commitment to a culture of innovation that honors the contributions of each and every employee, in keeping with the core values upon which Xilinx has been built over the past 24 years. Moshe's selection was approved unanimously by our board of directors, and we're fully confident that he is the right person to lead Xilinx through its next stage of growth."
     
 "I'm honored and excited to assume responsibility from Wim for leading one of the most highly-respected semiconductor companies in the world," said Gavrielov. "We have a great opportunity to bring the benefits of Xilinx technology to a broader range of industries and applications in the coming years, building upon a solid foundation of technology innovation and market leadership. I look forward to working closely with our employees and partners to continue delivering unique value to an expanded set of customers, fulfilling the Xilinx vision to put a programmable solution into every electronic system."
     
Prior to joining Verisity, then Cadence, Gavrielov spent nearly ten years at LSI Logic Corp., where he served in a variety of executive management positions, including executive vice president for the $1.3B products group, senior vice president of international markets, general manager for Europe, and general manager of the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) division. Gavrielov began his career in engineering and engineering management at National Semiconductor and Digital Equipment. Gavrielov earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's degree in computer science from the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) in Haifa, Israel. He possesses five patents.
     
     
In his new role, Gavrielov succeeds one of the most highly respected CEOs in the industry. Roelandts was named president and CEO of Xilinx in 1996 after a 30-year management career at Hewlett-Packard Co. Just before joining Xilinx, he served as senior vice president responsible for all aspects of HP's then $6 billion worldwide computer systems business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, professional services and sales.
     Over more than a decade, Roelandts has led Xilinx through an intense period of change within the semiconductor industry, growing the company's sales from $560 million to over $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2007. During his tenure, Roelandts significantly expanded the company's global business and initiated its successful market diversification strategy to better address high-growth end markets, including consumer, automotive, industrial and defense. These markets have grown from 12 percent of total revenues in fiscal year 2002 to 45 percent of total revenues today.
      Under Roelandt's leadership, Xilinx was recognized by FORTUNE Magazine for its culture of innovation and management philosophy committed to addressing difficult economic times without resorting to layoffs. Notably, Xilinx ranked in the top 10 of FORTUNE's annual listing of "100 Best Companies to Work For" from 2002 to 2005, among America's elite corporations.
     
Since 2004, Roelandts has served on the board of directors for Applied Materials, Inc. For more than four years, Roelandts served as chairman of the board of the Fabless Semiconductor Association (FSA), where he played an instrumental role in the organization's growth and global expansion. During his tenure, FSA membership grew to nearly 500 and the organization expanded its reach into Asia and Europe. In November 2007, Roelandts assumed the post of chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

AGREEMENT OF MOSHE GAVRIELOV
By signing below, I acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to review this Separation Agreement carefully, I understand each and every term contained in this Separation Agreement and I voluntarily agree to them.
The following confirms the following agreement between me and XILINX __________
[insert legal entity name of local employer]
, a __________
[describe Xilinx organizational entity]
(the "Company") which is a material part of the consideration for my employment by the Company:
A. I understand that the Company possesses Proprietary Information that is important to its business and the business of its Affiliates. For purposes of this agreement "Affiliates" include any legal entity that controls or is controlled by the Company or is under common control with the Company. "Proprietary Information" is information that was developed, created, or discovered by the Company and/or its Affiliates, or which became known by, or was conveyed to the Company and/or its Affiliates, and which has commercial value in the business of the Company and its Affiliates. "Proprietary Information" includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, copyrightable subject matter, mask works, discoveries, ideas, techniques, know-how, confidential information, inventions (whether patentable or not), and/or any other information of any type relating to designs, configurations, toolings, documentation, recorded data, schematics, source code, object code, master works, master databases, algorithms, flow charts, formulae, circuits, works of authorship, mechanisms, research, manufacture, improvements, assembly, installation, marketing, forecasts, pricing, customers, the salaries, duties, qualifications, performance levels, and terms of compensation of other employees, and/or cost or other financial data concerning any of the foregoing or the Company and its Affiliates and their operations generally. I understand that my employment creates a relationship of confidence and trust between me and the Company with respect to Proprietary Information.
B. I understand that the Company possesses "Company Documents" which are important to its business and the business of its Affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Documents" are documents or other media that contain Proprietary Information or any other information concerning the business, operations or plans of the Company and/or its Affiliates, whether such documents have been prepared by me or by others. Company Documents include, but are not limited to, blueprints, drawings, photographs, charts, graphs, notebooks, customer list, computer disks, tapes or printouts, sound recordings and other printed, typewritten or handwritten documents.
C. I understand that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties confidential or proprietary information of such third parties ("Third Party Information") subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use it only for certain limited purposes.
D. In consideration of my employment by the Company and the compensation received by me from the Company from time to time, I hereby agree as follows:
     
1. All Proprietary Information and all patents, copyrights and other rights in connection therewith shall be the sole property of the Company. I hereby assign to the Company any rights I may have or acquire in such Proprietary Information.
At all times both during my employment by the Company and after termination of such employment, I will keep in confidence and trust and will not use, disclose, lecture upon, or publish any Proprietary Information or anything relating to it without the prior written consent of an officer of the Company, except as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing my duties to the Company. At all times both during my employment by the Company and after termination of such employment, I will keep in confidence and trust and will not use or disclose any Third Party Information, except as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing my duties to the Company, unless expressly authorized by an officer of the Company in writing. Nothing contained herein will prohibit an employee from disclosing to anyone the amount of his other wages.
     
2. All Company Documents shall be the sole property of the Company. I agree that during my employment by the Company, I will not remove any Company Documents from the business premises of the Company or deliver any Company Documents to any person or entity outside the Company, except as I am required to do in connection with performing the duties of my employment. I further agree that, immediately upon the termination of my employment by me or by the Company for any reason, or during my employment if so requested by the Company, I will return all Company Documents, apparatus, equipment and other physical property, or any reproduction of such property regardless in the form so made, excepting only (i) my personal copies of records relating to my compensation; (ii) my personal copies of any materials previously distributed generally to stockholders of the Company; and (iii) my copy of this Agreement. I further agree that in the event of my termination for any reason, I agree to sign and deliver the "Termination Certification" attached hereto as Exhibit A and/or any other termination statement reasonably required by the Company.
     
3. I will promptly disclose in writing to my immediate supervisor, with a copy to the Director of Intellectual Property for Xilinx, Inc., or to any persons designated by the Company, all "Inventions", which includes all improvements, inventions, works of authorship, mask works, computer programs, formulae, ideas, processes, techniques, know-how and data, whether or not patentable, made or conceived or reduced to practice or developed by me, either alone or jointly with others, during the term of my employment. I will also disclose to my immediate supervisor and the Vice President of Intellectual Property for Xilinx, Inc. all things that would be Inventions if made during the term of my employment, conceived, reduced to practice, or developed by me within six (6) months of the termination of my employment with the Company. Such disclosures shall be received by the Company in confidence and do not extend the assignment made in Section 4 below. I will not disclose Inventions to any person outside the Company or its Affiliates unless I am permitted or authorized to do so by the Vice President of Intellectual Property for Xilinx, Inc.
     
4. I agree that all Inventions which I make, conceive, reduce to practice or develop (in whole or in part, either alone or jointly with others) during my employment shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B, and I hereby assign such Inventions and all rights therein to the Company. No assignment in this Agreement shall extend to inventions, the assignment of which is prohibited by Labor Code section 2870. The Company shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights and other intellectual property or other rights in connection therewith. I acknowledge that all original works of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of my employment and which are protectable by copyright are "works made for hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C., Section 101).
     
5. I agree to perform, during and after my employment, all acts deemed necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at the Company's expense (excluding payment for time spent reviewing documents or assisting the Company), in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents, copyrights or other rights on such Inventions and improvements in any and all countries. Such acts may include, but are not limited to, execution of documents and assistance or cooperation in legal proceedings. I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents, as my agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for and in my behalf and instead of me, to execute and file any documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the above purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. I hereby waive, quitclaim and assign to the Company in perpetuity any and all moral rights, rights of attribution or other claims, of any nature whatsoever, which I now or may hereafter have for infringement of any rights assigned hereunder to the Company.
     
6. I have attached hereto as Exhibit C a complete list of all Inventions to which I claim ownership and that I desire to remove from the operation of this Agreement, and I acknowledge and agree that such list is complete. If no such lists attached to this Agreement, I represent that I have no such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement. If disclosure of any such Invention would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am not to list such Inventions in Exhibit C, but am to inform the Company that all such Inventions have not been listed for that reason.
     
7. During the term of my employment and for one (1) year thereafter, I will not encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for any reason. However, this obligation shall not affect any responsibility I may have as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel.
In addition, I agree that during the term of my employment and for one (1) year thereafter, I will not do anything which would in any manner disrupt, undermine or impair the Company's contractual relationships with any of its customers or suppliers.
     
8. I agree that during my employment with the Company I will not engage in any employment, business, or activity that is in any way competitive with the business or proposed business of the Company and I will not assist any other person or organization in competing with the Company or in preparing to engage in competition with the business or proposed business of the Company. The provisions of this Section shall apply both during normal working hours and at all other times including, but not limited to, nights, weekends and vacation time, while I am employed by the Company.
     
9. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company. I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith or in conflict with my employment with the Company.
    
10. In compliance with the United States Department of Commerce Export
Administration Regulations (the "Regulations"), I agree that I will not knowingly export/re-export the technology for the design, development or production of Xilinx' integrated circuits, or export/re-export the direct product of this technology directly or indirectly to any denied party, restricted or embargoed country identified in the US regulations.
Further, in compliance with U.S. laws/regulations (EAR 740.6), I agree that without a Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) license or License Exception, I will not:

H. Because my services are personal and unique and because I may have access to and become acquainted with the Proprietary Information of the Company, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without bond, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.

2870.
(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:

Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
Ongoing efforts to improve operating margin and capital structure paid off in fiscal 2008. Operating margin was 23% in fiscal 2008, up from 19% in the prior fiscal year as a result of gross margin expansion coupled with expense reduction efforts. Annual return on equity was 22% in fiscal 2008, up from 16% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to improved operating efficiency and capital structure. During the fiscal year, Xilinx repurchased 24 million shares of common stock and announced an increase in its dividend to $0.14 per diluted share, resulting in a dividend yield of 2.4%, higher than the dividend yield of the S&P 500.
  
Xilinx improved its 65nm sales leadership with strong growth from its Virtex-5 FPGA family. Shipping over a year before competing products, sales from the
  
Virtex-5 family increased more than 70% sequentially in the March quarter. Recently, Xilinx introduced Virtex-5 FXT devices which deliver in system integration for designs that demand high-performance processing and high-speed serial I/Os, enabling designers to reduce system costs, board space and component count. Xilinx estimates that it currently supplies over 90% of the PLD industry's 65nm sales.
Xilinx delivered the ISE Design Suite10.1, a single unified release providing FPGA logic, embedded and DSP designers with immediate access to the Company's entire line of design tools with full interoperability. The ISE Design Suite offers significantly faster implementations with an average of 2X faster run-times and up to 38% faster performance.
  
Xilinx realized record sales in the Consumer & Automotive and Industrial and Other end markets in fiscal 2008. These combined categories represented 49% of sales in fiscal 2008, up from 45% in the prior fiscal year and up from 36% three years ago. Growth in these end markets was primarily driven by strength in defense and automotive applications and validates the Company's focused end market diversification efforts.

2009 Executive Incentive Plan
On April 30, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2009 (the "2009 Incentive Plan"). The 2009 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of its financial and strategic objectives. The 2009 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2009, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 100% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 60% to 85% of their respective base salaries.
     
Plan Components
Under the 2009 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using four components, each with a weighting of 25%. The four components are: (1) the Company's revenue growth (the "Growth Component"); (2) the Company's share of revenue (the "SOR Component"); (3) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "OP Component"); and (4) strategic objective goals pertaining to such officer's position and responsibilities (the "Strategic Component").
     
Growth Component
The Growth Component is paid annually and is designed to reward year-over-year revenue growth. The Growth Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout as the revenue growth increases. The Growth Component multiplier increases by 0.2 for each percentage of revenue growth and is capped at an annual maximum of 2.0.
     
SOR Component
The SOR Component is paid annually and is designed to measure and reward increases in the Company's share of revenue as compared to benchmark programmable logic device companies identified by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The SOR Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The SOR Component multiplier is 0.5 if the initial threshold is reached, increases by increments of 0.125 and is capped at an annual maximum of 2.0.
     
OP Component
The OP Component is paid semi-annually and is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit on a semi-annual basis, with the objective increasing in difficulty. For the OP Component, each measured increase above a quarterly operating profit percentage target is subject to a multiplier of 0.5 and is capped at a maximum of 2.0. At the discretion of the Compensation
Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charge may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component
.
     
Strategic Component
The Strategic Component is paid semi-annually and is based on a maximum of five strategic goals for each half of the year. The minimum weighting of any one individual goal is 20% and achievement of each goal is measured at 0%, 50%, 100% and 150%. The threshold for any payout of the Strategic Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance is capped at 150%.
The Incentive Plan is effective as of April 1, 2008 and bonus payments will be made in November 2008 in connection with the Company's performance in the first half of fiscal 2009.

GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
Sales from all geographies except North America were up sequentially in the September quarter. Total international sales increased 2% sequentially representing a record 66% of total sales in the quarter, up from 62% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline in sales from North America was primarily due to weakening sales from defense and wired communications applications.
Operating income for the September quarter was $124.6 million representing 25.8% of net revenues. This was the highest operating margin reported by Xilinx in nearly three years and a direct result of continued expense controls.
"Sales growth from our industry's leading Virtex-5 family was the highlight of the quarter," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "Virtex-5 FPGA sales increased over 40% sequentially during the quarter representing over 10% of total sales, up from 2% in the same quarter of the prior year. Sales from this family were driven by a broad base of applications with particularly strong growth coming from next generation wireless activity in China."

Operating margin of 26.1% is highest reported in three years
Virtex-5 sales post strong growth
SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 14, 2009
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced net revenues of $458.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, down 5% sequentially from the prior quarter and down 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter net income was $139.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, including an $89.7 million pre-tax gain on the early extinguishment of convertible debentures and a $19.5 million pre-tax impairment charge on investments. Collectively, these income and expense items represented approximately $0.19 per diluted share after tax.
The Xilinx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on February 25, 2009 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 4, 2009.
Additional third quarter comparisons are represented in the charts below:
GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
Sales in the month of December were particularly weak as the current economic recessionary environment began impacting customers in most Xilinx end markets. With the exception of sales to Industrial and Other which were flat, sales to other end markets declined sequentially in the December quarter.
Continued cost reduction efforts contributed to improved gross and operating margins during the quarter. Operating margin of 26.1% was up from 24.3% in the same quarter of the prior year and the highest reported in over three years. Gross margin of 63.9% was up from 63.3% in the same quarter of the prior year and the highest reported in over four years.
"Sales from the Company's flagship Virtex-5 family posted exceptionally strong growth in the December quarter increasing 35% sequentially and representing 15% of total sales, up from 10% in the prior quarter." said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "The success of this product family in today's challenging economic environment underscores a growing affinity for programmable solutions versus ASIC alternatives. Programmable solutions provide customers with lower risk, greater flexibility and, in many cases, lower total overall cost."
*Products are classified as follows:
New Products: Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-3, and CoolRunner-II products Mainstream Products: Virtex-II, Spartan-II, CoolRunner and Virtex-E products Base Products: Virtex, Spartan, XC4000 and XC9500 products Support Products: Configuration solutions, HardWire, Software & Support/Services
Highlights  December Quarter Fiscal 2009
For the second consecutive quarter, sales to customers in wireless communications were particularly strong, increasing over 10% sequentially. Most of this growth was attributable to the next generation rollout of wireless technologies in China. Xilinx FPGA solutions, most notably Virtex-5 FPGAs, are key beneficiaries of this next generation wireless technology rollout due to their high performance, functionality and system integration capabilities.
Xilinx continues to have one of the most stable and resilient business models in the technology industry in terms of profitability and cash flow generation. In the December quarter, Xilinx generated $128.5 million in operating cash flow and paid $146.3 million in cash to repurchase $241.1 million (principal amount) of convertible debentures and $38.4 million in cash dividends. Xilinx currently has among the highest dividend yields in the technology industry.
     *Return on equity calculation: Annualized net income/average stockholders' equity
Business Outlook  March Quarter Fiscal 2009
Sales are expected to be down 15% to 25% sequentially.
Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 61% to 63%.
Operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down sequentially from the December quarter.
Interest and other is expected to be a net expense of $3 million.

This includes full disclosure of any actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest. Although it would not be possible to describe every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise, the following are examples of actions that may constitute a conflict of interest if taken by employees or their family members:
Providing, accepting or soliciting bribes, kick-backs or other incentives designed to influence one's judgment on behalf of Xilinx.

Officers must obtain the prior approval of the Audit Committee. Such an opportunity should be considered an investment opportunity for Xilinx in the first instance.
Directors of Xilinx are subject to the Director Code of Ethics. The Conflict of Interest Policy of the Director Code of Ethics applies to Directors of Xilinx in lieu of the foregoing.

The Code In Action
The situation
: A Field Application Engineer's wife is employed by a distributor for Xilinx. Is the FAE required to disclose this relationship?
The action
: No, the FAE is not required to disclose the employer of his wife unless his job requires him to deal directly with his wife or her department or he owns a substantial interest in his wife's employer.
The situation
: A senior manager's wife owns an office supply firm with lower prices than any other office supply firm. Should the senior manager instruct his administrative assistant to order supplies from his wife's company?
The action
: No, not unless the senior manager went through the normal vendor approval process and disclosed the relationship to the appropriate parties, including his manager and the Finance department.
The situation
: If the manager instructs his administrative assistant to order the supplies without going through the normal vendor approval process and disclosing the relationship to the appropriate parties, should the administrative assistant report her manager?
The action
: Yes, absolutely. The administrative assistant may report this to her manager's manager, HR or the Legal Department. Alternatively, the matter may be reported anonymously through the use of the anonymous reporting system, found online at
www.MySafeWorkplace.com
, or by dialing one of the following numbers without charge: Toll free US: 1-800-335-7639; Toll free Ireland: 00 800 1777 9999; International Collect: 720-514-440.
The situation

The situation
: Xilinx is in discussions with a potential supplier about a new business arrangement when the supplier offers to take several executives to the upcoming Super Bowl where they can continue their meetings. Can the executives attend the Super Bowl at the supplier's invitation?

4.
OUR FINANCIAL RECORDS AND PUBLIC REPORTING
As a publicly traded company, it is of critical importance that the reports and information Xilinx files with, or submits to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies be complete, accurate, timely and understandable. We must all take this responsibility very seriously and provide information that is accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents Xilinx files with, or submits to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies and in other public communications. These documents form the basis for managing our business and fulfilling our obligations to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and the regulatory authorities. Any records required by your job at Xilinx, such as time cards, expense reports, customer billing, sales reports and the like must be timely, accurate and complete. If you become aware of records that may be inaccurate, report the situation immediately. Xilinx strictly forbids the preparation of false records for any purpose.
In addition to this Code, Xilinx Finance personnel must comply with the Financial Executives International Code of Ethics, attached as Appendix A to this Code.
The Code In Action
The situation
: A customer demanded that a salesperson agree to provide his company with future discounts on future products in return for a current order at a price approved by Xilinx management.

The action
: Not unless the future discounts are approved by Business Operations and made known to the Finance Department and Legal Department. If management is not aware of the arrangement, it is a "side agreement" and is strictly prohibited by Xilinx policy and the Code. Refer to the Xilinx Pricing Policy for more information on this topic.
The situation
: A vendor demands that a department manager agree in an email to pay the vendor in advance for products to be delivered in the following quarter. Should the manager agree to these terms without further action?
6
The action
: No. The manager must contact Purchasing and a purchase order, or P.O., must be issued so that the books and records of Xilinx accurately reflect its financial commitments. Failing to properly record expenses violates the Code and company policy.
The situation
: Two employees on a business trip shared a meal at a restaurant. One employee paid for the meal and was reimbursed for the expense. Can the other employee submit a duplicate receipt for the same expense since he was also at the meal?
The action
: No. Submitting a duplicate receipt would be an attempt to defraud Xilinx since the company already paid for the meal when it reimbursed the first employee.
The situation
: An administrative assistant books travel for several executives. In return for selecting a particular hotel chain for the executives' travel, the administrative assistant is offered customer reward "points" by the hotel chain. Since he booked the trips, can he accept the points?
The action
: No. He should refuse to accept the points personally since they were not awarded in connection with his own business travel on behalf of Xilinx.

WE PROTECT OUR COMPANY ASSETS AND INFORMATION
Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets
We must all take care to protect the assets of Xilinx and to use them appropriately. The assets of Xilinx come in many forms:
Intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights;
Confidential information, including financial information, technical information, strategic plans and product plans;
Physical assets, including equipment, computers and software; and
Your time and work product.
Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on Xilinx profitability. We should take measures to prevent damage to or theft or misuse of Xilinx property. Except as specifically authorized, Xilinx assets, including Xilinx time, equipment, materials, resources and proprietary information, must be used for business purposes only. Occasional and reasonable personal use of certain Xilinx equipment is permitted. Refer to the Email Etiquette and Computer Usage Policy for more information on this topic.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An executive asks his administrative assistant to run his personal errands, such as picking up his dry cleaning and shopping for gifts, on company time. Should the administrative assistant agree to conduct the executive's personal business on Xilinx time?
7
The action
: No. The administrative assistant's time is the company's asset, and must be used to fulfill her work responsibilities. By asking her to attend to his personal affairs, the senior director was misusing company assets, violating company policy and violating the Code.
The situation:
In the example above, should the administrative assistant report the situation to HR?
The action:
Yes. The administrative assistant may also report the matter to her manager's manager or the Legal Department. Alternatively, the matter may be reported anonymously through the use of the anonymous reporting system, found online at
www.MySafeWorkplace.com
, or by dialing one of the following numbers without charge: Toll free US: 1-800-335-7639; Toll free Ireland: 00 800 1777 9999; International Collect: 720-514-440.
The situation
: An executive is traveling on company business in Europe and purchases gifts for her children while abroad. The executive does not want to carry the items during the rest of her trip. Should she ask the country manager to send the goods back through the company's shipping department?
The action
: No. This would be a misuse of Xilinx assets. Company policy forbids using interoffice mail or shipping for the delivery of personal goods. The executive should make other arrangements with a commercial carrier and pay for the expense out of her own pocket.
Confidential Information
All employees may learn, to a greater or lesser degree, facts about Xilinx business, plans, operations or "secrets of success" that are not known to the general public or to competitors. Sensitive information such as customer data, the terms offered or prices charged to particular customers, strategic plans, next generation product specifications and production techniques are examples of Xilinx confidential information or trade secrets. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to Xilinx or its customers, if disclosed. During the course of performing your responsibilities, you may obtain information concerning possible transactions with other companies or receive confidential information concerning other companies, such as our customers, which the company may be under an obligation to maintain as confidential.
You must maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to you by Xilinx or its customers, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Employees who possess or have access to confidential information or trade secrets must:
Not use the information for their own benefit or the benefit of persons inside or outside of Xilinx.
Carefully guard against disclosure of that information to people outside Xilinx. For example, you should not discuss such matters with family members or business or social acquaintances or in places where the information may be overheard, such as taxis, public transportation, elevators or restaurants.
Not disclose confidential information to another Xilinx employee unless the employee needs the information to carry out business responsibilities.
8
Non-Disclosure Agreements, or NDAs, are commonly used when Xilinx needs to protect confidential information to be disclosed to suppliers, consultants, joint venture participants, customers or others. An NDA puts the person receiving confidential information on notice that he or she must maintain the secrecy of such information. Xilinx intellectual property and other confidential information may not be disclosed or used outside of Xilinx prior to the execution of an agreement approved by the Legal Department, typically either an NDA or a license agreement, depending on the circumstances. For more information on this topic, consult the Legal Department.
Your obligation to treat information as confidential does not end when you leave Xilinx. Upon the termination of your employment, you must return everything that belongs to Xilinx, including all documents and other materials containing Xilinx and customer confidential information. You must not disclose confidential information received in the course of your employment at Xilinx to a new employer or to others after ceasing to be a Xilinx employee.
You may not disclose your previous employer's confidential information to Xilinx. However, you may use general skills and knowledge acquired during your previous employment.
Refer to your Proprietary Rights and Inventions Agreement, the Xilinx Proprietary Information Policy, Document Classification Policy and Copyright Policy for more information on treatment of confidential information.
The Code In Action
The situation:
A salesperson is in discussions with a potential new customer, and the customer asks for next generation product specifications and technical data. Should the salesperson immediately send the requested information?
The action
: Only if the salesperson already has a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) approved by the Legal Department in place with the potential customer. If there is no NDA, sending the information would compromise the assets of Xilinx, violate company policy and the Code.
The situation:
An employee is at a BBQ with friends and the conversation turns to a rumor circulating the Internet that Xilinx is entering into a new joint venture. Can the employee discuss the matter since it is already circulating the Internet?
The action
: No. The information is not considered public until it is officially announced by Xilinx to persons outside of Xilinx. The employee should avoid any further comment on the subject.
The situation
: An employee participates in an industry chat room and reads some disparaging comments about Xilinx future prospects. The employee is very excited about the new product offering at Xilinx that he is working on and thinks the information in the chat room is incorrect. Should the employee rebut to the negative postings about Xilinx?
9
The action
: No. Discussing Xilinx confidential business information on blogs and in chatrooms in this manner is prohibited. Refer to the Xilinx Written Disclosure Policy for more information on this topic.
Insider Trading
Every employee of Xilinx is required to safeguard Xilinx material nonpublic information. Material nonpublic information is important information about the company that could impact our stock price but that has not yet been disclosed to the public. Examples of material nonpublic information include:
Financial information;
Technical information;
Undisclosed strategic plans and next generation product plans;
Information regarding acquisitions or mergers;
Information about major contracts or transactions;
Management changes; and
Other significant corporate developments.
Trading in stocks or other securities based on material nonpublic information, or providing such information to others who then trade on such information, is illegal and may result in criminal prosecution. This prohibition also applies to securities of other companies, such as the customers and suppliers of Xilinx, if you learn material nonpublic information about such companies in the course of your duties for Xilinx. All employees are required to comply with the company's Insider Trading Policy. In addition, directors, officers and certain employees are required to comply with the Trading Policy for Section 16 Officers, Directors and Designated Employees. All questions on this subject should be directed to the Legal Department.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An employee has to pay her property taxes and she wants to sell her Xilinx ESPP shares to make the payment. The employee knows the financial results of Xilinx for the quarter, but the results have not been announced. Should the employee go ahead and sell her ESPP shares since the reason she is selling the shares is to pay her taxes?
The action
: No. Because she knows the company's financial results and results have not been announced, she is in possession of material nonpublic information, and she cannot trade in Xilinx stock, even if the reason for selling the stock is not based on that information. Mere possession of the material nonpublic information while trading will result in a securities law violation. Employees should consult the Legal Department if they have any questions about trading in Xilinx stock.
The situation
: An employee is in discussions with a publicly traded supplier about a contract renewal and the supplier tells the employee that he should get the contract renewal done "asap" because they are about to be acquired and all of their pricing terms will change. Can the employee purchase shares of the supplier in anticipation of the jump in price after the acquisition is announced?
The action
: No. When the employee learned of the supplier's acquisition, he came into possession of material nonpublic information about the supplier. In addition to violating the Xilinx Insider Trading Policy and this Code, trading on such information would be a violation of the securities laws, and would subject the employee to criminal and civil penalties.
10
The situation:
An employee is fishing with his father-in-law, who says he has heard good things about Xilinx and asks if Xilinx is a "hot stock" and whether he should buy it. The employee knows an important announcement about Xilinx has not yet been made. Should he tell his father-in-law since he is family?
The action:
No. If he does and his father-in-law decides to trade in the stock they could both be prosecuted under the insider trading laws, the employee as the "tipper" and his father-in-law, as the "tippee". The employee should not share material nonpublic information about the company or the stock, even with family members.
Response to Inquiries from the Media and Others
Only specific persons and departments are authorized to communicate about Xilinx with the media and financial community about Xilinx. All inquiries from the financial media, market research firms and investors and inquiries about financial or investor matters should be referred to Investor Relations. All other inquiries from the media should be referred to Public Relations. Inquiries from regulators or governmental entities should be referred to the Legal Department.
Consult the Communications Policy and Written Disclosure Policy for more information on this topic.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An independent research firm contacts an employee asking him to act as a paid consultant to provide the firm with industry related information based on his experience at Xilinx. Can the employee agree to be a consultant?
The action
: No. Providing company information and participating in these paid consulting opportunities is a violation of the Code and the Xilinx Communications Policy. The employee should decline the offer and notify Investor Relations of the request.
The situation
: A marketing manager is contacted by a financial journal about recent Xilinx financial forecasts. Can the manager provide information that he received from the Finance Department?
The action
: No. Investor Relations handles all inquiries from financial media and investors.
6. HOW WE DO BUSINESS
Xilinx depends on its reputation for excellence, quality and integrity. How we deal with customers, suppliers, and competitors builds our reputation, builds trust and determines our success.
11
Fair Dealing
You should always endeavor to deal fairly with Xilinx's customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. Xilinx employees are prohibited from taking unfair advantage of others through manipulation, concealment, abuse of information, misrepresentation or any other unfair business practice.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An employee's friend is fired from a key competitor. The friend is angry about his termination and decides to give the competitor's confidential information to his friend at Xilinx to harm the competitor. Can the Xilinx employee accept the confidential information?
The action
: No. The Legal Department should be notified in such circumstances so that Xilinx can alert the competitor of the breach.
The situation
: The engineering department is gathering information about a competitor's new product on the market and wants to purchase some of the product to study it. Can the department engage a third party to purchase the products on behalf of Xilinx if it follows company procedure to pay for the product and services?
The action
: Yes. Gathering information about a competitor and their products, including purchasing a competitor's product, is acceptable as long as it is done in a lawful and honest manner and in accordance with Xilinx policy.
Antitrust
The antitrust laws of the United States and similar laws around the world are designed to foster a free and competitive marketplace. The spirit of our business ethics and the letter of the law require that Xilinx fully comply with the antitrust laws throughout the world. To comply with antitrust laws, we must
not
:
Communicate with any competitor relating to price, any factor relating to price, production levels or customer terms and conditions;
Divide or allocate markets or customers;
Agree to boycott another business;
Place inappropriate conditions on purchases or sales the purpose of which is to engage in anti-competitive behavior; or
Otherwise impair our, or any competitor's independence in conducting business in our markets.
All of these activities are strictly forbidden at Xilinx, without regard to whether they are made orally or in writing or whether or not they are the subject of express agreements. In addition, Xilinx avoids conduct that may even give the appearance of being anti-competitive, and you should be aware that any action or communication may be subject to later scrutiny. Keep in mind that in certain conditions, a distributor or other party with whom you deal may be viewed as a competitor.
12
Trade shows or industry association meetings may create the potential for, or the appearance of, improper conduct, although they have many legitimate purposes. If you plan to attend a meeting with a party that may be considered a competitor of Xilinx or at which competitively sensitive topics may be discussed, or you have questions about a particular activity or practice, consult the Legal Department immediately.
The Code In Action
The situation
: A salesperson in a Xilinx worldwide location runs into the sales rep of a key competitor at a social function and the two agree to have lunch. At lunch, the competitor's sales rep suggests that the two agree to "stay out of each other's way" at certain customers. The salesperson knows that what is being proposed is anticompetitive behavior but doesn't want to be rude. What should he do?
The action
: The salesperson should immediately terminate the conversation, excuse himself from lunch and notify his manager and the Legal Department of the incident. Illegal agreements with competitors do not need to be written or even involve express commitments. Illegal agreements can be based on informal discussions and the exchange of information between competitors. Xilinx employees should avoid situations and discussions where an illegal agreement could be inferred.
The situation
: An employee in the marketing department is asked to participate in an industry association conference but is concerned about what she is able and unable to say while in a meeting since the competitors of Xilinx will also be in attendance. Can she attend the conference?
The action
: The employee and her manager should consult the Legal Department to discuss the matter. If it is determined advisable for her to attend, the Legal Department will coach her on the permissible and prohibited areas of discussion, as well as the rules on how to excuse herself from the meeting if the discussion veers into anticompetitive topics.
Global Trade
In every country in which Xilinx does business, laws and regulations govern imports and exports. Many of these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit physical shipment of Xilinx products, or the transfer or electronic transmission of technology to certain destinations, entities and foreign persons. In many instances, an export license or other government approval is required by law before an item may be shipped or transferred. In some cases, Xilinx may be prohibited from entering into any transaction whatsoever (whether direct or indirect) with certain persons.
It is the policy of Xilinx to comply with all U.S. Customs regulations. Therefore, all declarations regarding the valuation, classification and country of origin of imported goods must be accurate. Employees must contact the Global Trade Compliance team for assistance to ensure such declarations are accurate.
In order to comply with these laws, we must clear all goods through customs and must not:
Transfer controlled technology unless we have obtained an approved export license or can demonstrate the use of an applicable exemption;
Apply an inappropriate monetary value to goods and services; or
Proceed with a transaction if we know a violation has occurred or is about to occur.
13
These laws are extremely complex and subject to frequent change. In addition to consequences to Xilinx, individuals who violate these laws may be subject to criminal or civil penalties. Refer to the Xilinx Export Compliance Program for more information and consult the Global Trade Compliance team for assistance.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An employee receives a request for technical product information from a potential customer in China. Can he go ahead and send the information requested?
The action
: Depending on the type of information requested, a license may be required. The employee should notify the Global Trade Compliance Group for assistance. If a license is required and the company sent the information to China without the appropriate license, it would be in violation of the law and Xilinx would be required to make a voluntary disclosure to the authorities regarding the violation and pay a substantial penalty.
The situation
: An engineering group wants to make an offer of employment to a Ph.D. student at a major U.S. university. The student is a citizen of Libya. Since the candidate is already in the U.S., can Xilinx go ahead and make the offer?
The action
: No. Because the student is a citizen of a country restricted for national security reasons, a license is required before hiring him to handle technical data. The Legal Department must approve all requests to file for a license.
The situation:
An employee needs to ship supplies from one office to another. Should the employee undervalue the items to be shipped so the company does not have to pay as much in applicable fees?
The action:
No. It is a federal offense not to provide accurate information in a customs declaration. The employee should consult Global Trade Compliance team for assistance to ensure the correct information is provided on the declaration.
Anti-Corruption
Xilinx officers, employees, contractors and agents may never, under any circumstances, provide anything of value, including but not limited to, money, bribes, kickbacks, gifts or entertainment of any kind to a public sector or governmental official of any public body or governmental agency or organization of any country, including the U.S, in connection with Xilinx business. Indirect payments through agents, contractors or other third parties are also prohibited. In addition, Xilinx employee are strictly prohibited from using the services of a company, organization or individual connected to a public sector or government official at his or her request, if such use would result in a benefit to the official. This prohibition extends to government employees and officials, candidates for political office, and employees of government controlled organizations and businesses. Giving anything of value to a public official or government employee in return for retaining or obtaining business is strictly prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as other national and international anti-corruption legislation, and will have serious consequences for Xilinx. Employees who violate this prohibition will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
14
The Code In Action
The situation
: An operations manager is seeking permits for a new building site in a foreign country. He would like to arrange to take several government officials out to an informal meal to discuss the company's plans. Can he proceed with this plan?
The action
: No. Providing gifts or entertainment of any kind, including meals, to government officials is a violation of the Code and the Xilinx Gift Policy.
The situation
: A salesperson is seeking to sell Xilinx products to a government agency of another country. After several meetings with the foreign official in charge of the project, the foreign official asks the salesperson to get in touch with his agent for payment details. What should the salesperson do in this situation?
The action
: She should take no further action and notify the Legal Department of the request. Payments to foreign officials, whether directly or through third parties violate the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The situation
: An employee attends a fundraiser for a local politician who pledges to support Silicon Valley interests in Washington D.C. The campaign manager asks the employee to pledge a donation on behalf of Xilinx. May the employee make such a donation since the politician's agenda is good for Xilinx?
The action:
No. The employee must decline and advise the campaign manager that Xilinx employees are not authorized to make political donations on behalf of Xilinx. The CEO and General Counsel must authorize all political contributions by Xilinx. However, employees are always free to make personal donations in their own names.
Confidential Information of Others
In addition to protecting our own intellectual property and confidential information, we respect the intellectual property rights and confidential information of others. Therefore, we must use the confidential information of others only if we have authorization to do so. We must not copy or reproduce protected material without authorization or license. In addition, we must never request or encourage anyone to use or disclose confidential information of a third party unless they have permission from that third party.
The Code In Action
The situation
: A prominent member of a competitor's executive team leaves the competitor and applies for a position at Xilinx. During the interview process, the executive intimates that he will bring the competitor's key data and technical information to Xilinx for the right price. What should the interviewer do?
15
The action
: The interviewer should notify Human Resources and the Legal Department and Xilinx must terminate its discussions with the executive. Obtaining information through illegal means violates the Code and may be anticompetitive. The executive revealed himself as someone who could not be trusted with confidential information and therefore has no place at Xilinx.
The situation
: An RFP is issued for certain consulting work. One of the possible vendors has a long standing relationship with Xilinx. The long term vendor's relationship is valuable to Xilinx. Can Xilinx contact the long term vendor and disclose the terms of the bids by the other vendors to see if the long term vendor can top them?
The action
: No. The company must not share the confidential information of its vendors or suppliers under any circumstances. In addition, providing such information in these circumstances would compromise the integrity of the RFP process.
Environment, Health and Safety
Xilinx is committed to the protection of the environment and to providing a safe and healthy workplace for the Xilinx community. Xilinx employees must comply with all laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and the health and safety of Xilinx employees and with additional internal environment, health and safety standards established by Xilinx. Xilinx employees should be familiar with and comply with safety regulations applicable to their work areas and internal standards.
The Code In Action
The situation
: An engineering team is hard at work on meeting a project deadline. The day the project is due, the fire alarm goes off in their building. It is a scheduled drill, but the manager instructs everyone to leave the building. Did he do the right thing?
The action
: Yes. Even when important deadlines are involved, Xilinx never compromises the health and safety of its employees. You can never be certain when there is a false or real alarm, so you must always follow emergency preparedness and health and safety procedures.
The situation
: An operations manager visits a testing facility that Xilinx is considering using in the future. The manager notes that the employees appear very young to be working and requests additional due diligence on the supplier's hiring practices and local laws. Was he wrong to do that since it isn't a Xilinx facility?
The action
: No. Xilinx expects its suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and seeks to hold its business partners to the same high standards it holds itself, as set forth in the Xilinx Code of Social Responsibility.
The situation
:
The Facilities department solicits several bids for some construction work at a Xilinx foreign office. One of the bids is significantly lower than the others and is accepted. Once work has begun on the project, the Facilities manager notices that the contractor does not supply the construction workers with basic safety equipment, such as safety goggles and hard hats. Should the manager mind his own business?
16
The action
: No. To protect the workers and Xilinx, the manager should raise his concerns about the health and safety of the workers and require the contractor to take immediate steps to provide its employees with the necessary safety equipment.
7.
WE RESPECT EACH OTHER
The way we treat each other and our work environment affects the way we do our jobs. All employees want and deserve a work place where they are respected. Everyone who works for Xilinx must contribute to the creation and maintenance of such an environment, and supervisors and managers have a special responsibility to foster a workplace that supports honesty, integrity, respect and trust.
Xilinx does not tolerate harassment of employees in the workplace or in a work-related situation, and harassment is a violation of this Code and of the CREATIVE values.
Unlawful harassment in employment can take many different forms, some examples are:
Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, threats, sexually explicit propositions or unwanted comments and jokes
Visual conduct such as derogatory and/or obscene posters, cartoons, drawings or gestures; and
Physical conduct such as blocking normal movement, restraining, touching or physically interfering with another.
Conduct which may be intended as harmless may be considered harassment if a recipient or onlooker perceives the conduct as offensive.
Refer to the Harassment Policy for more information on this topic.
The Code In Action
The situation
: A vice-president decides to put up replications of works of fine art in her office. Some of the paintings depict nude images. Was she wrong to hang these paintings?
The action
: No, but if the images make other employees uncomfortable, they should be removed. Employees should report their concerns about such matters to Human Resources.
The situation
: There is a profanity-laced video featuring a controversial comedian on the Internet that has gotten a lot of press. An employee sees it, and wants to circulate the link to his colleagues at work, because he knows they will enjoy the jokes. Can he do so?
The action
: No. In addition to containing profanity, the content could offend the sensibilities of a fellow employee, and could be grounds for a complaint against the company.
17
8.

-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) announced restructuring measures designed to drive structural operating efficiencies across the Company. The Company expects to reduce its global workforce by up to 200 positions, or 6%, resulting in a pre-tax charge of approximately $11 to $13 million in the June quarter primarily related to severance pay expenses. Additionally, Xilinx is implementing other short-term cost savings including executive salary reductions and a broad-based employee salary freeze. As a result, Xilinx expects to generate cost and operating expense savings of approximately $4 to $5 million per quarter beginning in the June quarter. Restructuring charges will not impact the recently ended March quarter.
SAN JOSE, CA, APRIL 15, 2009
Over the longer term, the Company expects to implement further supply chain efficiencies resulting in additional restructuring charges totaling approximately $10 million over the September, December and March quarters of fiscal 2010. These efficiencies are expected to result in changes to the structure and location of certain global operations, which are expected to provide the Company with further cost savings over time.
Xilinx is currently in its quiet period, so an update to its business outlook will not be provided at this time. Further information concerning savings and costs related to the restructuring will be provided when the company announces March quarter results on April 22, 2009. Please visit the company's web site at www.investor.xilinx.com for information relating to the real-time audio broadcast.

2010 Executive Incentive Plan
On April 28, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2010 (the "2010 Incentive Plan"). The 2010 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of its financial and strategic objectives. The 2010 Incentive Plan is effective as of April 1, 2009.
The 2010 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2010, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 100% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 60% to 75% of their respective base salaries, depending on their seniority. For purposes of calculating the executive bonuses under the 2010 Incentive Plan, the executives' base salaries in effect prior to the temporary salary reductions announced by the Company in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 15, 2009, shall apply.
     
Plan Components
Under the 2010 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using three different components, each with different weighting. The three components are: (1) the Company's share of revenue (the "SOR Component"), weighted at 20%; (2) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "OP Component"), weighted at 30%; and (3) strategic objective goals pertaining to each officer's position and responsibilities (the "Strategic Component"), weighted at 50%. All components are paid on a semi-annual basis.
     
SOR Component
The SOR Component is designed to measure and reward increases in the Company's share of revenue as compared to benchmark programmable logic device companies identified by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The SOR Component is subject to a minimum threshold for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. The SOR Component multiplier is 50% if the minimum threshold percentage is reached and 100% if the target percentage is reached. After the target percentage is reached, the multiplier increases by increments of 25%, and is capped at a maximum of 200%.
     
OP Component
The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit. The OP Component is subject to a minimum threshold range for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. For the OP Component, the threshold range of operating profit percentages is subject to a multiplier of 20%, and the multiplier increases by increments of 10% after the top of the threshold range is met. If the target range of operating profit percentage is met, the multiplier is 100%, and thereafter the multiplier increases by increments of 10%. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charges may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component.
     
Strategic Component
The Strategic Component is based on a maximum of five strategic goals for each half of the year. The minimum weighting of any one individual goal is 20% and achievement of each goal is measured on a scale of 0% achievement to 150% achievement. The threshold for any payout of the Strategic Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance is capped at 150%.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant
     
has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On May 27, 2009, Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") received an adverse judicial ruling regarding a previously-disclosed dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") concerning the Company's cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland.
As the Company has previously disclosed, on August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued an opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the Company's cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and thus, under that opinion, the Company owed no tax, interest or penalties to the IRS in connection with this dispute. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit. Although the Company opposed that appeal, believing that the Tax Court decided the case correctly, the Appeals Court has now ruled against the Company regarding this dispute. The Company is in the process of reviewing the impact of the Appeals Court decision for all years open to IRS audit.
    
Because the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended March 28, 2009 was also due on May 27, 2009, the Company must delay the filing of that Form 10-K in order to consider the impact of that ruling on the disclosure in such Form 10-K.

SAN JOSE, CA, MAY 28, 2009
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) announced that on May 27, 2009, it received an adverse judicial ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit regarding a previously-disclosed dispute with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the Company's cost sharing agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary, Xilinx Ireland.
As the Company has previously disclosed, on August 30, 2005, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion where the Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the Company's cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although the Company opposed that appeal, believing that the Tax Court decided the case correctly, the Ninth Circuit has now ruled against the Company in a 2-1 majority decision.
The Ninth Circuit decision does not impact the operational direction of the Company. Considering the reserves that the Company has already recorded, the Company does not believe this decision will have a material impact on the future earnings of the Company. While the Company does not agree with the Appeals Court decision, it is premature at this time to comment on the Company's next steps as a result of the decision.

SAN JOSE, Calif., July 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today provided updated financial guidance for the June quarter of fiscal 2010.
(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020822/XLNXLOGO)
June quarter sales are expected to be down approximately 5% sequentially. This is a revision from previous sales guidance of down 4% to up 4% sequentially. The shortfall in sales is primarily due to supply constraints on certain Virtex-5 devices that are in high demand. We currently expect most of the existing delinquency issues to be resolved in the September quarter.
Gross margin guidance of 61% to 63% and operating expense guidance of flat to slightly down sequentially remain unchanged.
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this guidance revision. Additional commentary pertaining to the quarter will be available when the company reports its first quarter financial results on July 15, 2009. To receive Xilinx press releases automatically via email, please sign up for a push email alert, which is available from our investor relations website at: http://www.investor.xilinx.com.

SAN JOSE, CA, JULY 15, 2009
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced first quarter fiscal 2010 sales of $376.2 million, down 5% sequentially and down 23% from the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. First quarter net income was $38.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, including previously announced pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $15.8 million, and the reversal of $8.7 million of interest income previously accrued on the tax prepayment as a result of the recent adverse court case ruling. Collectively, these items represented approximately $0.07 per diluted share after tax.
The Xilinx Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on August 26, 2009 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 5, 2009.
Additional first quarter comparisons are represented in the charts below:
"Sales growth was impacted in the June quarter by supply constraints primarily relating to certain Virtex-5 devices in high demand," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "We reduced SG&A and R&D expenses by more than 5% sequentially and generated $128 million of operating cash flow. At the same time, we remain committed to our ongoing investment in next generation FPGA development, which we expect to drive future growth opportunities."
During the June quarter, sales from Asia Pacific increased 2% sequentially to represent a record 37% of total sales. This was up from 35% of sales in the prior quarter, and up from 32% of total sales in the same quarter a year ago. Sales from all other geographies declined sequentially during the quarter.

Highlights First Quarter Fiscal 2010

industry. Virtex-5Q FPGAs leverage the proven Virtex-5 family architecture to
deliver higher speeds, greater capacity and lower dynamic power consumption on
average over previous generations. Xilinx is the leading programmable logic provider

SAN JOSE, CA, SEPTEMBER 23, 2009

September quarter sales are expected to be up approximately 10% sequentially. This is a revision from previous sales guidance of up approximately 2% to 6% sequentially. The increased sales guidance is primarily due to broad based strength across nearly all end markets and geographies.

"I am encouraged by the broad-based recovery in our business," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong sales growth coupled with continued operating expense control contributed to a significant improvement in operating margin. September quarter operating margin was 20%, up from 15% in the prior quarter."

Highlights Second Quarter Fiscal 2010
Xilinx announced design support for Virtex-6 HXT FPGAs with Version 11.3 of the
ISE Design Suite software. Optimized for 40G/100G wired telecommunications and
data communications, Virtex-6 HXT FPGAs deliver serial interface technology to
designers of ultra-high bandwidth systems with line rates in excess of 11 Gigabits per
second. As the leader in serial connectivity solutions for FPGAs, Xilinx estimates
that it shipped over 75% of the PLD industry's FPGAs with embedded transceivers in
the September quarter.  
The Spartan-6 family continues to be the PLD industry's only 45nm high-volume
FPGA family. Manufactured by Samsung, this family marks the first time
transceiver capability and high-performance PCIe and memory controller blocks
have been integrated into a 45nm low-cost FPGA fabric. These key technologies
enable customers to make FPGA-based products and platforms that are lower
power, lower cost and easier to use.  
The Company's consistent profitability and cash flow generationeven during
challenging economic conditions, led to the Board's recent decision to increase the
quarterly cash dividend by $0.02 to $0.16 per common share. This is the fifth time
Xilinx has increased its dividend since initiating the dividend program in April
2004.

Item 5.03
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 11, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the
     
Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, approved and adopted amendments to Section 2.14 of the Company's Bylaws, effective immediately. The amendments (i) extend the advance notice period applicable to stockholders who wish to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or bring business before the annual meeting (in each case, from a minimum of 90 days to a minimum of 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders), (ii) require such stockholders to submit information regarding derivative, hedging and other transactions and arrangements that may give such stockholders an economic interest in the Company that differs from that represented by their ownership of Company stock and (iii) add a provision to allow stockholders to submit director nominations for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials in accordance with such rules as may finally be adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") providing for such stockholder nominations and proxy inclusion (the "final proxy access rules"); provided that in order to be timely any such stockholder notice must be delivered no later than 120 days before the date the Company mailed the prior year's proxy materials (or such later date as may be set by the SEC for companies without advance notice bylaws) and such stockholder must comply with the information requirements of Section 2.14 of the bylaws unless requiring such information is prohibited by the final proxy access rules.
     
As a result of the modifications to the advance notice provisions in Section 2.14 of the Company's Bylaws as described above, notice of a stockholder nomination or proposal (other than a proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) intended to be presented at the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted in accordance with the requirements of the Company's Bylaws, as amended, not later than April 16, 2010 and not earlier than March 17, 2010; provided however, that if the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within 25 days before or after the anniversary of the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders, then to be considered timely, stockholder proposals and nominations must be received by the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or publicly disclosed, whichever occurs first.
     
The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws, as amended.
     
A copy of the Bylaws, as amended effective November 11, 2009, is attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.
2.9
     
VALIDATION OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE; CONSENT

The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
     
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A
MEETING
     
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted.
     
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by written consent may be taken following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of the corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
2.11
     
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING
CONSENTS
     
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat or entitled to give consent to corporate action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any such action without a meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote or to give consents, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
     
          
(a) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and
          
(b) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
     
The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
2.12
     
PROXIES
     
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting or taking of action in writing, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
     
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
     
Before any meeting of the stockholders, the board of directors shall, when required by law, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Such inspectors shall:
     
          
(a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
(b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
          
          
(c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          
          
(e) determine when the polls shall close;
          
(f) determine the result; and
          
(g) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
2.14
     
PRIOR NOTICE FOR INCLUSION ON AGENDA
          
(a) Business. No business may be transacted at a meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.14(a) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting of stockholders, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(a).
     
In addition to any applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation and such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) days nor more than one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10 th ) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting of stockholders, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting of stockholders and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting of stockholders, and (b) as to the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting of stockholders to bring such business before the meeting, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
     
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders.
     
In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.14(a) to the contrary, a stockholder intending to nominate one or more persons for election as a director at an annual meeting must comply with Section 2.14(b) of these bylaws for such nomination to be properly brought before such meeting.
     
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the chairman of an annual meeting of stockholders determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
     
Nothing contained in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any successor provision of law).
          
(b) Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a meeting of stockholders (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.14 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting, who is entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(b). 
     
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.
     
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not less than one hundred twenty (120) days nor more than one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided , that in the event that the annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was made, whichever first occurs; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, and (iv) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (i) the name and record address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any proposed nominee or any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made by such person, and any material interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such nomination, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. 
 
     
A stockholder providing notice of any nomination proposed to be made at an annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of such annual or special meeting of stockholders.
     
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(b). If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.14(b) to the contrary, a nomination of persons for election as a director may be submitted for inclusion in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to the final rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") providing for such nominations and inclusion ("final proxy access rules"), and, if such nomination is submitted under the final proxy access rules, such submission (a) in order to be timely, must be delivered to, or be mailed and received by, the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation no later than 120 calendar days before the date that the corporation mailed (or otherwise disseminated) its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders (or such other date as may be set forth in the final proxy access rules for companies without advance notice bylaws), (b) in all other respects, must be made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the final proxy access rules, as in effect at the time of the nomination, or any successor rules or regulations of the SEC then in effect, and (c) must provide the corporation with any other information required by this Section 2.14(b) for nominations not made under the final proxy access rules except to the extent that requiring such information to be furnished is prohibited by the final proxy access rules. The provisions of this paragraph of this Section 2.14(b) do not provide stockholders of the corporation with any rights, nor impose upon the corporation any obligations, other than the rights and obligations set forth in the final proxy access rules.
3.1
     
POWERS
     
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
3.2
     
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors that shall constitute the whole board of directors shall be not less than seven (7) nor more than eleven (11), the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such range by a duly adopted resolution of the board of directors. This range shall not be altered without stockholder approval.
     
3.3
     
ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
     
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting;
provided
that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided, or until he or she shall cease to qualify. For the purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted 'for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted 'against' that director. If a director is not elected, such director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the board of directors. The board of directors will decide whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action shall be taken. The board of directors will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it promptly but no later than 120 days following the date of the certification of the election results. In reaching its decision, the board of directors may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the corporation, the overall composition of the board of directors, the underlying reasons for the outcome of the stockholders' vote with respect to the director (if ascertainable) and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation. No director who so offers to tender his or her resignation shall participate in the board of directors' decision or in the nominating and governance committee's recommendation. If a majority of the members of the nominating and governance committee fail to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director at the same meeting of stockholders, then the independent directors who did receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director will appoint a committee of the board of directors amongst themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and making a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to such tendered resignations. If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the purpose of electing directors where the election is uncontested, the incumbent board of directors will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote. In this circumstance, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.3, the incumbent board of directors will continue to serve until new directors are elected and qualified.
     
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
3.4
     
RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
     
Any director may resign effective on giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
     
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the shareholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
     
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
     
     
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
     
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
3.5
     
PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE
     
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated from time to time by resolution of the board. In the absence of such a designation, regular meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Special meetings of the board may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice, at the principal executive office of the corporation.

FIRST MEETINGS
     
The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
3.7
     
REGULAR MEETINGS
     
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice if the times of such meetings are fixed by the board of directors.

If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered personally or by telephone or to the telegraph company at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
3.9
     
QUORUM
     
A majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 3.10 of these bylaws. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
     
A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
3.10
     
WAIVER OF NOTICE
     
Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director (i) who signs a waiver of notice or a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof, whether before or after the meeting, or (ii) who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such directors. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made part of the minutes of the meeting. A waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.

3.13
     
BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting, provided that all members of the board individually or collectively consent in writing to that action. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the board of directors. Such written consent and any counterparts thereof shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.
3.14
     
FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
     
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the board of directors.

7.1
     
MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS
     
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records.
     
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
     
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
7.3
     
REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS
     
The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
8.1
     
RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
     
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action (other than action by shareholders by written consent without a meeting), the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
     
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the applicable resolution or the sixtieth (60th) day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
8.2
     
CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS
     
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
8.3
     
CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS: HOW EXECUTED
     
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.4
     
STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES
     
The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer, the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
     
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
8.5
     
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
     
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in
Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.6
     
LOST CERTIFICATES
     
Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.7
     
CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS
     
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.
     
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
     
If it should be deemed advisable in the judgment of the board of directors of the corporation that the corporation should be dissolved, the board, after the adoption of a resolution to that effect by a majority of the whole board at any meeting called for that purpose, shall cause notice to be mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereon of the adoption of the resolution and of a meeting of stockholders to take action upon the resolution.
     
At the meeting a vote shall be taken for and against the proposed dissolution. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon votes for the proposed dissolution, then a certificate stating that the dissolution has been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers shall be executed, acknowledged, and filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such certificate's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved.
     
Whenever all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution consent in writing, either in person or by duly authorized attorney, to a dissolution, no meeting of directors or stockholders shall be necessary. The consent shall be filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such consent's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved. If the consent is signed by an attorney, then the original power of attorney or a photocopy thereof shall be attached to and filed with the consent. The consent filed with the Secretary of State shall have attached to it the affidavit of the secretary or some other officer of the corporation stating that the consent has been signed by or on behalf of all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution; in addition, there shall be attached to the consent a certification by the secretary or some other officer of the corporation setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers of the corporation.
11.1
     
APPOINTMENT OF A CUSTODIAN IN CERTAIN CASES
     
The Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians and, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for the corporation when:
          
(i) at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or
          
(ii) the business of the corporation is suffering or is threatened with irreparable injury because the directors are so divided respecting the management of the affairs of the corporation that the required vote for action by the board of directors cannot be obtained and the stockholders are unable to terminate this division; or
          
(iii) the corporation has abandoned its business and has failed within a reasonable time to take steps to dissolve, liquidate or distribute its assets.
11.2
     
DUTIES OF CUSTODIAN
The custodian shall have all the powers and title of a receiver appointed under Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, but the authority of the custodian shall be to continue the business of the corporation and not to liquidate its affairs and distribute its assets, except when the Court of Chancery otherwise orders and except in cases arising under Sections 226(a)(3) or 352(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Under the terms of the Plan, each of the three plan components, the share of revenue component, the operating profit component and the strategic component are eligible for payment on a semi-annual basis. For the first half of fiscal 2010, there was no payment under the share of revenue component. The payments above were made under the operating profit component and the strategic component only. All payments above were consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan with the exception of the strategic component payments made to Messrs. Gavrielov, Peng and Ratford. The deviation from the terms and conditions of the Plan related solely to the number of goals and relative weighting of the goals under the strategic component of the Plan and had no impact on the dollar amounts of any payments. The Plan provides that the strategic component will consist of a maximum of five goals, each with a minimum weighting of 20%. For the first half of fiscal 2010, Mr. Gavrielov was paid on the basis of six goals, four of which had a weighting under 20%; Mr. Peng was paid on the basis of five goals, two of which had a weighting below 20%; and Mr. Ratford was paid on the basis of five goals, three of which had a weighting below 20%.
The Compensation Committee approved all payments to the named executive officers with the exception of Mr. Gavrielov, whose payment was approved by the independent members of the Board of Directors.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

 
SAN JOSE, CA, JANUARY 20, 2010
-- Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) today announced record third quarter fiscal 2010 sales of $513.3 million, up 24% sequentially and up 12% from the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Third quarter net income was $106.9 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, including previously announced restructuring charges totaling $5.5 million, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share. On a year over year basis, third quarter net income and diluted earnings per share declined because in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 there was a $58.3 million pre-tax gain from the early extinguishment of convertible debentures, partially
offset by a $19.5 million pre-tax impairment charge on investments.
 
The Xilinx Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2010 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2010.
 
Additional third quarter comparisons are represented in the charts below:
 
GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
 
Record sales were driven by strength from all end markets and geographic regions. New Product sales increased 32% sequentially during the quarter due primarily to strong growth from the Virtex-5 and Spartan-3 FPGA families.
 
It was a record-setting quarter for Xilinx, said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition to record total sales, Xilinxs Virtex-5 family comfortably surpassed $100 million in quarterly salesmore than any other FPGA product in history. Sales strength from this family was driven by Communications, Industrial and Other and Data Processing. Based on new design win activity, I am confident about the prospects for continued sales growth from the Virtex-5 family.
 
Products are classified as follows:
 
New Products: Virtex-6, Virtex-5, Spartan-6, Spartan-3A and Spartan-3E product families Mainstream Products: Virtex-4, Spartan-3, Spartan-II and CoolRunner-II product families
Base Products: Virtex, Virtex-E, Virtex-II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 product families Support Products: Configuration products, HardWire, Software & Support/Services

    On March 22, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Appeals Court) affirmed the August 30, 2005 tax court decision that the value of compensatory stock options are not required to be included in the cost sharing agreement between Xilinx, Inc. (the Company) and its Irish affiliate, Xilinx Ireland (the March 2010 Decision).
 
     As previously disclosed, the Company had filed a suit against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
(Commissioner) in tax court disputing the Commissioners finding that the value of compensatory stock options were costs that were to be shared between Xilinx and its affiliate, Xilinx Ireland, under their cost sharing agreement. The tax court initially decided in favor of the Company and rejected the Commissioners position that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Companys cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On August 25, 2006, the Commissioner appealed the tax court decision to the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the tax court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009, and subsequently affirmed the tax court decision in the March 2010 Decision.
 
    
As a direct result of the March 2010 Decision, the Company would expect to receive a refund from the IRS of approximately $24.3 million and interest of approximately $9.4 million for the tax years 1997, 1998 and 1999. The Company is in the process of reviewing the potential impact the March 2010 Decision would have for all years open to IRS audit.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
2011 Executive Incentive Plan
On May 12, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2011 (the "2011 Incentive Plan"). The 2011 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of its financial and strategic objectives. The 2011 Incentive Plan is effective as of April 1, 2010.
The 2011 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2011, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 110% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 60% to 75% of their respective base salaries, depending on their position.
Under the 2011 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using four different components, each with a different weighting. The four components are: (1) the Company's share of revenue (the "SOR Component"), weighted at 10%; (2) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "OP Component"), weighted at 30%; (3) the Company's revenue growth (the "Growth Component"), weighted at 20%; and (4) management objective goals pertaining to each officer's position and responsibilities (the "Management Objectives Component"), weighted at 40%. All components are paid on a semi-annual basis, except for the Growth Component which is paid on an annual basis.
SOR Component
The SOR Component is designed to measure and reward increases in the Company's share of revenue as compared to benchmark programmable logic device companies identified by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The SOR Component is subject to a minimum threshold for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. The SOR Component multiplier is 50% if the minimum threshold percentage is reached and 100% if the target percentage is reached. After the target percentage is reached, the multiplier increases by increments of 25%, and is capped at a maximum of 200%.
OP Component
The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit. The OP Component is subject to a minimum threshold range for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. For the OP Component, the threshold range of operating profit percentages is subject to a multiplier of 20%, and the multiplier increases by increments of 10% after the top of the threshold range is met. If the target range of operating profit percentage is met, the multiplier is 100%, and thereafter the multiplier increases by increments of 10%. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charges may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component.
Growth Component
The Growth Component is designed to reward year-over-year revenue growth. The Growth Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The Growth Component multiplier is 20% if the minimum threshold is met and 100% if the target range is met. If the target range of revenue growth percentage is met, the multiplier increases by increments of 20% for each percentage increase in revenue growth, and is capped at an annual maximum of 200%.
Management Objectives Component
The Management Objectives Component is based on a maximum of ten individual management goals per semi-annual performance period. Achievement of each goal is measured on a scale of 0% achievement to 150% achievement. The threshold for any payout of the Management Objectives Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance is capped at 150%.

On June 3, 2010, Xilinx, Inc. ("Xilinx") issued a press release relating to a proposed offering of $520 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. In connection with the proposed offering, the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of its common stock, subject to the pricing of the proposed notes offering. This is in addition to the amount remaining under Xilinx's previous repurchase authorization. A copy of this press release is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: June 3, 2010
 

Exhibit 99.1
Xilinx Investor Relations Xilinx, Inc. Lori Owen (408) 879-6911
lori.owen@xilinx.com
 Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) today announced that it proposes to offer $520 million of convertible senior notes, subject to market conditions and other factors. The notes would be due in June 2017 and are to be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will be convertible upon certain conditions. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and deliver shares of Xilinx common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted. The conversion rate and other terms will be determined by negotiations between the Company and the initial purchasers of the notes. Xilinx also intends to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes the right to purchase up to an additional $80 million principal amount of notes solely to cover overallotments.
SAN JOSE, CA, JUNE 3, 2010
Xilinx intends to use most of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock, and a portion of the net proceeds to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below. The share repurchases will be conducted through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate as the Company's agent in negotiated transactions with institutional investors concurrently with this offering and under an accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to an agreement with one of the initial purchasers or its affiliates. The repurchases are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the notes. The counterparty to the accelerated share repurchase program or its affiliates may buy or sell Xilinx common stock in the secondary market to hedge its position concurrently with, and after, the pricing of the notes, and expects to purchase or sell Xilinx common stock in secondary market transactions during the term of the program. The balance of the net proceeds from the offering is expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
Xilinx intends to enter into warrant transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates, which could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price of Xilinx common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. Xilinx also intends to enter into convertible bond hedge transactions in its common stock with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates, in order to limit potential dilution from conversion of the notes.
In connection with the establishment of their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and any subsequent modification of such hedge positions, the hedge counterparties have advised Xilinx that they or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Xilinx common stock and purchase or sell Xilinx common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes, including during any observation period related to a conversion of notes. These hedging activities, as well as the activities associated with the share repurchases described above, could initially raise or maintain the market price of Xilinx common stock or the notes and could subsequently otherwise affect the market price of Xilinx common stock or the notes.
 
If the initial purchasers exercise their overallotment option, Xilinx may enter into additional convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. Xilinx also may use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional notes to repurchase additional shares of its common stock.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.
The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
This release contains forward-looking statements and projections. Forward-looking statements and projections can often be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "expect," "may," "will," "could," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project" or other similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements and projections, which speak only as of the date they are made. Xilinx undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, whether or not Xilinx will offer the notes or consummate the offering, the anticipated terms of the notes and the offering and the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On June 3, 2010, Xilinx, Inc. ("Xilinx") priced $520 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes"). The Notes will be sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Xilinx has granted to the initial purchasers of the Notes the right to purchase up to an additional $80 million principal amount of Notes solely to cover overallotments.
Prior to the closing of the offering of the Notes, we expect to enter into an indenture governing the Notes (the "Indenture") with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.625% per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2010. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2017, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The Notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into shares of Xilinx's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Xilinx common stock"). Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, the holders of the Notes may require Xilinx to purchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. For additional information about the conversion rights of the Notes, see Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The Notes and the underlying Xilinx common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
Xilinx has also entered into warrant transactions with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the Notes whereby it will sell warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the number of shares of Xilinx common stock underlying the Notes. The warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price of Xilinx common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. If the initial purchasers exercise their overallotment option to purchase additional Notes, Xilinx may sell additional warrants.
Xilinx has entered into convertible note hedge transactions in its common stock with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the Notes, in order to limit potential dilution from conversion of the Notes.
In connection with the establishment of their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and any subsequent modification of such hedge positions, the hedge counterparties have advised Xilinx that they or their respective affiliates have entered into and expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Xilinx common stock and expect to purchase or sell Xilinx common stock. These activities occurred concurrently with, and will continue shortly after, the pricing of the Notes and may also occur prior to the maturity of the Notes, including during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes. These hedging activities, as well as the activities associated with the share repurchases described below, could initially raise or maintain the market price of Xilinx common stock or the Notes and could subsequently otherwise affect the market price of Xilinx common stock or the Notes.
 
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On June 3, 2010, Xilinx entered into a definitive agreement to offer and sell the Notes. The Notes will be sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes will be convertible upon certain conditions. Upon conversion, Xilinx will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted and deliver shares of Xilinx common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate is 33.0164 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $30.29 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes on or after March 15, 2017 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to March 15, 2017, holders may convert their Notes under any of the following conditions:
Also on June 3, 2010, Xilinx agreed to sell warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, common stock of Xilinx in separate warrant transactions in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The warrants have an exercise price of $42.91 per share. Xilinx expects to receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $39 million from these transactions. If the market price of the Xilinx common stock at the time of exercise of the applicable warrants exceeds the strike price of those warrants, Xilinx will owe the affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers net shares of Xilinx common stock in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Xilinx common stock over the strike price of the applicable warrants. If the market value of Xilinx's common stock at the maturity of the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrants, the dilution mitigation under the convertible note hedge transactions described above under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K will be capped, which means that there would be dilution from conversion of the Notes to the extent the then market value per share of Xilinx's common stock, as measured under the convertible note hedge transactions, exceeds the strike price of the warrants at the time of conversion.
Xilinx estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $452.9 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts, the estimated offering expenses and the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions. The net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and the separate warrant transactions was approximately $57 million. The offering is expected to close on June 9, 2010.
Xilinx is filing the information above under Item 3.02. However, as a result of the obligations under the Notes upon conversion being payable in cash as described above, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes may constitute less than 1% of the number of shares outstanding of the common stock of Xilinx.
 
Item 8.01. Other Events.
Xilinx intends to use up to $433.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to an agreement with one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. The repurchases of the shares of common stock by the Company are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the Notes. The counterparty to the accelerated share repurchase program or its affiliate expects to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Xilinx common stock and may buy or sell Xilinx common stock in the secondary market to hedge its position concurrently with, and after, the pricing of the Notes, and expects to purchase or sell Xilinx common stock in secondary market transactions during the term of the program. Xilinx expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described above, taking into account the proceeds of the warrant transactions, and to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Xilinx has also entered into at market fixed to floating rate swaps with respect to the Notes with one or more banks or their respective affiliates.
On June 4, 2010, Xilinx issued a press release with respect to the foregoing transactions. As required by Rule 135c(d) under the Securities Act, this is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K

Exhibit 99.1
Xilinx Investor Relations Xilinx, Inc. Lori Owen (408) 879-6911
lori.owen@xilinx.com
 Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) today announced that it has priced $520 million of 2.625% convertible senior notes due in June 2017. The notes will be sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The sale is expected to close on June 9, 2010. Xilinx has granted to the initial purchasers of the notes the right to purchase up to an additional $80 million principal amount of notes solely to cover overallotments.
SAN JOSE, CA, JUNE 4, 2010
Interest will be payable on the notes semiannually at a rate of 2.625% percent per year. The notes will be convertible upon certain conditions. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes to be converted and deliver shares of Xilinx common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 33.0164 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $30.29 per share, representing a 20% conversion premium based on the closing price of Xilinx's common stock of $25.24 per share on June 3, 2010. The notes mature on June 15, 2017.
Xilinx estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $452.9 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts, the estimated offering expenses and the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions.
Xilinx intends to use up to $433.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to an agreement with one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. The repurchases of the shares of common stock by the Company are conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the notes. The counterparty to the accelerated share repurchase program or its affiliate expects to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Xilinx common stock and may buy or sell Xilinx common stock in the secondary market to hedge its position concurrently with, and after, the pricing of the notes, and expects to purchase or sell Xilinx common stock in secondary market transactions during the term of the program. Xilinx expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described below, taking into account the proceeds of the warrant transactions, and to use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Xilinx has entered into warrant transactions with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes whereby it will sell warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the number of shares of Xilinx common stock underlying the notes. The warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price of Xilinx common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. If the initial purchasers exercise their overallotment option to purchase additional notes, Xilinx may sell additional warrants.
 
Xilinx has entered into convertible note hedge transactions in its common stock with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes, in order to limit potential dilution from conversion of the notes.
In connection with the establishment of their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and any subsequent modification of such hedge positions, the hedge counterparties have advised Xilinx that they or their respective affiliates have entered into and expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Xilinx common stock and expect to purchase or sell Xilinx common stock. These activities occurred concurrently with, and will continue shortly after, the pricing of the notes and may also occur prior to the maturity of the notes, including during any observation period related to a conversion of notes. These hedging activities, as well as the activities associated with the share repurchases described above, could initially raise or maintain the market price of Xilinx common stock or the notes and could subsequently otherwise affect the market price of Xilinx common stock or the notes.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.

GAAP Results
The sales decline during the quarter was driven primarily by weaker than anticipated wireless communications sales to customers in Europe and North America.
"While we did not achieve a fifth consecutive quarter of record sales, I am pleased with the Company's continued focus on cost reduction and financial discipline. This is reflected in gross margin and operating margin of 65.7% and 32%, respectively, in the December quarter. This is up from 64.1% and 27% in the same quarter of the prior year," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we embark upon 2011, I am encouraged by initial manufacturing milestones we have achieved on the new 28nm technology node. When coupled with the competitive advantages offered by our 7 series FPGAs, I believe Xilinx is positioned to establish clear market share leadership on this technology node."

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Executive Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2012
On April 29, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2012 (the "2012 Incentive Plan"). The 2012 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of its financial and individual performance objectives. The 2012 Incentive Plan is effective as of April 3, 2011.
The 2012 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2012, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 110% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 60% to 75% of their respective base salaries, depending on their position.
Under the 2012 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using three different components, each with a different weighting. The three components are: (1) the Company's revenue growth (the "Growth Component"), weighted at 20%; (2) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "OP Component"), weighted at 30%; and (3) individual performance goals pertaining to each officer's position and responsibilities (the "Individual Performance Component"), weighted at 50%. The OP Component and Individual Performance Component are paid on a semi-annual basis, and the Growth Component is paid on an annual basis.
Growth Component
The Growth Component is designed to reward year-over-year revenue growth. The Growth Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The Growth Component multiplier is 20% if the minimum threshold is met and 100% if the target range is met. If the target range of revenue growth percentage is met, the multiplier increases by increments of 20% for each percentage increase in revenue growth, and is capped at an annual maximum of 200%.
OP Component
The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit. The OP Component is subject to a minimum threshold range for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. For the OP Component, the threshold range of operating profit percentages is subject to a multiplier of 20%, and the multiplier increases by increments of 10% after the top of the threshold range is met. If the target range of operating profit percentage is met, the multiplier is 100%, and thereafter the multiplier increases by increments of 10%. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charges may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component. The OP Component is not subject to a cap.
Individual Performance Component
The Individual Performance Component is based on a maximum of ten individual performance goals per semi-annual performance period. Achievement of each goal is measured on a scale of 0% achievement to 150% achievement. The minimum threshold for any payout of the Individual Performance Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance multiplier is capped at 150%.

Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards
On June 7, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards to the Company's executive officers (other than our Chief Executive Officer), as part of the Company's executive incentive program for fiscal year 2012. Such grants shall be effective on July 5, 2011 (the "Grant Date"). Also on June 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards to the Chief Executive Officer, also to be effective on the Grant Date. Accordingly, on the Grant Date, each of the following executive officers will be granted a number of restricted stock units determined by dividing a dollar amount specified for each individual by the average closing price per share of our common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market for the three-month period ending on the Grant Date.
Of the computed number of restricted stock units, 40% of the restricted stock units (rounded up to the nearest 500) will be made subject to an award that will vest subject to the executive's continuous employment through the third anniversary of the Grant Date. The remaining 60% of the restricted stock units (rounded up to the nearest 500) will constitute a performance-based target award, with the number of restricted stock units actually earned and vested to be scaled either down or up from the target amount (but not in excess of 150% of the target amount) based on the Company's degree of achievement of specified performance goals and subject to the executive's continued employment over a three-year vesting period (the "Performance-Based Units").
The Performance-Based Units will be earned based on the extent of the Company's performance during our 2012 fiscal year as determined under three metrics: (1) the Company's share of the total revenue for the performance period of a group consisting of the Company and competitors specified by the Compensation Committee, (2) a pre-established technology leadership metric specified by the Compensation Committee and (3) a pre-established quality leadership metric specified by the Compensation Committee. These three metrics are weighted 20%, 50% and 30%, respectively, and measured on a scale of 0% to 150% of the target goal. Following the completion of fiscal 2012, the Compensation Committee will determine the extent of the Company's performance for the year against each metric, and the resulting weighted performance achievement factor will be multiplied by an executive's target award to determine the number of Performance-Based Units earned by that executive. These earned units will vest in equal installments ending on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date, subject to the executive's continued employment.
Amendment to Executive Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2012
On June 7, 2011, the Board of Directors also approved an amendment to certain terms of the Chief Executive Officer's participation in the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2012 (the "2012 Incentive Plan), which was adopted by the Compensation Committee on April 29, 2011 and disclosed on a Form 8-K filed on May 3, 2011. This amendment to the 2012 Incentive Plan provides that the individual performance component of the plan applicable to the Chief Executive Officer will be established, measured and paid on an annual basis rather than a semi-annual basis. The individual performance component for all other executive officers will continue to be established, measured and paid on a semi-annual basis.

GAAP Results
"Sales growth during the September quarter was impacted by weaker than expected business conditions particularly in the Communications and Industrial and Other categories. In spite of declining sales, operating margin for the quarter was 28% as a result of higher-than-expected gross margin and a commensurate slow down of spending in recognition of the environment," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. "Additionally, we continued to demonstrate leadership on the 28-nm node by recently taping out our sixth device, achieving to date over 200 design wins, and shipping parts to 50 discrete customers."

Executive Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2013
On May 10, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2013 (the "2013 Incentive Plan"). The 2013 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the Company's achievement of financial and individual performance objectives. The 2013 Incentive Plan is effective as of April 1, 2012.
The 2013 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officer's base salary. For fiscal 2013, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is 125% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 60% to 75% of their respective base salaries, depending on their position.
Under the 2013 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using three different components, each with a different weighting. The three components are: (1) the Company's revenue growth (the "Growth Component"), weighted at 30%; (2) the Company's operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "OP Component"), weighted at 30%; and (3) individual performance goals pertaining to each officer's position and responsibilities (the "Individual Performance Component"), weighted at 40%. For all executive officers other than the CEO, the OP Component and the Individual Performance Component are paid on a semi-annual basis, and the Growth Component is paid on an annual basis. For the CEO, the OP Component is paid on a semi-annual basis, and the Individual Performance Component and the Growth Component are paid on an annual basis.
Growth Component
The Growth Component is designed to reward year-over-year revenue growth. The Growth Component is subject to a minimum threshold for payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The Growth Component multiplier is 20% if the minimum threshold is met and 100% if the target is met. If the target revenue growth percentage is met, the multiplier increases by increments of 20% for each percentage increase in revenue growth, and is capped at an annual maximum of 200%.
OP Component
The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Company's operating profit. The OP Component is subject to a minimum threshold range for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. For the OP Component, the threshold range of operating profit percentages is subject to a multiplier of 20%, and the multiplier increases by increments of 10% after the top of the threshold range is met. If the target range of operating profit percentage is met, the multiplier is 100%, and thereafter the multiplier increases by increments of 10%. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charges may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component. The OP Component is capped at a maximum of 200% for each semi-annual period.
Individual Performance Component
The Individual Performance Component is based on a maximum of ten individual performance goals per semi-annual performance period. Achievement of each goal is measured on a scale of 0% achievement to 150% achievement. The threshold for any payout of the Individual Performance Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance is capped at 150%.
Named Executive Officer Salary Adjustments
Also on May 10, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the following salary adjustments for fiscal 2013 for the following named executive officers, effective July 1, 2012:
 
On May 9, 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Xilinx, Inc., upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, approved and adopted amendments to Section 2.14 and Section 3.15 of the Company's Bylaws, effective immediately. The amendment to Section 2.14(b) of the Bylaws eliminates a provision to allow stockholders to submit director nominations for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials in accordance with such rules as may finally be adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission providing for such stockholder nominations and proxy inclusion. The amendment to Section 3.15 eliminates that provision, which is in regard to loans to officers, in its entirety.
The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws, as amended.
A copy of the Bylaws, as amended effective May 9, 2012, is attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.2
 
 
 
 
 
The registered office of the corporation shall be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
 
The board of directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
 
Meetings of shareholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, shareholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation.
 
The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of shareholders shall be held on the third Tuesday of July in each year at 10:00 a.m. However, if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.
 
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president.
 
All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.
 
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either personally or by first-class mail or by telegraphic or other written communication. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the shareholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. If no such address appears on the corporation's books or is given, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent to that stockholder by mail or telegraphic or other written communication to the corporation's principal executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is located. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or other means of written communication.
If any notice addressed to a stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the stockholder at that address, then all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available to the stockholder on written demand of the stockholder at the principal executive office of the corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice.
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.6 of these bylaws.
When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of these bylaws. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the proposal; but, if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled to vote.
 
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by written consent may be taken following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of the corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat or entitled to give consent to corporate action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any such action without a meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote or to give consents, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(a) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and
(b) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
 
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting or taking of action in writing, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
Before any meeting of the stockholders, the board of directors shall, when required by law, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Such inspectors shall:
(a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
(b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
(c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
(e) determine when the polls shall close;
(f) determine the result; and
(g) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
 
(a) Business. No business may be transacted at a meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.14(a) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting of stockholders, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(a).
 
In addition to any applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation and such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) days nor more than one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting of stockholders, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting of stockholders and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting of stockholders, and (b) as to the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting of stockholders to bring such business before the meeting, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders.
In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.14(a) to the contrary, a stockholder intending to nominate one or more persons for election as a director at an annual meeting must comply with Section 2.14(b) of these bylaws for such nomination to be properly brought before such meeting.
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the chairman of an annual meeting of stockholders determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any successor provision of law).
(b) Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a meeting of stockholders (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.14 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting, who is entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(b).
 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not less than one hundred twenty (120) days nor more than one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, that in the event that the annual meeting of stockholders is called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders was made, whichever first occurs; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, and (iv) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (i) the name and record address of the stockholder giving the notice and the name and principal place of business of such beneficial owner, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of the corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of shares of stock of the corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any proposed nominee or any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made by such person, and any material interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such nomination, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
A stockholder providing notice of any nomination proposed to be made at an annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of such annual or special meeting of stockholders.
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14(b). If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
The number of directors that shall constitute the whole board of directors shall be not less than seven (7) nor more than eleven (11), the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such range by a duly adopted resolution of the board of directors. This range shall not be altered without stockholder approval.
 
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such director at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting; that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided, or until he or she shall cease to qualify. For the purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. If a director is not elected, such director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the board of directors. The board of directors will decide whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action shall be taken. The board of directors will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it promptly but no later than 120 days following the date of the certification of the election results. In reaching its decision, the board of directors may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the corporation, the overall composition of the board of directors, the underlying reasons for the outcome of the stockholders' vote with respect to the director (if ascertainable) and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation. No director who so offers to tender his or her resignation shall participate in the board of directors' decision or in the nominating and governance committee's recommendation. If a majority of the members of the nominating and governance committee fail to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director at the same meeting of stockholders, then the independent directors who did receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to each such director will appoint a committee of the board of directors amongst themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and making a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to such tendered resignations. If no directors receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the purpose of electing directors where the election is uncontested, the incumbent board of directors will nominate a new slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees within 180 days after the certification of the stockholder vote. In this circumstance, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.3, the incumbent board of directors will continue to serve until new directors are elected and qualified.
provided
 
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Any director may resign effective on giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the shareholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
 
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
 
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated from time to time by resolution of the board. In the absence of such a designation, regular meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Special meetings of the board may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice, at the principal executive office of the corporation.
Any meeting, regular or special, may be held by conference telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as all directors participating in the meeting can hear one another; and all such directors shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting.
 
The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
 
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice if the times of such meetings are fixed by the board of directors.
 
Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two directors.
Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered personally or by telephone or to the telegraph company at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
A majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 3.10 of these bylaws. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
 
Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director (i) who signs a waiver of notice or a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof, whether before or after the meeting, or (ii) who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such directors. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made part of the minutes of the meeting. A waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.
 
A majority of the directors present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.
 
Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four (24) hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four (24) hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given before the adjourned meeting takes place, in the manner specified in Section 3.8 of these bylaws, to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting, provided that all members of the board individually or collectively consent in writing to that action. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the board of directors. Such written consent and any counterparts thereof shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.
 
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the board of directors. This Section 3.14 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
 
 
The board of directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors, designate one (1) or more committees, each consisting of one or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. The board may designate one (1) or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. The appointment of members or alternate members of a committee requires the vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors. Any committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board in the management of the business and affairs of the company, as provided in Section 141 of the General Corporations Law of Delaware.
 
Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of Article III of these bylaws, Section 3.5 (place of meetings), Section 3.7 (regular meetings), Section 3.8 (special meetings and notice), Section 3.9 (quorum), Section 3.10 (waiver of notice), Section 3.11 (adjournment), Section 3.12 (notice of adjournment), and Section 3.13 (action without meeting), with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the board of directors and its members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the board of directors or by resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the board of directors, and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. The board of directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws.
 
The officers of the corporation shall be a president, a secretary and a chief financial officer. The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, a chairman of the board, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these bylaws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person.
 
The officers of the corporation, except such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 or Section 5.5 of these bylaws, shall be chosen by the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment.
 
The board of directors may appoint, or may empower the president to appoint, such other officers as the business of the corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these bylaws or as the board of directors may from time to time determine.
 
Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in case of an officer chosen by the board of directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the board of directors.
Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
 
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause shall be filled in the manner prescribed in these bylaws for regular appointments to that office.
 
The chairman of the board, if such an officer be elected, shall, if present, preside at meetings of the board of directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the board of directors or as may be prescribed by these bylaws. If there is no president, then the chairman of the board shall also be the chief executive officer of the corporation and shall have the powers and duties prescribed in Section 5.7 of these bylaws.
 
Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the board of directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation and shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have general supervision, direction, and control of the business and the officers of the corporation. He or she shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, in the absence or nonexistence of a chairman of the board, at all meetings of the board of directors. He or she shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of president of a corporation, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
 
In the absence or disability of the president, the vice presidents, if any, in order of their rank as fixed by the board of directors or, if not ranked, a vice president designated by the board of directors, shall perform all the duties of the president and when so acting shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions upon, the president. The vice presidents shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed for them respectively by the board of directors, these bylaws, the president or the chairman of the board.
 
The secretary shall keep or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation or such other place as the board of directors may direct, a book of minutes of all meetings and actions of directors, committees of directors and stockholders. The minutes shall show the time and place of each meeting, whether regular or special (and, if special, how authorized and the notice given), the names of those present at directors' meetings or committee meetings, the number of shares present or represented at stockholders' meetings, and the proceedings thereof.
The secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation or at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar, as determined by resolution of the board of directors, a share register, or a duplicate share register, showing the names of all stockholders and their addresses, the number and classes of shares held by each, the number and date of certificates evidencing such shares, and the number and date of cancellation of every certificate surrendered for cancellation.
The secretary shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and of the board of directors required to be given by law or by these bylaws. He or she shall keep the seal of the corporation, if one be adopted, in safe custody and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or by these bylaws.
 
The chief financial officer shall keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained, adequate and correct books and records of accounts of the properties and business transactions of the corporation, including accounts of its assets, liabilities, receipts, disbursements, gains, losses, capital, retained earnings and shares. The books of account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any director.
The chief financial officer shall deposit all money and other valuables in the name and to the credit of the corporation with such depositaries as may be designated by the board of directors. He or she shall disburse the funds of the corporation as may be ordered by the board of directors, shall render to the president and directors, whenever they request it, an account of all of his or her transactions as chief financial officer and of the financial condition of the corporation, and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
 
The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records.
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
 
The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action (other than action by shareholders by written consent without a meeting), the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the applicable resolution or the sixtieth (60th) day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer, the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.
 
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
If it should be deemed advisable in the judgment of the board of directors of the corporation that the corporation should be dissolved, the board, after the adoption of a resolution to that effect by a majority of the whole board at any meeting called for that purpose, shall cause notice to be mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereon of the adoption of the resolution and of a meeting of stockholders to take action upon the resolution.
At the meeting a vote shall be taken for and against the proposed dissolution. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon votes for the proposed dissolution, then a certificate stating that the dissolution has been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers shall be executed, acknowledged, and filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such certificate's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved.
Whenever all the stockholders entitled to vote on dissolution consent in writing, either in person or by duly authorized attorney, to a dissolution, no meeting of directors or stockholders shall be necessary. The consent shall be filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such consent's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved. If the consent is signed by an attorney, then the original power of attorney or a photocopy thereof shall be attached to and filed with the consent. The consent filed with the Secretary of State shall have attached to it the affidavit of the secretary or some other officer of the corporation stating that the consent has been signed by or on behalf of all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution; in addition, there shall be attached to the consent a certification by the secretary or some other officer of the corporation setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers of the corporation.
 
 
The Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians and, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for the corporation when:
(i) at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or
(ii) the business of the corporation is suffering or is threatened with irreparable injury because the directors are so divided respecting the management of the affairs of the corporation that the required vote for action by the board of directors cannot be obtained and the stockholders are unable to terminate this division; or
(iii) the corporation has abandoned its business and has failed within a reasonable time to take steps to dissolve, liquidate or distribute its assets.
 
The custodian shall have all the powers and title of a receiver appointed under Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, but the authority of the custodian shall be to continue the business of the corporation and not to liquidate its affairs and distribute its assets, except when the Court of Chancery otherwise orders and except in cases arising under Sections 226(a)(3) or 352(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
The undersigned person appointed in the Certificate of Incorporation to act as the Incorporator of Xilinx, Inc. hereby adopts the foregoing bylaws, comprising twenty-four (24) pages, as the Bylaws of the corporation.
Executed this 6th day of February 1990.

On May 18, 2012, the jury in the trial of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG ("PACT") against Xilinx, Inc., ( the "Company") in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07-CV-563) concluded its deliberations. The jury found two patents held by PACT were valid and were willfully infringed by the Company. The jury awarded PACT the sum of $15.4 million as damages and royalties on past Xilinx sales. The presiding judge will decide the component for willful infringement at a future date which has not yet been determined, and such enhanced damages, including the willfulness component, could be as much as treble the $15.4 million jury verdict.
PACT filed its patent infringement lawsuit against the Company on December 28, 2007. The lawsuit pertained to eleven different patents and PACT sought injunctive relief, damages including ongoing royalties and enhanced damages, interest and attorneys' fees. The claims relating to nine of the eleven patents were dismissed from the case prior to trial.
The Company intends to appeal the verdict and is evaluating its other options, including motions for judgment as a matter of law.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On June 13, 2012, Xilinx, Inc. (the "Corporation") entered into and approved amendments to the employment letter agreement entered into between the Corporation and Moshe Gavrielov, the Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer on January 4, 2008, and the employment letter agreement entered into between the Corporation and Jon Olson, the Corporation's Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, on June 2, 2005, as amended on February 14, 2008.
The amendments to Mr. Gavrielov's and Mr. Olson's employment letter agreements clarify certain provisions of such agreements that relate to the acceleration of vesting terms. Specifically, (i) with respect to the 24 months' additional vesting of equity awards that Mr. Gavrielov is entitled to receive if the Corporation terminates his employment other than for Cause (as defined in his employment letter agreement) or due to a disability, or he voluntarily terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in his employment letter agreement) and (ii) with respect to the 12 months' additional vesting of equity awards that Mr. Olson is entitled to receive if he is involuntarily terminated without Cause (as defined in his employment letter agreement) within one year following the consummation of a Change of Control (as defined in his employment letter agreement):
(a)(1) for any performance-based restricted stock units ("Performance-Based RSUs") for which the number of earned restricted stock units has not been determined as of the date of termination, for both Mr. Gavrielov and Mr. Olson, to the extent such termination, as described above, occurs within one year following the consummation of a Change in Control (as defined in his amended offer letter agreement), the number of Performance-Based RSUS that will be deemed earned for purposes of such accelerated vesting will equal the target number of restricted stock units set forth in the applicable award agreement (the "Target Number of RSUs), provided that for Mr. Gavrielov, if his employment is terminated for the reasons described above at any time other than within one year following the consummation of a Change in Control, the number of Performance-Based RSUs that will become earned for purposes of such 24 months' accelerated vesting will not be the Target Number of RSUs but will instead be determined based on actual performance of the applicable performance metrics, as, and at such time as, determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and (2) to the extent any earned restricted stock units are subject to "cliff" vesting on one or more anniversaries of the date of grant, solely for purposes of determining the number of such earned restricted stock units that shall vest upon termination, such earned restricted stock units will be treated as instead being subject to monthly vesting in equal installments from the applicable date of grant, and Mr. Gavrielov and Mr. Olson will become vested in the number of earned restricted stock units that would have vested during the period commencing from the applicable date of grant and continuing until the applicable termination date and during an additional 24-month or 12-month period, respectively, following the applicable termination date; and
(b) for restricted stock units not subject to vesting based on performance metrics ("RSUs"), to the extent any such RSUs are subject to "cliff" vesting on one or more anniversaries of the date of grant, solely for purposes of determining the number of such RSUs that shall vest upon termination, such RSUs will be treated as instead being subject to monthly vesting in equal installments from the applicable date of grant, and Mr. Gavrielov and Mr. Olson will become vested in that number of RSUs that would have vested during the period commencing from the date of grant and continuing until the applicable termination date and during an additional 24-month or 12-month period, respectively, following the applicable termination date.
The description of the amendments set forth herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the amendments, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.17 and 10.18.

Exhibit 10.17
THIS AMENDMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is entered into as of June 13, 2012, by and between Xilinx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Moshe Gavrielov (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive previously entered into an employment agreement dated January 2, 2008 (the "Agreement"), which sets forth various terms of the Executive's employment;
WHEREAS, among other terms, the Agreement provides for certain benefits in the event the Executive's employment is terminated for certain qualifying reasons, as set forth in the Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive now wish to amend the Agreement in order to clarify the treatment of certain equity awards in the event the Executive's employment is terminated for such certain qualifying reasons;
NOW, THEREFORE, in exchange for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Executive agree to amend the Agreement as set forth below:

Additionally, you will be required to tender your resignation as a member of the Board."
 
"In the event that it is determined that payments pursuant to this Agreement constitute non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), then, solely to the extent required in order to avoid taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, no such amounts shall be paid unless and until you have experienced a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A and any such amount that would be paid to you within six (6) months following your separation of service shall be accumulated and paid to you on the first business day following such six (6) month period.
 
The parties hereto intend that this Agreement comply, to the extent applicable, with the provisions of Section 409A and related regulations and Treasury pronouncements. If the parties determine in good faith that any provision provided herein would result in the imposition of an excise tax under the provisions of Section 409A, the parties hereby agree to use good faith efforts to reform any such provision to avoid imposition of any such excise tax in such manner that the parties mutually determine is appropriate to comply with Section 409A."

In addition, you will be credited with twelve (12) months accelerated vesting of all equity grants you received from the Company prior to such termination of employment, provided that with respect to (i) any outstanding awards of performance-based restricted stock units for which the number of earned restricted stock units has not been determined as of the date of termination, the number of performance-based restricted stock units that will be deemed earned for purposes of vesting shall be the target number of restricted stock units set forth in the applicable award agreement and with respect to any earned restricted stock units that are subject to "cliff" vesting on one or more anniversaries of the date of grant, solely for purposes of determining the number of earned restricted stock units that shall vest upon termination, the performance-based restricted stock units shall be treated as instead being subject to monthly vesting in equal installments from the applicable date of grant and you shall become vested in that number of earned restricted stock units that would have vested during the period commencing from the date of grant and continuing up to your termination date and during an additional twelve (12) month period following your termination date (ii) any outstanding awards of restricted stock units that are not subject to performance metrics and that are subject to "cliff" vesting on one or more anniversaries of the date of grant, solely for purposes of determining the number of such restricted stock units that shall vest upon termination, such restricted stock units shall be treated as instead being subject to monthly vesting in equal installments from the applicable date of grant and you shall become vested in that number of restricted stock units that would have vested during the period commencing from the date of grant and continuing up to your termination date and during an additional twelve (12) month period following your termination date. Further, if you timely elect coverage as provided under the applicable provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA"), the Company will make the COBRA premium payments for you, and your dependants, if applicable, for twelve (12) months following termination. All other benefits including Company paid life insurance will cease as of the date of your termination."

GAAP Results
(In millions, except EPS)
 
Sales from our 28-nm products are off to an excellent start, as we are realizing the advantages of our breakout portfolio that now includes not only FPGAs but our pioneering All Programmable 3DICs and SoCs. In the June quarter, sales from these products, including Virtex-7 and Kintex-7 FPGAs, Virtex-7 3D IC, and Zynq-7000 SoC products, increased significantly, passing our $10 million milestone. We continue to expect the 28-nm node to be Xilinx's most successful ever, said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, gross margin remained very healthy during the quarter at 66.0%. This was at the high end of our forecast due primarily to a continued focus by the Company on yield improvement and cost reduction.

(In millions, except EPS)
 
New Product sales increased 17% sequentially in the December quarter, driven by robust adoption of Kintex-7 and Virtex-6 FPGAs. Strength from New Products is an encouraging sign in the face of macroeconomic conditions that remained challenging during the quarter," said Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer. Exiting calendar 2012, I believe we have the strongest product portfolio in our history, a generation ahead of the competition. Our 28-nm products have gained significant momentum across a broad base of applications with clear leadership in performance, power and integration. Sales from these product families increased nearly 20% sequentially in the December quarter, exceeding expectations.

Executive Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2014
On May 15, 2013 and May 16, 2013 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Xilinx, Inc. (the Company) approved the Companys Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2014 (the 2014 Incentive Plan). The 2014 Incentive Plan is designed to tie executive compensation to the executives achievement of individual performance goals and the Companys achievement of financial objectives. The 2014 Incentive Plan is effective as of March 31, 2013.
The 2014 Incentive Plan provides for a cash bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive officers base salary. For fiscal 2014, the bonus target for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is 140% of his base salary and the bonus targets for all other executive officers range from 65% to 80% of their respective base salaries, depending on their position.
Under the 2014 Incentive Plan, the cash bonuses for the CEO and all other executive officers are determined using three different components, each with a different weighting. The three components are: (1) the Companys revenue growth (the Growth Component), weighted at 30%; (2) the Companys operating profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the OP Component), weighted at 30%; and (3) individual performance goals pertaining to each officers position and responsibilities (the Individual Performance Component), weighted at 40%. For all executive officers other than the CEO, the OP Component and the Individual Performance Component are paid on a semi-annual basis, and the Growth Component is paid on an annual basis. For the CEO, the OP Component is paid on a semi-annual basis, and the Individual Performance Component and the Growth Component are paid on an annual basis.
Growth Component
The Growth Component is designed to reward year-over-year revenue growth. The Growth Component is subject to a minimum threshold for any payout and a multiplier that increases the target payout depending on Company performance. The Growth Component multiplier is 16% if the minimum threshold is met and 100% if the target is met. If the target revenue growth percentage is met, the multiplier increases by increments of 20% for each percentage increase in revenue growth, and is capped at an annual maximum of 200%.
OP Component
        
The OP Component is determined by a formula which measures and rewards improvements in the Companys operating profit. The OP Component is subject to a minimum threshold range for any payout and a multiplier that increases the payout depending on Company performance. For the OP Component, the threshold range of operating profit percentages is subject to a multiplier of 20%, and the multiplier increases by increments of 10% after the top of the threshold range is met. If the target range of operating profit percentage is met, the multiplier is 100%, and thereafter the multiplier increases by increments of 10%, and is capped at a maximum of 200% for each semi-annual measurement period. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, any extraordinary or one-time charges may be excluded for purposes of calculating the OP Component.
Individual Performance Component
For all executive officers other than the CEO, the Individual Performance Component is based on a maximum of ten individual performance goals per semi-annual performance period. The CEOs Individual Performance Component is based on a maximum of ten individual performance goals for the annual performance period. For all executive officers, achievement of each goal is measured on a scale of 0% achievement to 150% achievement. The threshold for any payout of the Individual Performance Component is 50% overall achievement and the maximum performance is capped at 150%.
Named Executive Officer Salary Adjustments
Also on May 15, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the following salary adjustment for fiscal 2014 for the following named executive officer, effective July 1, 2013:
