On a GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was $4.5 million compared to $20.8 million for the same period of fiscal 2002. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $0.02 compared to $0.10 for the same period of fiscal 2002.

Core earnings per share increased 58.3 percent to $0.19 per diluted share for the period, compared to $0.12 for the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
(Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income. The Company reports core earnings to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core earnings to its GAAP net income and additional information in the supplemental information below).
Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 34.3 percent to $112.6 million or 9.2 percent of revenue compared to $83.9 million or 9.9 percent of revenue for the same period of fiscal 2002.

The Company reports core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and additional information in the supplemental information below).
"We were very satisfied with the results of our third fiscal quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of increasing revenue, core operating profits and returns since the technology slowdown. While we are pleased with what we have accomplished, we will continue to focus on increasing operating income and return metrics," said Jabil's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lewis.
 
Q3 2003 Earnings Release  Add One June 18, 2003
Income Statement Highlights
Other Sequential Highlights
Business Outlook Guidance
The Company provided guidance for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 indicating it expects revenue to increase sequentially three to seven percent, in a range of $1.25 to $1.3 billion. Jabil said it expects core operating income to increase sequentially five to ten percent resulting in core earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.21 per diluted share, depending upon exact levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $0.10 to $0.12 per diluted share. The Company indicated its restructuring plan is on track and expects to record a total of $88 million in charges for the fiscal year 2003, including a $12 million charge in the fiscal fourth quarter.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share includes $0.09 per share for amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income.)
"By focusing on growing and diversifying our business, fine tuning our manufacturing operations and global plant sites, we have put up solid results in a very challenging environment. I am extremely pleased with the progress our company and our employees have made in expanding our customer base, growing our relationships with existing customers, refining our operational performance and integrating our newly acquired operations. We anticipate continuing this performance in our fourth fiscal quarter," said Tim Main, Jabil's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Due to its recent acquisitions and restructuring programs, the Company has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Except as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and except as would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy or rule of common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof, including any judicial or administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of human health, the environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, authorizations and approvals required under any applicable Environmental Laws and are each in compliance with their requirements, (iii) there are no pending or threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, demand letters, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (iv) there are no events or circumstances that might reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or any Environmental Laws. 12
(cc) Maintenance of Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act) that (A) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the filings made by the Company with the Commission which it may make under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act are being prepared, (B) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing of the Company's most recent annual report filed with the Commission and (C) are effective to perform the functions for which they were established. The accountants and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company have been advised of (x) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Company's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the accountants; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Any certificate signed by any director or officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company as to the matters covered thereby. SECTION 2. Purchase and Sale. (a) Initial Securities. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein and therein set forth. Offered Securities which are subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Delayed Delivery Offered Securities" and Offered Securities which are not subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Immediate Delivery Offered Securities". (b) Option Securities. In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company may grant, if so provided in the Terms Agreement, an option to the Underwriters named in the Terms Agreement, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to the number or principal amount of Option Securities set forth therein at the same price per security (plus, except as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement, interest, if any, accrued and unpaid from the Closing Time until the applicable Date of Delivery, and less, except as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement, an amount equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and paid or payable on the initial Offered 13
Securities but not payable on the Option Securities), as is applicable to the Offered Securities. Such option, if granted, will expire 30 days after the date of the Terms Agreement, and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time only for the purpose of covering over-allotments which may be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Offered Securities upon notice by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the number or principal amount of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities. Any such time and date of delivery (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than seven full business days and not earlier than two full business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Time, as hereinafter defined, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company. If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Securities, each of the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, will purchase the proportion of the total number or principal amount of Option Securities then being purchased that the number or principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities each such Underwriter has agreed to purchase, as set forth in the Terms Agreement, bears to the total principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives in their discretion shall make to eliminate any sales or purchases in less than authorized denominations or of a fractional number of shares, as the case may be. (c) Payment, Denominations and Registration. Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the place set forth in the Terms Agreement, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on the third business day (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10) following the date of the Terms Agreement or such other time as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company (such time and date being referred to as the "Closing Time"). Except as specified in the Terms Agreement, payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer in same day funds to the account of the Company specified in the Terms Agreement against delivery to the Underwriters for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by them (unless the Offered Securities are issuable only in the form of one or more global securities registered in the name of a depository or a nominee of a depository, in which event the Underwriters' interest in such global securities shall be noted in a manner satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel). In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Securities are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates representing, such Option Securities shall be made at such place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on each Date of Delivery as agreed by the Representatives and the Company. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request in writing at least two business days prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, which if agreed by the Representatives may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by the Representatives on or before the first business day prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. 14
(d) Delayed Delivery Contracts. (i) If authorized by the Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, with such changes therein as the Company may approve. As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to the Representatives at the Closing Time, for the account of the Underwriters, a fee equal to that percentage of the aggregate number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at the Closing Time as is specified in the Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. At the Closing Time the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate number or principal amount of Offered Securities in excess of that specified in the Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. (ii) The Representatives are to submit to the Company, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract. (iii) The number or principal amount of Offered Securities agreed to be purchased by the respective Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by the Underwriters to the Company; provided, however, that the total number or principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the total amount of the Offered Securities covered by this Agreement, less the total number or principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts. SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows: (a) Preparation of Prospectus Supplement. Immediately following the execution of the Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement 15
in form approved by the Representatives setting forth the principal amount of Offered Securities and their terms not otherwise specified in the Indenture, if applicable, the names of the Underwriters and the number or principal amount of the Offered Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters, the price at which the Offered Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, the selling concession and reallowance, if any, any delayed delivery arrangements, and such other information as the Representatives and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives shall reasonably request. (b) Continued Compliance With Securities Laws. If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly amend the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or the 1933 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply with such requirements. (c) Rule 158. The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering each twelve month period beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Offered Securities. (d) Filing of Additional Registration Statements or Amendments. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Debt Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b)) or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise; will furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or use, as the case may be; and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters reasonably object. 16
(e) Compliance with Commission Requests and Notification of Ratings Changes. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will notify the Representatives immediately, and promptly confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (v) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and (vi) any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. (f) Delivery of Registration Statements and Prospectuses. The Company will deliver to each Underwriter one conformed copy of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) and will also deliver to the Representatives as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) as the Representatives may reasonably request. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, the Company will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives reasonably request. (g) Blue Sky Qualifications. The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 17
(h) Compliance with 1934 Act. The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act within the time periods prescribed by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (i) Restriction on Offers and Sales of Securities. If specified in the Terms Agreement, between the date of the Terms Agreement and 90 days after the completion of the distribution of the Offered Securities or the Closing Time, whichever is later, or such other time as is specified in the Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any securities of the Company substantially similar to the Offered Securities (other than the Offered Securities that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement or commercial paper in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise specified in the Terms Agreement). (j) Reservation of Securities. If the applicable Terms Agreement specifies that any related Underlying Securities include Common Stock, Preferred Stock and/or Depositary Shares, the Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive or other similar rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock, as applicable, for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue such Underlying Securities upon exercise of the related Warrants, as applicable, or upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, Senior Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as applicable. (k) Listing. The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities, prior to the Closing Time, on any national securities exchange or quotation system if and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. SECTION 4. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements which the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of all of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and under the Terms Agreement, and to the following further conditions: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement. The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, has become effective under the 1933 Act and, at the Closing Time, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of counsel to the Underwriters. 18
(b) Opinions of Counsel. At the Closing Time, the Underwriters shall have received: (i) Opinion of Counsel for Company. The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Holland & Knight LLP ("H&K"), counsel to the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect as set forth below and to such further effect as counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request: (1) The Company is a corporation incorporated and validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. (2) The Company has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any. (3) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. (4) If applicable, the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Capitalization" (except for subsequent issuances, if any, pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee benefit plans referred to in the Prospectus or pursuant to the exercise of convertible securities or options referred to in the Prospectus); the shares of issued and outstanding capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; to such counsel's knowledge, none of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company was issued in violation of the preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. (5) This Agreement and the applicable Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (6) If the Offered Securities include Common Stock, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. Such Offered Securities, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration therefor specified in this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. No holder of such Offered Securities is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. The form of certificate used to evidence the Offered Securities is in due and proper form and complies 19
with all applicable statutory requirements, with any applicable requirements of the Company's charter and by-laws and with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. (7) If the Offered Securities include Preferred Stock and/or Depositary Shares, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. The applicable Preferred Stock, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration therefor, or for the related Depositary Shares, as the case may be, specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. In addition, upon deposit by the Company of any Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares with the applicable Depositary and the execution and delivery by such Depositary of the Depositary Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares, in each case pursuant to the applicable Deposit Agreement, such Depositary Shares will represent legal and valid interests in such Preferred Stock. No holder of such Preferred Stock or Depositary Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. The applicable Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights will be in full force and effect prior to the Closing Time. The form of certificate used to evidence the Preferred Stock is in due and proper form and complies with all applicable statutory requirements, with any applicable requirements of the Company's charter and by-laws and with the requirements of the exchange or system, if any, on which the Offered Securities are listed or admitted for trading, as the case may be. (8) If the Offered Securities include Depositary Shares or if Debt Securities are convertible into Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock, the applicable Deposit Agreement has been, or prior to the issuance of such Depositary Stock will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the applicable Depositary of the applicable Deposit Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Each registered holder of a Depositary Receipt under the applicable Deposit Agreement will be entitled to the proportional rights, preferences and limitations of the Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Depositary Receipt and to such other rights as are granted to such registered holder in such Deposit Agreement. 20
(9) If the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, or if Preferred Stock is, or Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock are convertible into Debt Securities, each applicable Indenture has been, or prior to the issuance of the Debt Securities thereunder will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming each applicable Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the applicable Trustee) constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Offered Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. (10) If the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, such Offered Securities, have been or as at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized for issuance, offer and sale pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contract and the Indenture against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Offered Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and each holder of Offered Securities will be entitled to the benefits of such Indenture. (11) If the Offered Securities include Warrants, such Offered Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized by the Company for issuance and sale pursuant to this Agreement. Such Offered Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for the applicable Warrant Agreement and delivered against payment of the consideration therefor specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits provided by such Warrant Agreement and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating 21
to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (12) If the Offered Securities include Warrants, each applicable Warrant Agreement has been, or prior to the issuance of such Offered Securities will have been, duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the applicable Warrant Agent of the applicable Warrant Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (13) If the Underlying Securities related to the Offered Securities include Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, such Underlying Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company upon exercise of the Common Stock Warrants or Preferred Stock Warrants, as applicable, or upon conversion of the related Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, Senior Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as applicable. If the Underlying Securities include Common Stock or Preferred Stock, such Underlying Securities, when issued upon such exercise or conversion, as applicable, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. If the Underlying Securities include Depositary Shares, such Underlying Securities, upon deposit by the Company of the Preferred Stock represented thereby with the applicable Depositary and the execution and delivery by such Depositary of the Depositary Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares, in each case pursuant to the applicable Deposit Agreement, will represent legal and valid interests in such Preferred Stock. No holder of such Common Stock, Preferred Stock or Depositary Receipts evidencing Depository Shares is or will be subject to personal liability solely by reason of being such a holder. If the Underlying Securities related to the Offered Securities include Senior Debt Securities and/or Subordinated Debt Securities, such Underlying Securities have been, or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement will have been, duly authorized for issuance by the Company upon the exercise of the Debt Security Warrants or upon conversion of the related Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable. Such Underlying Securities, when issued and authenticated in the manner provided for in the applicable Indenture and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Debt Security Warrants or the related Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, 22
except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by requirements that a claim with respect to any Debt Securities payable in a foreign or composite currency (or a foreign or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or by governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States. (14) The Offered Securities and each applicable Indenture, Deposit Agreement and Warrant Agreement, as of each Representation Date, and any Underlying Securities, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the related Offered Securities, will conform in all material respects to the statements relating thereto contained in the Prospectus and will be in substantially the form filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; and the statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities", insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents specifically referred to therein, are accurate summaries of such provisions. (15) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, has been declared effective under the 1933 Act; any required filing of the Prospectuses pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission. (16) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or any information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b) or Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, as applicable, the Prospectuses, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom and other than those parts of the Registration Statement that constitute the Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (17) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectuses (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they 23
were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations. (18) To such counsel's knowledge and except as described in the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party, or to which the property of the Company or any subsidiary is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if applicable, or any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement, or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. (19) The information in, or incorporated by reference into, the Prospectus under the captions entitled "Facilities", "Legal Proceedings", "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" or any similar caption or captions, if applicable, and in the Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters, the Company's charter and bylaws or legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by such counsel and is correct in all material respects; and, if applicable, the opinion of the firm set forth under "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" or any similar caption, if applicable, is confirmed.

(21) To such counsel's knowledge, no filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations, which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if applicable, or any applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement or Deposit Agreement or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities. (22) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts and each applicable Indenture, Warrant Agreement 24
and Deposit Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and in the Registration Statement (including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities, and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use Of Proceeds" and the issuance of any Underlying Securities) and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and under any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the Indenture do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event under or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to such counsel, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any subsidiary, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or operations. (23) The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act. (24) If the Offered Securities include Debt Securities, the applicable Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). (ii) Opinion of Local Counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman L.P. ("Jabil Circuit Cayman"). The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of local counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect as set forth below and to such further effect as counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request: 25
(1) Jabil Circuit Cayman is duly established as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands. (2) The Company, as general partner of Jabil Circuit Cayman, has corporate power and authority under Cayman Islands law to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct the business of Jabil Circuit Cayman. (3) Except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, all of the issued and outstanding partnership interests of Jabil Circuit Cayman have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and, to such counsel's knowledge, are owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. (4) None of the outstanding partnership interests of Jabil Circuit Cayman were issued in violation of the preemptive or similar rights of any of its partnership interest holders. (5) To such counsel's knowledge, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, to which Jabil Circuit Cayman is a party, or to which the property of Jabil Circuit Cayman is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). (iii) Opinion of Counsel for Underwriters. The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (5), (6) through (9), (10) through (14), (15), (16) and (24) (in each case, as applicable), of subsection (b)(i) of this Section. (iv) In giving their opinions required by subsection (b)(i) and (b)(iii), respectively, of this Section 4, Holland & Knight LLP and Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP shall each additionally state that in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus such counsel has considered the 26
information set forth therein in light of the matters required to be set forth therein, and has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, including its independent public accountants, during the course of which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Such counsel need not independently check the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise verify, and accordingly need not pass upon, and accordingly need not assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (except as set forth in items (14), (19), (20) and (24) of the opinion set forth in subsection (b)(i)). Such counsel shall additionally state that, however, as a result of such consideration and participation, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (or, if an amendment to the Registration Statement or an Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, then at the time such amendment became effective or at the time of the most recent such filing, as the case may be), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the Prospectus was issued at the time any such amendment or supplement was issued, or at the Closing Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief with respect to the financial statements and other financial data contained in the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus) or those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Form T-1). (c) Officer's Certificate. At the Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the chief financial or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 are true and correct as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Company has performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the date of such certificate and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the Commission. As used in this Section 4(c), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the Offered Securities. 27
(d) Accountants' Comfort Letters. (i) On the date of the Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received a letter from KPMG LLP (and each other independent accountants with respect to financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), dated as of the date thereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter for each of the other Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (ii) At the Closing Time, the Underwriters shall have received from KPMG LLP (and each other applicable independent accountants), a letter, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (d)(i) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Time. (e) Approval of Listing. At Closing Time, the Offered Securities shall have been approved for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance, on the securities exchanges, if any, specified in the applicable Terms Agreement. (f) No Objection. If the Registration Statement or an offering of Offered Securities has been filed with the NASD for review, the NASD shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements. (g) Lock-up Agreements. On the date of the applicable Terms Agreement, the Representatives shall have received, in form and substance satisfactory to them, each lock-up agreement, if any, specified in such Terms Agreement as being required to be delivered by the persons listed therein. (h) Additional Documents. At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein and in the Terms Agreement contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives. (i) Conditions to Purchase of Option Securities. In the event that the Terms Agreement provides for Option Securities and the Underwriters exercise their option pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any portion of the Option Securities, the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and the statements in 28
any certificates furnished by the Company hereunder shall be true and correct as of each Date of Delivery, and the Underwriters shall have received: (i) Unless the Date of Delivery is the Closing Time, a certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of the Chief Executive Officer, President or a Vice President and the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer, the principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company, in their capacities as such, confirming that the certificate delivered at the Closing Time pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof remains true and correct as of such Date of Delivery. (ii) The favorable opinion of Holland & Knight LLP, counsel for the Company and local counsel for Jabil Circuit Cayman, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and otherwise substantially to the same effect as the opinions required by subsections (i) and (ii) of Section 4(b) hereof. (iii) The favorable opinion of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and otherwise to the same effect as the opinion required by subsection (iii) to Section 4(b) hereof. (iv) Unless the Date of Delivery is the Closing Time, a letter from KPMG LLP (and each other applicable independent accountants), in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and dated such Date of Delivery, substantially the same in scope and substance as the letter furnished to the Underwriters at the Closing Time pursuant to Section 4(d) hereof, except that the "specified date" in the letter shall be a date not more than three days prior to such Date of Delivery. If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 5. SECTION 5. Payment of Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (a) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, and all amendments thereto and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (b) the preparation, filing and reproduction of this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contract(s), if applicable; (c) the preparation, printing, issuance and delivery of the Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities, including any fees and expenses relating to the eligibility and issuance of Offered Securities and any related Underlying Securities in book-entry form; 29

If this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters in accordance with the provisions of Section 9, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters. SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: 30
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, including information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b) or Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and expenses of counsel chosen by such Underwriter), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above. provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter with respect to any preliminary prospectus to the extent that the Company shall sustain the burden of proving that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense resulted from the fact that such Underwriter, in contravention of a requirement of applicable law, sold Offered Securities to a person to whom such Underwriter failed to send or give, at or prior to the Closing Time, a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) if (i) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof (sufficiently in advance of the Closing Time and in sufficient quantity to allow for distribution by the Closing Time) to the Underwriters and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Underwriter resulted from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from the preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) prior to 31
the Closing Time and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person and (ii) such failure to give or send such Prospectus by the Closing Time to the party or parties asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have constituted the sole defense to the claim asserted by such person. (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for the fees and expenses of counsel which the 32
indemnifying party is required to pay pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) and Section 6(b) hereof, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party as required hereunder in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. (e) For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof, including, without limitation, any copies filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total commission or underwriting discount received by each Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation 33
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Securities sold to or through each Underwriter and not joint. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person of an Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any Offered Securities. SECTION 9. Termination. (a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to 34
market the Offered Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Offered Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or in Europe, or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign currency or currencies in which the Offered Securities are denominated or payable, or (iv) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of the Terms Agreement shall have been lowered since that date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (v) there shall have come to the attention of the Representatives any facts that would cause them to reasonably believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Offered Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section 9, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the related Offered Securities. (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except to the extent provided in Section 5. Notwithstanding any such termination, (i) the covenants set forth in Section 3(b), (d), and (e) with respect to any offering of Offered Securities shall remain in effect so long as any Underwriter owns any such Offered Securities purchased from the Company pursuant to this Agreement and during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities and (ii) the covenants set forth in Section 3(c), (g), (h) and, if applicable, (i), the provisions of Section 5, the indemnity agreement set forth in Section 6, the contribution provisions set forth in Section 7 and the provisions of Sections 8, 11, 12 and 13 shall remain in effect. SECTION 10. Default. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or a Date of Delivery to purchase the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms 35
herein set forth. If, however, during such 24 hours the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Securities, then: (a) if the amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement or, with respect to any Date of Delivery which occurs after the Closing Time, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Option Securities to be purchased and sold on such Date of Delivery shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement or, in the case of a Date of Delivery which is after the Closing Time, which does not result in a termination of the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities, as the case may be, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10. SECTION 11. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing, either delivered by hand, by mail or by telex, telecopier or telegram, and any such notice shall be effective when received at the address specified in this Section 11. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed as provided in the Terms Agreement. Notices to the Company shall be directed to it at 10560 Dr. Martin Luther King Street North, St. Petersburg, Florida 33716, attention of General Counsel. Any party to this Agreement may from time to time designate another address to receive notice pursuant to this Agreement by notice duly given in accordance with the terms of this Section 11. SECTION 12. Parties. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and 36
legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of Offered Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. SECTION 13. Governing Law. This Agreement and all the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in such State. SECTION 14. Counterparts.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting.

If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act shall be valid or effective if made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date. (2) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing referred to in this Section 1.4 may be proved in any reasonable manner; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section. (3) The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Registered Securities held by any Person, and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (a) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (b) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, (c) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (d) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by the Person so executing such instrument or writing and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Company and the Trustee deem sufficient. 15
(5) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of any Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may at its option (but is not obligated to), by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Securities entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of Registered Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders of Registered Securities shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. (6) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such Act is made upon such Security.

Section 1.6. Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, (1) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Registered Securities if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Registered Security affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice; and 16
(2) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Bearer Securities, if any, if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and, if such Securities are then listed on any stock exchange outside the United States, in an Authorized Newspaper in such city as the Company shall advise the Trustee that such stock exchange so requires, on a Business Day at least twice, the first such publication to be not earlier than the earliest date and the second such publication not later than the latest date prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Registered Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given or provided. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification shall be made by overnight courier. In case by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice mailed to Holders of Registered Securities as provided above. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. Section 1.7. Language of Notices. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that, if the Company so elects, any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication. Section 1.8. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with any duties under any required provision of the Trust Indenture Act imposed hereon by Section 318(c) thereof, such required provision shall control.

If Securities of a series shall be issuable in global form, any such Security may provide that it or any number of such Securities shall represent the aggregate amount of all Outstanding Securities of such series (or such lesser amount as is permitted by the terms thereof) from time to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be increased or reduced to reflect exchanges.

All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise so provided, a series may be reopened for issuances of additional Securities of such series or to establish additional terms of such series of Securities. If any of the terms of the Securities of any series shall be established by action taken by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, the Board Resolution shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of such series. Section 3.2. Currency; Denominations. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the principal of, any premium and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities shall be payable in Dollars. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, Registered Securities denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in registered form without Coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and the Bearer Securities denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in the denomination of $5,000. Securities not denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in such denominations as are established with respect to such Securities in or pursuant to this Indenture. Section 3.3. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its President, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. Coupons shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer or one of the Vice Presidents of the Company. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities or any Coupons appertaining thereto may be manual or facsimile. Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons or did not hold such offices at the date of original issuance of such Securities or Coupons. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company, to the Trustee for authentication and, provided that the Board Resolution and Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture or indentures with respect to such Securities referred to in Section 3.1 and a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities have been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order and subject to the provisions hereof and of such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, or make available for delivery, such Securities. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities and any Coupons 25
appertaining thereto, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Sections 315(a) through 315(d) of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, (1) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that: (a) the form or forms and terms of such Securities and Coupons, if any, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (b) all conditions precedent to the authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, have been complied with and that such Securities and Coupons, when completed by appropriate insertions and attested by duly authorized officers of the Company, delivered by duly authorized officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication pursuant to this Indenture, and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and will entitle the Holders thereof to the benefits of this Indenture; such Opinion of Counsel need express no opinion as to the availability of equitable remedies; (c) all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities and Coupons, if any, have been complied with; (d) this Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and (e) the Indenture and or Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and (assuming this Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee) constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equity principles, and further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgement in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States; and (2) an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution, authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, have been complied with and that, to the best knowledge of the Persons executing such certificate, no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time would become, an Event of Default with respect to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing. 26
If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such opinion and certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series. After any such first delivery, any separate written request by an Authorized Officer of the Company that the Trustee authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue will be deemed to be a certification by the Company that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to authentication and delivery of such Securities continue to have been complied with. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate or to cause an Authenticating Agent to authenticate any Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken. Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security and any Bearer Security in global form shall be dated as of the date specified in or pursuant to this Indenture. No Security or Coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for in Section 2.2 or 6.11 executed by or on behalf of the Trustee or by the Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. Such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Except as permitted by Section 3.6 or 3.7, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons appertaining thereto then matured have been detached and cancelled. Section 3.4. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and deliver to the Trustee and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner provided in Section 3.3, temporary Securities in lieu thereof which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Such temporary Securities may be in global form. Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of the same series and containing terms and provisions that are identical to those of any temporary Securities, such temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at an Office or Agency for such Securities, without charge to any Holder thereof. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or 27
more temporary Securities (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and containing identical terms and provisions; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security, except as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in or pursuant to this Indenture. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to a temporary global Security, until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series. Section 3.5. Registration, Transfer and Exchange. With respect to the Registered Securities of each series, if any, the Company shall cause to be kept a register (each such register being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") at an Office or Agency for such series in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Registered Securities of such series and of transfers of the Registered Securities of such series. Such Office or Agency shall be the "Security Registrar" for that series of Securities. Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities, the Trustee shall be the initial Security Registrar for each series of Securities. The Company shall have the right to remove and replace from time to time the Security Registrar for any series of Securities; provided that no such removal or replacement shall be effective until a successor Security Registrar with respect to such series of Securities shall have been appointed by the Company and shall have accepted such appointment by the Company. In the event that the Trustee shall not be or shall cease to be Security Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register for such series at all reasonable times. There shall be only one Security Register for each series of Securities. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any Office or Agency for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions. At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered 28
Securities of such series containing identical terms, denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture and in the same aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such series located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such Office or Agency for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series and like tenor after the close of business at such Office or Agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Bearer Securities upon such terms and conditions as may be provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to such series. Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange as contemplated by the immediately preceding two paragraphs, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any global Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities only if (i) the Depository is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that such global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. If the beneficial owners of interests in a global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities as the result of 29
an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in such form and denominations as are required by or pursuant to this Indenture, and of the same series, containing identical terms and in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such global Security shall be surrendered from time to time by the U.S. Depository or such other Depository as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, and in accordance with instructions given to the Trustee and the U.S. Depository or such other Depository, as the case may be (which instructions shall be in writing but need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate or be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive Securities as described above without charge. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for each portion of such surrendered global Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such global Security to be exchanged, which (unless such Securities are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof, but subject to the satisfaction of any certification or other requirements to the issuance of Bearer Securities; provided, however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of the same series to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and provided, further, that (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such global Security shall be returned by the Trustee to such Depository or the U.S. Depository, as the case may be, or such other Depository or U.S. Depository referred to above in accordance with the instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a global Security after the close of business at the Office or Agency for such Security where such exchange occurs on or after (i) any Regular Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related proposed date for payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such global Security shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and entitling the Holders thereof to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 30
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such Security duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of any notice of redemption of Securities of like tenor and the same series under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such selection, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except, to the extent provided with respect to such Bearer Security, that such Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of like tenor and the same series, provided that such Registered Security shall be immediately surrendered for redemption with written instruction for payment consistent with the provisions of this Indenture or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which, in accordance with its terms, has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid. Section 3.6. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.6, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security. If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains with all appurtenant Coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen, a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains. 31
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6, in case any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or Coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, be payable only at an Office or Agency for such Securities located outside the United States and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on Bearer Securities and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 3.6, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security, with any Coupons appertaining thereto issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains shall constitute a separate obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and Coupons appertaining thereto or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series and any Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section 3.6, as amended or supplemented pursuant to this Indenture with respect to particular Securities or generally, shall be exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons. Section 3.7. Payment of Interest and Certain Additional Amounts; Rights to Interest and Certain Additional Amounts Preserved. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, and are punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, but shall not be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Registered Security (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be 32
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed by the Company in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on such Registered Security, the Special Record Date therefor and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Person entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. The Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after notification to the Trustee of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall in the name and at the expense of the Company cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holder of such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee shall, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of any particular series pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, at the option of the Company, interest on Registered Securities that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in the United States. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. In the case of any Registered Security of any series that is convertible into shares of Common Stock or exchangeable for other securities, which Registered Security is converted or exchanged after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Registered Security with respect to which the Stated Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such 33
conversion or exchange, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Registered Security (or one or more predecessor Registered Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Registered Security which is converted or exchanged, interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion or exchange of such Registered Security shall not be payable. Section 3.8. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered in the Security Register as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, any premium and (subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.7) interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Registered Security shall be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security or the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or Coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such Security or Coupon shall be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. No Holder of any beneficial interest in any global Security held on its behalf by a Depository shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such global Security, and such Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Section 3.9. Cancellation. All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer, exchange or conversion or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and Coupons, as well as Securities and Coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose, shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or pursuant to this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and Coupons held by the 34
Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its customary manner, unless by a Company Order the Company directs their return to it. Section 3.10. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or in any Security, interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Section 3.11. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing Securities may obtain CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use) or other identifying numbers, and, if so obtained, the Trustee shall use such numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or other identifying numbers. ARTICLE 4 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE Section 4.1. Satisfaction and Discharge. Upon the direction of the Company by a Company Order, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Order and any Coupons appertaining thereto, and the Trustee, on receipt of a Company Order, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series, when (1) either (a) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered and all Coupons appertaining thereto (other than (i) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such series surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities of such series and maturing after such exchange whose surrender is not required or has been waived as provided in Section 3.5, (ii) Securities and Coupons of such series which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6, (iii) Coupons appertaining to Securities of such series called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date whose surrender has been waived as provided in Section 11.6, and (iv) Securities and Coupons of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Securities of such series and, in the case of (i) or (ii) below, any Coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation 35
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Company, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose, money in the Currency in which such Securities are payable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Maturity thereof, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with. In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of such series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any series of Securities, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.6 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series under Sections 3.5, 3.6, 4.3, 10.2 and 10.3, with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 10.4 (but only to the extent that the Additional Amounts payable with respect to such Securities exceed the amount deposited in respect of such Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 4.1(1)(b)), and with respect to any rights to convert or exchange such Securities into Common Stock or other securities shall survive. Section 4.2. Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. (1) Unless pursuant to Section 3.1, either or both of (i) defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under clause (2) of this Section 4.2 shall not be applicable with respect to the Securities of such series or (ii) covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under clause (3) of this Section 4.2 shall not be applicable with respect to the Securities of such series, then such provisions, together with the other provisions of this Section 4.2 (with 36
such modifications thereto as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to any Securities), shall be applicable to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have Section 4.2(2) or Section 4.2(3) be applied to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Section 4.2. (2) Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section 4.2(2) with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of clause (5) of this Section 4.2 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 and as more fully set forth in such clause, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on, and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto when such payments are due, and any rights of such Holder to convert such Securities into Common Stock or exchange such Securities for other securities, (ii) the obligations of the Company and the Trustee with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.5, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3 and with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by Section 10.4 (but only to the extent that the Additional Amounts payable with respect to such Securities exceed the amount deposited in respect of such Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) below), and with respect to any rights to convert such Securities into Common Stock or exchange such Securities for other securities, (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (iv) this Section 4.2. The Company may exercise its option under this Section 4.2(2) notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under clause (3) of this Section 4.2 with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. (3) Upon the Company's exercise of the option to have this Section 4.2(3) apply with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, and, to the extent specified pursuant to Section 3.1(19), any other covenant applicable to such Securities, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with any such covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant 37
defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with, and shall have no liability in respect of, any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 5.1(4) or 5.1(9) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby. (4) The following shall be the conditions to application of clause (2) or (3) of this Section 4.2 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto: (a) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 6.7 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.2 applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, (1) an amount in Dollars or in such Foreign Currency in which such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are then specified as payable at Stated Maturity, or (2) Government Obligations applicable to such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto (determined on the basis of the Currency in which such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto are then specified as payable at Stated Maturity) which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, money in an amount, or (3) a combination thereof, in any case, in an amount, sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal and interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, (y) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto at the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or premium or interest and (z) any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto on the days on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. (b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and, with respect to defeasance only, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date 38
of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period). (d) In the case of an election under clause (2) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a letter ruling, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service a Revenue Ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred. (e) In the case of an election under clause (3) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred. (f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, after the 123rd day after the date of deposit, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) pursuant to this clause (4) to be held in trust will not be subject to any case or proceeding (whether voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Company under any Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or any decree or order for relief in respect of the Company issued in connection therewith. (g) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance or covenant defeasance under clause (2) or (3) of this Section 4.2 (as the case may be) have been complied with. (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 4.2(4), such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.1. (5) Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or any Security, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made, (a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 3.1 or the terms of such Security to receive payment in a Currency other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made in respect of such Security, or (b) a Conversion Event occurs in respect of the Foreign Currency in which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.2(4)(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such Security and any Coupons 39
appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any), and interest, if any, on, and Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, such Security as the same becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below in the case of any such election) the amount or other property deposited in respect of such Security into the Currency in which such Security becomes payable as a result of such election or Conversion Event based on (x) in the case of payments made pursuant to clause (a) above, the applicable market exchange rate for such Currency in effect on the second Business Day prior to each payment date, or (y) with respect to a Conversion Event, the applicable market exchange rate for such Foreign Currency in effect (as nearly as feasible) at the time of the Conversion Event. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 4.2(5) and Section 4.3, the "Trustee") against any tax, fee or other charge, imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to this Section 4.2 or the principal or interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. Anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in clause (4) of this Section 4.2 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 4.2. Section 4.3. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities, and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any; but such money and Government Obligations need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 40

(6) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall fail within 30 days to pay, bond or otherwise discharge uninsured judgments or court orders for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate, which are not stayed on appeal or are not otherwise being appropriately contested in good faith; or (7) the entry by a court having competent jurisdiction of: (a) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an involuntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (b) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (c) a final and non-appealable order appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee or other similar official of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or of any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (8) the commencement by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of a voluntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of a voluntary proceeding seeking to be adjudicated insolvent or the consent by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the entry of a decree or order for relief in an involuntary proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or relief under any applicable law, or the consent by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee or similar official of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any substantial part of the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the making by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the taking of corporate action by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in furtherance of any such action; or (9) any other Event of Default provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series. Section 5.2. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 5.1) occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal of all the 42
Securities of such series, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal or such lesser amount shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 5.1 occurs, all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of the Outstanding Securities of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series) shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of any Security of that series. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum of money sufficient to pay (a) all overdue installments of any interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to all Securities of such series and any Coupon appertaining thereto, (b) the principal of and any premium on any Securities of such series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon and any Additional Amounts with respect thereto at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, (c) to the extent that payment of such interest or Additional Amounts is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of any interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and (d) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.6; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.3. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if 43
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto when such interest or Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security or any Additional Amounts with respect thereto at their Maturity, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the whole amount of money then due and payable with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, with interest upon the overdue principal, any premium and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest and Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount of money as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6. If the Company fails to pay the money it is required to pay the Trustee pursuant to the preceding paragraph forthwith upon the demand of the Trustee, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the money so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and collect the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or such Securities or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 5.4. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series or the property of the Company or such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any overdue principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, 44
(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of any applicable series, of the principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents or counsel) and of the Holders of Securities or any Coupons appertaining thereto allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (2) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities or any Coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities or any Coupons, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.6. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or Coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or any Coupon in any such proceeding. Section 5.5. Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities or Coupons. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the Securities or Coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery or judgment, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, shall be for the ratable benefit of each and every Holder of the Securities or Coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. Section 5.6. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal, or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts, upon presentation of the Securities or Coupons, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.6; 45
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities and any Coupons for principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on such Securities and Coupons for principal and any premium, interest and Additional Amounts, respectively; and THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled thereto. Section 5.7. Limitations on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series or any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as is reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture or any Security to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holders or Holders of Securities of any other series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. Section 5.8. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and any Premium, Interest and Additional Amounts. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security or Coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, any premium and (subject to Sections 3.5 and 3.7) interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to such Security or payment of such Coupon, as the case may be, on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities therefor specified in such Security or Coupon (or, in the 46
case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of such Holder if provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, on the date such repayment is due) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. Section 5.9. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or a Coupon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and each such Holder shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and each such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. Section 5.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons in the last paragraph of Section 3.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to each and every Holder of a Security or a Coupon is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy, to the extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not, to the extent permitted by law, prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Section 5.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or Coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to any Holder of a Security or a Coupon may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by such Holder, as the case may be. Section 5.12. Control by Holders of Securities. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or with the Securities of such series, (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and 47
(3) such direction is not unduly prejudicial to the rights of the other Holders of Securities of such series not joining in such action. Section 5.13. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on, or any Additional Amounts with respect to, any Security of such series or any Coupons appertaining thereto, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 9 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.14. Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants that (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company expressly waives (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. Section 5.15. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of any undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.15 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after 48
the Redemption Date, and, in the case of repayment, on or after the date for repayment) or for the enforcement of the right, if any, to convert or exchange any Security into Common Stock or other securities in accordance with its terms.

(4) If at any time: (a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the obligations imposed upon it under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to Securities of any series after written request therefor by the Company or any Holder of a Security of such series who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months, or (b) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.7 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or any such Holder, or (c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or the Securities of such series, or (ii) subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities of such series and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (5) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of such series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more 53
or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.9.

(1) Upon the appointment hereunder of any successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties hereunder of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or such successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of its charges, shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and, subject to Section 10.3, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section 6.6.

In case any Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered by the Trustee then 55
in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. Section 6.11. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents acceptable to the Company with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of that or those series issued upon original issue, exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption or partial repayment or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any Corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such Corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall (i) mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Registered Securities, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent shall serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, and (ii) if Securities of the series are issued as Bearer Securities, publish notice of such appointment at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the place where such successor Authenticating Agent has its principal office if such office is located outside the United States. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall 56
become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. The Company agrees to pay each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. The provisions of Sections 3.8, 6.3 and 6.4 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent. If an Authenticating Agent is appointed with respect to one or more series of Securities pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in substantially the following form: This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee By_______________________________, as Authenticating Agent By_______________________________, Authorized Officer If all of the Securities of any series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested in writing (which writing need not be accompanied by or contained in an Officers' Certificate by the Company), shall appoint in accordance with this Section an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Securities. Section 6.12. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon 57
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, determined as provided in Section 1.1, 1.4 and 5.12 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. 58

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which shall have been included expressly and solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders of Securities under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. Section 9.3. Execution of Supplemental Indentures. As a condition to executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trust created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent to the execution of such supplemental indenture have been fulfilled. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. 66
Section 9.4. Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of a Security theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder and of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall be bound thereby. Section 9.5. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures. Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. Section 9.6. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect. Section 9.7. Notice of Supplemental Indenture. Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 9.2, the Company shall transmit to the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series affected thereby a notice setting forth the substance of such supplemental indenture. ARTICLE 10 COVENANTS Section 10.1. Payment of Principal, any Premium, Interest and Additional Amounts. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of each series that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of, any premium and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series in accordance with the terms thereof, any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. Any interest due on any Bearer Security on or before the Maturity thereof, and any Additional Amounts payable with respect to such interest, shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto for such interest as they severally mature. Section 10.2. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an Office or Agency where Securities of such series (but not Bearer Securities, except as otherwise provided below, unless such Place of Payment is located outside the United States) may be 67
presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of such series that are convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series relating thereto and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the Company shall maintain, subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, an Office or Agency in a Place of Payment for such series which is located outside the United States where Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented and surrendered for payment; provided, however, that if the Securities of such series are listed on The Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company shall maintain a Paying Agent in London, Luxembourg or any other required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of such series are listed on such exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such Office or Agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Office or Agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of such series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented and surrendered for payment at the place specified for the purpose with respect to such Securities as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, no payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts with respect to Bearer Securities shall be made at any Office or Agency in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, if amounts owing with respect to any Bearer Securities shall be payable in Dollars, payment of principal of, any premium or interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any such Security may be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or any Office or Agency designated by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if (but only if) payment of the full amount of such principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts at all offices outside the United States maintained for such purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other Offices or Agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an Office or Agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other Office or Agency. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company hereby designates as the Place of Payment for each series of Securities the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and initially appoints the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as the Office or Agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for such purpose. The Company 68
may subsequently appoint a different Office or Agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for the Securities of any series. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 3.1, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a Foreign Currency or (ii) may be payable in a Foreign Currency, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, at least one exchange rate agent. Section 10.3. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of, any premium or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the Currency or currencies, Currency unit or units or composite Currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and shall promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it shall, on or prior to each due date of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities of such series, deposit with any Paying Agent a sum (in the Currency or currencies, Currency unit or units or composite Currency or currencies described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company shall cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall: (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of such series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture; (2) give the Trustee written notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series) in the making of any payment of principal, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of such series; and (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent. 69
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums. Except as otherwise provided herein or pursuant hereto, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of any series or any Coupon appertaining thereto and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or any such premium or interest or any such Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall, at the request and expense of the Company, cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment for such series or to be mailed to Holders of Registered Securities of such series, or both, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication or mailing nor shall it be later than two years after such principal and any premium or interest or Additional Amounts shall have become due and payable, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. Section 10.4. Additional Amounts. If any Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company agrees to pay to the Holder of any such Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto Additional Amounts as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or such Securities. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or any Coupon or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided by the terms of such series established hereby or pursuant hereto to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms, and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provision hereof shall not be construed as excluding the payment of Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of the applicable series, if the Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to such series of Securities (or if the Securities of such series shall not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned 70
Officers' Certificate, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and the principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of and premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such series shall be made to Holders of Securities of such series or the Coupons appertaining thereto who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of such series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities or Coupons, and the Company agrees to pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants to fully indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section. Section 10.5. Limitations upon Liens. (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee any Indebtedness secured by any Lien on any property (including shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness) or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, including, without limitation, Indebtedness under the Credit Facility, without in any such case effectively providing concurrently with the creation, incurrence, issuance, assumption or Guarantee of such Indebtedness or the grant of any Lien with respect to such Indebtedness that all Securities Outstanding at such time (together with, if the Company so determines, any other Indebtedness of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not subordinate to the Securities Outstanding at such time) will be secured by any such Lien equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured Indebtedness, so long as such secured Indebtedness is so secured. Provided, however, that in the case of the Credit Facility, such obligation will arise concurrently with the grant of any Lien thereunder, whether or not any Indebtedness shall be outstanding under the Credit Facility at such time. Except in the case of any Lien granted under the Credit Facility, the foregoing restrictions will not, however, apply to Indebtedness secured by: (i) Liens on property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary existing on the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities, (ii) Liens on property or assets of any Person existing prior to the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is, through one or a series of transactions, merged with or into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties of a Person as an entirety, through one or a series of transactions, or substantially as an entirety, through one or a series of transactions, to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or arising thereafter pursuant to contractual commitments entered into prior to and not in contemplation of such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and not in contemplation of any such merger or consolidation or any such sale, lease or other 71
disposition; provided that such Liens shall not extend to any other property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) Liens on property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary existing at the time of acquisition thereof (including acquisition through merger or consolidation); provided that such Liens were in existence prior to and were not created in contemplation of such acquisition and shall not extend to any other property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iv) Liens on property (including in the case of a plant or facility, the land on which it is erected and fixtures comprising a part thereof) or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary securing the payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or the cost of development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement of all or any part thereof, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed prior to, at the time of or within 180 days after, the acquisition of such property or assets or the completion of any such development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement, whichever is later, for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or such cost (provided, in the case of Liens securing the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed for the purposes of financing all or any part of such purchase price, such Liens are limited to the property or assets then being acquired and fixed improvements thereon and the Capital Stock of any person formed to acquire such property or assets, and, provided further, that in the case of Liens securing the payment of all or any part of the cost of development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement of any property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, or securing any Indebtedness created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of such cost, such Liens are limited to the assets or property then being developed, constructed, altered, repaired or improved and the land on which such property is erected and fixtures comprising a part thereof), (v) Liens which secure Indebtedness owing by a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary, (vi) Liens on the property of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United States of America or any State thereof, or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or any State thereof, or in favor of any other country, or any department, agency, or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof, in each case (a) securing partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute, (b) securing indebtedness incurred to finance all or any part of the purchase price or cost of constructing, installing or improving the property subject to such mortgages including mortgages to secure Indebtedness of the pollution control or industrial revenue bond type, or (c) securing indebtedness issued or Guaranteed by the United States of America, any State, any foreign country or any 72
department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of any such jurisdiction, (vii) statutory or common law landlords', carriers', warehouseman's, mechanics', suppliers', materialmens', repairmen's, or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business and with respect to amounts not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate legal proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and, in the latter case, for which a reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been made, (viii) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith by appropriate legal proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and, in the latter case, for which adequate reserves or other appropriate provisions are being maintained, to the extent required by GAAP, (ix) zoning restrictions, easements or minor defects or irregularities in title and other similar charges or encumbrances on property not interfering in any material respect with the use of such property by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (x) customary deposit or reserve arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions, (xi) Liens that are within the general parameters customary in the industry and incurred in the ordinary course of business securing Indebtedness under any Interest Rate Agreement or Currency Agreement designed solely to protect the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from fluctuations in interest rates, currencies or the price of commodities, (xii) Liens incurred (a) in connection with workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and other types of statutory obligations or the requirements of any official body, including for the obtaining of licenses useful in the operation of business, or (b) to secure the performance of Surety Obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with industry practice or appeal bonds, or (c) to secure performance of leases, construction, sales or servicing contracts, supply or consignment contracts, and similar obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, in each case not incurred or made in connection with the borrowing of money, or (d) to secure obligations in respect of customs, duties, excise taxes, value-added taxes, rents, or goods or services (including utility services) provided to such person by governmental entities or suppliers, other similar items which under GAAP constitute operating expense, or (e) to obtain or secure obligations with respect to letters of credit, Guarantees, bonds or other sureties or assurances given in connection with the activities described in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, in each case not incurred or made in connection with 73
the borrowing of money, the obtaining of advances or credit or the payment of the deferred purchase price of property or services, (xiii) Liens on receivables incurred in connection with a Permitted Receivables Transaction; (xiv) judgment Liens against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not giving rise to an Event of Default, (xv) Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount outstanding from time to time of no more than $50,000,000 arising in connection with (a) "synthetic leases" or "tax retention operating leases" and (b) Capitalized Lease Obligations of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; (xvi) Liens arising in connection with the administration and operation of deposit accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operated and maintained outside of the United States of America in connection with cross-border, multiple currency cash pooling arrangements, including overdraft facilities; provided, however that such Liens shall not extent beyond the amounts on deposit therein; and (xvii) any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements), in whole or in part, of any of the Liens referred to in paragraphs (i) through (xvi) above or the Indebtedness secured thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may create, incur, issue or assume Indebtedness secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions if the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness secured by Liens on property or assets of the Company and of any Restricted Subsidiary then outstanding (not including any such Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted to be incurred pursuant to paragraphs (i) through (xvii) above) plus Attributable Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Sale and Leaseback Transactions that would otherwise be subject to the restrictions in Section 10.6 does not at the time such Indebtedness is incurred exceed an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; provided, however, that the foregoing exception does not apply to limit the right of Holders to be secured equally and ratably with the Lenders under the Credit Facility with regard to any collateral from time to time pledged pursuant to the Credit Facility. Holders not so secured will be secured equally and ratably by any Lien only to the extent that it is not otherwise permitted under paragraphs (i) through (xvii) above or to the extent the 10% limitation referred to above is exceeded. (b) For the purposes of clause (a) above, the giving of a Guarantee which is secured by a Lien and the creation of a Lien to secure Indebtedness which existed prior to the creation of such Lien, will be deemed to involve the creation of Indebtedness in an amount equal to the principal amount Guaranteed or secured by such Lien; but the amount of Indebtedness secured by Liens will be computed without cumulating the underlying Indebtedness with any Guarantee thereof or Lien securing the same. 74
(c) For the purposes of determining compliance with this Section 10.5, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in clause (a) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the items of clause (a) above may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above. Section 10.6. Limitations upon Sales and Leasebacks. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement after the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities with any bank, insurance company or other lender or investor (other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) providing for the leasing by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary of any property or assets for a period of more than three years (other than pursuant to so-called synthetic lease or tax retention operating lease transactions), which property or assets were or are owned or leased by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and which have been or are to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to such lender or investor or to any Person to whom funds have been or are to be advanced by such lender or investor on the security of such property or assets (herein referred to as a "Sale and Leaseback Transaction") unless either: (i) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.5, to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such property or assets in a principal amount equal to or exceeding the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction without equally and ratably securing the applicable series of Securities; or (ii) the Company, within 180 days after the sale or transfer, applies or causes a Restricted Subsidiary to apply an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of such sale or transfer or the fair value of such property at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction (as determined by any two of the following: the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer and the Controller of the Company) to the retirement of Securities or other Funded Debts of the Company (other than Funded Debt subordinated to the Securities) or Funded Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that the amount to be so applied shall be reduced by (a) the principal amount of Securities delivered within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation, and (b) the principal amount of any such Funded Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, other than Securities, voluntarily retired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary within 180 days after such sale or transfer to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation, excluding in the case of both (a) and (b), retirement pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund payment or any mandatory prepayment provision or by payment at maturity. 75
Section 10.7. Restrictions on Funded Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee any Funded Debt. This restriction will not apply if: (i) The Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could create Indebtedness secured by Liens in accordance with one or more of clauses (i) through (xvii) of Section 10.5 (a) (whether or not such Indebtedness is in fact secured by Liens) or enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction in accordance with Section 10.6 in an amount equal to such Funded Debt, without equally and ratably securing the Securities, (ii) such Funded Debt existed on the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Securities or such other date as may be specified for an applicable series of Securities, (iii) such Funded Debt is owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (iv) such Funded Debt existed at the time the Person that issued such Funded Debt became a Restricted Subsidiary, or was, through one or a series of transactions, merged with or into or consolidated with such Restricted Subsidiary, or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition, through one or a series of transactions, of the properties of such Person as an entirety to such Restricted Subsidiary, or arising thereafter (a) otherwise than in connection with the borrowing of money arranged thereafter and (b) pursuant to contractual commitments entered into prior to and not in contemplation of such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and not in contemplation of any such merger or consolidation or any such sale, lease or other disposition, (v) such Funded Debt is Guaranteed by the Company, (vi) such Funded Debt is Guaranteed by a governmental agency, (vii) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or Guaranteed in connection with, or with a view to, compliance by such Restricted Subsidiary with the requirements of any program adopted by any federal, state or local governmental authority and applicable to such Restricted Subsidiary and providing financial or tax benefits to such Restricted Subsidiary which are not available directly to the Company, (viii) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or Guaranteed to pay all or any part of the purchase price or the construction cost of property or equipment acquired or constructed by a Restricted Subsidiary, provided such Funded Debt is incurred within 180 days after acquisition, completion of construction or commencement of full operation of such property, whichever is later, and, provided further, that 76
the principal amount of such Funded Debt does not exceed 100% of the fair market value of the property or equipment acquired or constructed, (ix) such Funded Debt is nonrecourse, or (x) such Funded Debt is incurred for the purpose of extending, renewing, substituting, replacing or refunding Funded Debt permitted by the foregoing clauses (i) through (ix). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Restricted Subsidiary may create, incur, issue, assume or Guarantee Funded Debt which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions in an aggregate principal amount which, together with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all other Funded Debt of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including Funded Debt permitted to be incurred pursuant to clauses (i) through (x) above), does not at the time such Funded Debt is incurred exceed an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that any item of Funded Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Funded Debt and only be required to include the amount and type of such Funded Debt in one of the above clauses or the immediately preceding paragraph, and an item of Funded Debt may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above. Section 10.8. Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees by Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any of its Indebtedness ("Guaranteed Indebtedness"), unless (i) such Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture hereto providing for a Guarantee (a "Subsidiary Guarantee") of payment of the Securities of each series by such Subsidiary and (ii) such Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the company or any other Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee; provided that this paragraph shall not be applicable to any Guarantee of any Subsidiary that existed at the time such person became a Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such person becoming a Subsidiary. If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is (A) pari passu with the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be pari passu with, or subordinated to, the Subsidiary Guarantee or (B) subordinated to the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary may provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any person not an affiliate of the Company, of all of its and each other Subsidiary's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited hereby) or (ii) the release or discharge of the 77
Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee. Section 10.9. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article Eight, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries and the rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not obligate the Company to preserve the existence of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to any Holder. Section 10.10. Waiver of Certain Covenants. The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.5 through 10.9, inclusive, with respect to the Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, by Act of such Holders, either shall waive such compliance in such instance or generally shall have waived compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. Section 10.11. Company Statement as to Compliance; Notice of Certain Defaults. (1) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a written statement (which need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate) signed by the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer of the Company, stating that (a) a review of the activities of the Company during such year and of its performance under this Indenture has been made under his or her supervision, and (b) to the best of his or her knowledge, based on such review, (a) the Company has complied with all the conditions and covenants imposed on it under this Indenture throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such condition or covenant, specifying each such default known to him or her and the nature and status thereof, and (b) no event has occurred and is continuing which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default, or, if such an event has occurred and is continuing, specifying each such event known to him and the nature and status thereof. (2) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within five days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Event of Default or any event which after notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) of Section 5.1. 78
Section 10.12. Calculation of Original Issue Discount. The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount of any Original Issue Discount Security (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. ARTICLE 11 REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES Section 11.1. Applicability of Article. Redemption of Securities of any series at the option of the Company as permitted or required by the terms of such Securities shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise provided herein or pursuant hereto) this Article. Section 11.2. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of (a) less than all of the Securities of any series; (b) all of the Securities of any series, with the same issue date, interest rate or formula, Stated Maturity and other terms or (c) any other instances, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. Section 11.3. Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed. If less than all of the Securities of any series with the same issue date, interest rate or formula, Stated Maturity and other terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee within five Business Days after it receives the notice provided for in Section 11.2 from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions of the principal amount of Registered Securities of such series; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Registered Security of such series not redeemed to less than the minimum denomination for a Security of such series established herein or pursuant hereto. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. 79
Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of any series, if any Security selected for partial redemption is converted into Common Stock or exchanged for other securities in part before termination of the conversion or exchange right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted or exchanged during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Section 11.4. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.6, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed, to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed. Failure to give notice by mailing in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Registered Securities designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities or portion thereof. Any notice that is mailed to the Holder of any Registered Securities in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not such Holder receives the notice. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amount) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed, (4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder of such Security will receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed, (5) that, on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price shall become due and payable upon each such Security or portion thereof to be redeemed, and, if applicable, that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date, (6) the place or places where such Securities, together (in the case of Bearer Securities) with all Coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and any accrued interest and Additional Amounts pertaining thereto, (7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, 80
(8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption or the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent is furnished, (9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and no Registered Securities of such series are to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on the Redemption Date pursuant to Section 3.5 or otherwise, the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be made, (10) in the case of Securities of any series that are convertible into Common Stock of the Company or exchangeable for other securities, the conversion or exchange price or rate, the date or dates on which the right to convert or exchange the principal of the Securities of such series to be redeemed will commence or terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, and (11) the CUSIP number or the Euroclear or the Clearstream reference numbers of such Securities, if any (or any other numbers used by a Depository to identify such Securities). A notice of redemption published as contemplated by Section 1.6 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. Section 11.5. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit, with respect to the Securities of any series called for redemption pursuant to Section 11.4, with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money in the applicable Currency sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 or in the Securities of such series) any accrued interest on and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, all such Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date. Section 11.6. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing 81
after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with any accrued interest and Additional Amounts to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Bearer Securities of such series, installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of Coupons for such interest (at an Office or Agency located outside the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2), and provided, further, that, except as otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Registered Securities of such series, installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the Regular Record Dates therefor according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7. If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that any interest or Additional Amounts represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such Security located outside of the United States except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium, until paid, shall bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. Section 11.7. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at any Office or Agency for such Security (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, containing identical terms and provisions, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a Security in global form is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the U.S. Depository or other Depository for such Security in global form as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, without service charge, a new Security in global form in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security in global form so surrendered. 82
Section 11.8. Redemption for Tax Reasons. If (a) the Company shall have on any date (the "Succession Date") consolidated with or merged into, or conveyed or transferred or leased its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any Person which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (b) as result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of such jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or any change in the official administration, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Securities of any series, which change or amendment become effective after the Succession Date or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public on or prior to such Succession Date and is notified to the Company, such continuing Person would be required to pay any Successor Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of such Securities in respect of any payments that it may be required to make with respect to such Securities and (c) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company or such continuing Person taking reasonable measures available to it, the Company or such continuing Person may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) of such Securities, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice as provided in this Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued Interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which a continuing Person would be obligated to pay such Successor Additional Amounts were a payment then due in respect of such Securities, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Successor Additional Amounts must remain in effect. ARTICLE 12 SINKING FUNDS Section 12.1. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise permitted or required in or pursuant to this Indenture or any Security of such series issued pursuant to this Indenture. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of such series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series and this Indenture. 83
Section 12.2. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities. The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (1) deliver Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any of such Securities previously called for redemption or any of such Securities in respect of which cash shall have been released to the Company), together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto, and (2) apply as a credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such series of Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such series of Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. If, as a result of the delivery or credit of Securities of any series in lieu of cash payments pursuant to this Section 12.2, the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed in order to satisfy the remaining sinking fund payment shall be less than $100,000, the Trustee need not call Securities of such series for redemption, except upon Company Request, and such cash payment shall be held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent and applied to the next succeeding sinking fund payment, provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall at the request of the Company from time to time pay over and deliver to the Company any cash payment so being held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of Securities of that series purchased by the Company having an unpaid principal amount equal to the cash payment requested to be released to the Company. Section 12.3. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 75 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting of Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.2, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so credited and not theretofore delivered. If such Officers' Certificate shall specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not less than 60 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.6 and 11.7. 84
ARTICLE 13 REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF HOLDERS Section 13.1. Applicability of Article. Securities of any series which are repayable at the option of the Holders thereof before their Stated Maturity shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series. The repayment of any principal amount of Securities pursuant to such option of the Holder to require repayment of Securities before their Stated Maturity, for purposes of Section 3.9, shall not operate as a payment, redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the Company, at its option, shall deliver or surrender the same to the Trustee with a directive that such Securities be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.1, in connection with any repayment of Securities, the Company may arrange for the purchase of any Securities by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other purchasers to purchase such Securities by paying to the Holders of such Securities on or before the close of business on the repayment date an amount not less than the repayment price payable by the Company on repayment of such Securities, and the obligation of the Company to pay the repayment price of such Securities shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent such payment is so paid by such purchasers. ARTICLE 14 SECURITIES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES Section 14.1. Applicability of Article. Whenever this Indenture provides for (i) any action by, or the determination of any of the rights of, Holders of Securities of any series in which not all of such Securities are denominated in the same Currency, or (ii) any distribution to Holders of Securities, in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the form of Security of any particular series or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities, any amount in respect of any Security denominated in a Currency other than Dollars shall be treated for any such action or distribution as that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount on such reasonable basis of exchange and as of the record date with respect to Registered Securities of such series (if any) for such action, determination of rights or distribution (or, if there shall be no applicable record date, such other date reasonably proximate to the date of such action, determination of rights or distribution) as the Company may specify in a written notice to the Trustee. ARTICLE 15 MEETINGS OF HOLDERS OF SECURITIES Section 15.1. Purposes for Which Meetings May Be Called. A meeting of Holders of Securities of any series may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to this Article to make, give or take any request, demand, authorization, 85
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series. Section 15.2. Call, Notice and Place of Meetings. (1) The Trustee may at any time call a meeting of Holders of Securities of any series for any purpose specified in Section 15.1, to be held at such time and at such place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, if Securities of such series have been issued in whole or in part as Bearer Securities, in London or in such place outside the United States as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of every meeting of Holders of Securities of any series, setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be given, in the manner provided in Section 1.6, not less than 21 nor more than 180 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting. (2) In case at any time the Company (by or pursuant to a Board Resolution) or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of the Holders of Securities of such series for any purpose specified in Section 15.1, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have mailed notice of or made the first publication of the notice of such meeting within 21 days after receipt of such request (whichever shall be required pursuant to Section 1.6) or shall not thereafter proceed to cause the meeting to be held as provided herein, then the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series in the amount above specified, as the case may be, may determine the time and the place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, if Securities of such series are to be issued as Bearer Securities, in London for such meeting and may call such meeting for such purposes by giving notice thereof as provided in clause (1) of this Section. Section 15.3. Persons Entitled to Vote at Meetings. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series, a Person shall be (1) a Holder of one or more Outstanding Securities of such series, or (2) a Person appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy for a Holder or Holders of one or more Outstanding Securities of such series by such Holder or Holders. The only Persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be the Persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel, any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel and any representatives of the Company and its counsel. Section 15.4. Quorum; Action. The Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a series shall constitute a quorum for any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series. In the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes after the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of Holders of Securities of such series, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may be adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any reconvened meeting, such reconvened meeting may be further adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the 86
adjournment of such reconvened meeting. Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section 15.2(1), except that such notice need be given only once not less than five days prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage, as provided above, of the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series which shall constitute a quorum. Except as limited by the proviso to Section 9.2, any resolution presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted only by the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; provided, however, that, except as limited by the proviso to Section 9.2, any resolution with respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act which this Indenture expressly provides may be made, given or taken by the Holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a series may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders of such specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series. Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all the Holders of Securities of such series and the Coupons appertaining thereto, whether or not such Holders were present or represented at the meeting. Section 15.5. Determination of Voting Rights; Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.4 and the appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 1.4 or by having the signature of the person executing the proxy witnessed or Guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 1.4 to certify to the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 1.4 or other proof. (2) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 15.2(2), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting. 87
(3) At any meeting, each Holder of a Security of such series or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security of such series or proxy. (4) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly called pursuant to Section 15.2 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting; and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice. Section 15.6. Counting Votes and Recording Action of Meetings. The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be by written ballots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities of such series or of their representatives by proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of the Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by them. The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in triplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, at least in triplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 15.2 and, if applicable, Section 15.4. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall be delivered to the Company, and another to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated. 88

The Company or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent. The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Paying Agent in connection with the Notes. Section 202 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities.

In either case, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order (which the Company agrees to deliver promptly), authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities in exchange therefor. Certificated Securities issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities shall be registered in such names and shall be in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered such Certificated Securities to the persons in whose names such Certificated Securities are so registered. Such exchange shall be effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. Nothing herein shall require the Trustee to communicate directly with beneficial owners, and the Trustee shall in connection with any transfers hereunder be entitled to rely on instructions received through the registered Holder. 4
In the event that Certificated Securities are issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and, thereafter, the events or conditions specified in this Section 202(a)(1) which required such exchange shall have ceased to exist, the Company shall mail notice to the Trustee and to the Holders stating that Holders may exchange Certificated Securities for interests in Global Securities by complying with the procedures set forth in this Indenture and briefly describing such procedures and the events or circumstances requiring that such notice be given. (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this First Supplemental Indenture other than the provisions set forth in Section 202(a)(1) hereof, a Global Security may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository. Nothing in this Section 202(a)(2) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 202. (b) Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities. When Certificated Securities are presented by a Holder to a Security Registrar with a request: (1) to register the transfer of the Certificated Securities to a person who will take delivery thereof in the form of Certificated Securities only; or (2) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount of Certificated Securities of other authorized denominations, such Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities presented or surrendered for register of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in accordance with the tenth paragraph of Section 3.5 of the Indenture. (c) Transfers to the Company. Nothing in this First Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall prohibit the sale or other transfer of any Notes (including beneficial interests in Global Securities) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which Notes shall thereupon be canceled in accordance with Section 3.9 of the Indenture. Section 203 Amount. (a) The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Notes for original issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300,000,000 upon one or more Company Orders for the authentication and delivery of Notes, without any further action by the Company.

Notes ("Additional Notes") in the future on the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the right to receive accrued and unpaid interest), except for differences in the issue price and Issue Date of the Additional Notes, and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes then Outstanding. No Additional Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes. Any Additional Notes would rank equally and ratably with the Notes then Outstanding and shall be treated as a single series for all purposes hereunder and under the Indenture. From and after the Issue Date of any Additional Notes, any reference herein to "Notes" shall include such Additional Notes. (b) The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 204 Interest. The principal of the Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum from July 21, 2003 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing January 15, 2004, to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (each, a "Regular Record Date").

The Company provided guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2004 indicating that it currently foresees revenue increasing sequentially six to ten percent, or in a range of $1.375 to $1.425 billion. Jabil said it currently foresees core operating income increasing sequentially seven to twelve percent and core earnings of $0.22 to $0.24 per diluted share, depending upon exact levels of production.

Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Due to its recent acquisitions and restructuring programs, the Company has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of the Company's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

FISCAL YEAR SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK "We are pleased to conclude our fiscal year with a quarter that proved to be at the high end of our expectations, making this both a record quarter and fiscal year. We grew revenues 32 percent, increased core earnings 46 percent and improved core earnings per share 44 percent over fiscal 2004. Looking ahead, we plan to grow our business with the steady trend to outsourcing and believe 2005 will be another strong year for Jabil," said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive Officer. Jabil provided guidance for its full fiscal year 2005 indicating that it currently foresees revenue in a range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, core earnings growth of 18 to 22 percent and core earnings per share in a range of $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are currently estimated to be $1.05 to $1.09 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to include $0.15 per share for amortization of intangibles and acquisition related charges.) Jabil management also reiterated guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2005, indicating they currently expect revenue to range from $1.75 to $1.85 billion and core earnings per share to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are currently estimated to be $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
Q4 2004 Earnings Release--Add Three September 21, 2004 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Due to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, Jabil has incurred significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, a non-GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(1) There were no acquisition-related charges recorded during the three months ended November 30, 2004.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently published Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R, which is effective from the first interim period that begins after June 15, 2005, will require that compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions, including stock options, be recognized in the financial statements. Accordingly, Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("the Company") will implement the revised standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Currently, the Company accounts for its share-based payment transactions under the provisions of APB 25, which does not necessarily require the recognition of compensation cost in the statement of earnings of the financial statements.
Share-Based Payment
On January 28, 2005, in response to the recently published accounting standard referenced above, the Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved accelerating the vesting of most out-of-the-money, unvested stock options held by current employees, including executive officers and directors. An option was considered out-of-the-money if the stated option exercise price was greater than the closing price, $23.31, of the Company's common stock on the day before the Compensation Committee approved the acceleration. The Compensation Committee did not approve accelerating the vesting of out-of-the-money unvested performance accelerated vesting options held by certain officers of Jabil as it believed that, notwithstanding the potential additional compensation expense that could be avoided by accelerating such options, the existing stated financial performance criteria should be met before any of such options are accelerated. The accelerated vesting was effective as of January 28, 2005; however, holders of incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) to purchase 186,964 shares of common stock and holders of certain tax-qualified stock options issued to certain foreign employees, have the opportunity to decline the accelerated vesting in order to prevent changing the status of the incentive stock option for federal income tax purposes to a non-qualified stock option or the restriction of the availability of favorable tax treatment under applicable foreign law. Jabil's full Board ratified the acceleration of option vesting to the extent it affected options held by members of the Compensation Committee. The following table summarizes the options subject to acceleration:
 
The decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to avoid recognizing compensation cost in the statement of earnings in future financial statements upon the effectiveness of SFAS 123R. Assuming that no holders of incentive stock options or the referenced foreign tax-favored options elect to decline the accelerated vesting, it is estimated that the maximum future compensation expense that will be avoided, based on Jabil's implementation date for FAS 123R of September 1, 2005, is approximately $85.0 million, of which approximately $19.3 million is related to options held by executive officers and directors of the Company. The Company will report the avoided future compensation expense in the fiscal year 2005 financial statements as pro forma footnote disclosures, as permitted under the transition guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 15 percent to $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the same period of fiscal 2004.
St. Petersburg, FL  March 17, 2005
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 15 percent to $57.8 million compared to $50.2 million for the same period of fiscal 2004. On a GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $46.0 million as compared to $40.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.22 compared to $0.19 for the same period of fiscal 2004.
Jabil's second quarter of fiscal 2005 core operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 10 percent to $68.1 million or 4.0 percent of net revenue compared to $62.2 million or 4.2 percent of net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Core earnings increased 10 percent to $54.9 million, compared to $49.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Core earnings per share increased 13 percent to $0.27 per diluted share for the period, compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
(Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information below).
 
Q2 2005 Earnings ReleaseAdd One March 17, 2005
Quarterly Highlights
"We are pleased to post record results for the first half of our fiscal year and expect our growth to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2005. We now expect fiscal 2005 growth in revenue and earnings per share of approximately 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively. And, we are well positioned to carry this momentum into fiscal 2006," said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are grateful for the dedication of our people and welcome our new associates from Varian, Inc."
Business Outlook
On March 11 Jabil concluded its previously announced intention to acquire the electronics manufacturing business of Varian, Inc.
th
Jabil provided updated guidance for the full fiscal year and its third quarter of fiscal 2005. For the third quarter, Jabil indicated that they currently foresee net revenue in a range of $1.90 to $1.95 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $0.32 to $0.34 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter are currently estimated to be in a range of $0.27 to $0.29 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 are currently estimated to include $0.05 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
Jabil management also increased its previous full fiscal 2005 guidance, indicating expectations of net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $1.27 to $1.29 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.18 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Supplemental Information
Jabil has incurred charges from its acquisitions that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the nature of these amounts do not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(1) There were no acquisition-related charges recorded during the six months ended February 28, 2005. During the six months ended February 29, 2004, we recorded acquisition-related charges of $1.3 million ($1.0 million after-tax) primarily in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Royal Philips Electronics and NEC Corporation.
 
(1) The computation of earnings per diluted share and core earnings per diluted share for the three and six months ended February 29, 2004 includes the elimination of $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in interest expense, net of tax. This interest expense is related to the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes, which would have been extinguished had the conversion occurred, as the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive. The notes were redeemed for cash in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.
(2) Diluted common shares for the three and six months ended February 29, 2004 include 8,406,960 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes as the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive. The notes were redeemed for cash in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On May 11, 2005, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a five-year, $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement ("New Revolver"). The New Revolver was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citicorp USA, Inc. as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent; and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, SunTrust Bank, and ABN Amro Bank N.V. as co-documentation agents. Some of the lenders under the New Revolver and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. In addition, the Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. The New Revolver, which expires on May 11, 2010, may be increased to a maximum of $750.0 million at the request of the Company if approved by the lenders. Such requests must be for an increase of at least $50.0 million or an integral multiple thereof, and may only be made once per calendar year. Interest and fees on New Revolver advances are based on the Company's unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at either the base rate or a rate equal to 0.50% to 0.950% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate, available for U.S. dollar advances only, represents the greater of the agent's prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the New Revolver. Fees include a facility fee based on the total commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit, and a utilization fee to be added to the interest rate and the letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds 50% of the total commitments of the lenders. Based on the Company's current unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest plus the applicable facility and utilization fee on a full Eurocurrency rate draw would be 1.00% above the Eurocurrency rate as defined above. The New Revolver is unsecured and includes various covenants, limitations and events of default currently customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. No initial draw under the New Revolver has been made.
          The New Revolver replaces the Company's existing $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of July 14, 2003, as amended, which was to expire on July 14, 2006 ("Existing Revolver"). The Existing Revolver was entered into among the Company and certain of its borrowing subsidiaries; certain lenders; SunTrust Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC as co-syndication agents; ABN Amro Bank N.V. and Royal Bank of Canada as co-documentation agents; and Bank One, NA as administrative agent. Some of the lenders under the Existing Revolver and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, the Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. On May 10, 2005, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolver using cash on hand from operations.
          The foregoing description of the New Revolver is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the New Revolver, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a "Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such Revolving Credit Advance. Each Lender shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Advances denominated in Dollars, and before 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower requesting the Revolving Credit Borrowing at the account specified in the wiring instructions in the applicable Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing or, if no account is so specified, at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02; provided, however, that, if such borrowing is denominated in Dollars, the Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Line Advances made by the Swing Line Banks and by any other Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, available to the Swing Line Banks and such other Lenders for repayment of such Swing Line Advances. (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing by the Borrower to each Swing Line Bank and the Agent, of which the Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders. Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "Notice of Swing Line Borrowing") shall be by telephone, confirmed at once in writing, or telecopier or telex, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity shall be no later than the tenth Business Day after the requested date of such Borrowing). Each Swing Line Bank shall, before 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing, unless any Lender gives prior notice to such Swing Line Bank or the Agent that the applicable conditions of Article III would not be satisfied at the time of such Swing Line Borrowing, make such Swing Line Bank's ratable portion of such Swing Line Borrowing available (based on the respective Swing Line Commitments of the Swing Line Banks) to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower requesting the Swing Line Borrowing at the account specified in the wiring instructions in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing or, if no account is so specified, at the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.02. Upon written demand by any Swing Line Bank with a Swing Line Advance, with a copy of such demand to the Agent, such Swing Line Bank shall sell and assign to each such other Lender and each other Lender will purchase from such Swing Line Bank, such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Swing Line Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Swing Line Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Swing Line Bank which made such Advance, provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon any such assignment by Swing Line Bank to any other Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it and there are no adverse claims thereto, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, this Agreement, the Notes or the Borrower. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such Lender is required to have made such amount available to the Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for 14
purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by such Swing Line Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business day. (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrowers may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing is less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than six separate Revolving Credit Borrowings. (d) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower requesting the Borrowing. In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender or a Swing Line Bank prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be, that such Lender or Swing Line Bank will not make available to the Agent such Lender's or Swing Line Bank's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be, the Agent may assume that such Lender or Swing Line Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.02, as applicable, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower requesting the Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender or Swing Line Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender or Swing Line Bank and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender or Swing Line Bank, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies. If such Lender or Swing Line Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's or Swing Line Bank's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. (f) The failure of any Lender or Swing Line Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender or Swing Line Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be, but no Lender or Swing Line Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender or Swing Line Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance to be made by such other Lender or Swing Line Bank on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be. SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the tenth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Issuance of such Letter of Credit (or on such shorter notice as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree), by any Borrower to any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall give the Agent, prompt notice thereof. Each such notice by a Borrower of Issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Issuance") shall be by telecopier or telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such Issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which shall not be later than the earlier of (1) one year after the issuance thereof (or one year after its renewal or extension) and (2) ten Business Days before the 15
Termination Date), (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit shall be issued pursuant to such application and agreement for letter of credit as such Issuing Bank and the applicable Borrower shall agree for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a "Letter of Credit Agreement"). If the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its reasonable discretion (it being understood that any such form shall have only explicit documentary conditions to draw and shall not include discretionary conditions), such Issuing Bank will, if in its reasonable discretion it elects to do so, and unless any Lender gives prior notice to such Issuing Bank or the Agent that the applicable conditions of Article III would not be satisfied at the time of such issuance, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.03, make such Letter of Credit available to the applicable Borrower at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as otherwise agreed with such Borrower in connection with such Issuance. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. (b) Participations. By the Issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing or decreasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, in same day funds, such Lender's Ratable Share of each drawing made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason, which amount will be advanced, and deemed to be a Revolving Credit Advance to such Borrower hereunder, regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender's Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment is amended pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 9.07 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement. (c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by an Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit which is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of a Revolving Credit Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft, without regard to whether the making of such an Advance would exceed such Issuing Bank's Unused Commitment. Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the applicable Borrower and the Agent. Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the applicable Borrower, each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of such outstanding Revolving Credit Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(b). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of an outstanding Revolving Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Revolving Credit Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Revolving Credit Advance made by such Lender on 16
such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. (d) Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the Agent (with a copy to the Company) on the first Business Day of each month a written report summarizing Issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and (B) to the Agent (with a copy to the Company) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. (e) Failure to Make Advances. The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it on the date specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date. SECTION 2.04. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing June 30, 2005, and on the later of the Termination Date and the date all Advances are paid in full. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) Each Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a commission on such Lender's Ratable Share of the average daily aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower and outstanding from time to time at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (x) the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Rate Advances in effect from time to time during such calendar quarter plus (y) the Applicable Utilization Fee in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2005, and on the Termination Date; provided that the Applicable Margin shall be 2% above the Applicable Margin in effect upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default if such Borrower is required to pay default interest pursuant to Section 2.07(b). (ii) Each Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee and such other commissions, issuance fees, transfer fees and other fees and charges in connection with the Issuance or administration of each Letter of Credit as such Borrower and such Issuing Bank shall agree. (c) Agent's Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Company and the Agent. SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. The Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part the Revolving Credit Commitments or the Swing Line Commitments, provided that (a) the amount of each such reduction shall not exceed the Unused Commitments or the unused Swing Line Commitments, respectively, (b) each partial reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be applied ratably to the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders, (c) each partial reduction of the Swing Line Commitments shall be applied ratably to the respective Swing Line Commitments of the Swing Line Lenders and (d) each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. SECTION 2.06. Repayment of Advances and Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) Revolving Credit Advances. Each Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances made to it and then outstanding. (b) Letter of Credit Drawings. The obligations of each Borrower under any Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such 17
Borrower shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it being understood that any such payment by such Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not constitute a waiver of, any rights such Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by any Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by such Borrower thereof, including as provided in Section 9.15): (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Note, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing being, collectively, the "L/C Related Documents"); (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of such Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related Documents; (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (v) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of such Borrower in respect of the L/C Related Documents; or (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower or a guarantor. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (c) Swing Line Advances. Each Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Swing Line Banks and each other Lender which has made a Swing Line Advance the outstanding principal amount of each Swing Line Advance made to it by each of them on the earlier of the maturity date specified in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing (which maturity shall be no later than ten Business Days after the requested date of such Borrowing) and the Termination Date. SECTION 2.07. Interest on Advances. (a) Scheduled Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to it and owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: 18
(i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance and for each Swing Line Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time plus (z) the Applicable Utilization Fee in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full or Swing Line Advance is paid in full. (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time plus (z) the Applicable Utilization Fee in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full. (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, require the Borrowers to pay interest ("Default Interest") on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above; provided, however, that following acceleration of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Agent. SECTION 2.08. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference Bank agrees, if requested by the Agent, to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurocurrency Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.07(a)(ii). (b) If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that (i) they are unable to obtain matching deposits in the London inter-bank market at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in sufficient amounts to fund their respective Revolving Credit Advances as a part of such Borrowing during its Interest Period or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon (A) the Borrower of such Eurocurrency Rate Advances will, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (1) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (2) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) exchange such Advances into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. (c) If any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances 19
are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate Advances. (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall automatically (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate Advances. (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended. (f) If Moneyline Telerate Markets Page 3750 is unavailable and fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Agent for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances after the Agent has requested such information, (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, (ii) each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. SECTION 2.09. Optional Conversion of Revolving Credit Advances. The Borrower of any Advance may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, Convert all or any portion of the Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Dollars of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(c) and no Conversion of any Revolving Credit Advances shall result in more separate Revolving Credit Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(c). Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Dollar denominated Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower giving such notice. SECTION 2.10. Prepayments of Advances. (a) Optional. Each Borrower may, upon notice at least two Business Days' prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, and not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to 20
the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment of Revolving Credit Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum or a Revolving Credit Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof, (y) each partial prepayment of Swing Line Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 and (z) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). (b) Mandatory. (i) If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company that, on any interest payment date, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding exceeds 103% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders on such date. (ii) Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period or at its maturity, any additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company and the Lenders. SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority including, without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.14 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the Issuance or maintenance of or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the Issuance or maintenance of or participation in any 21
Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency hereunder, (a) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, upon such demand (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. SECTION 2.13. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency), irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds. Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 A.M. (at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency) on the day when due in such Committed Currency to the Agent, by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.18 and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days (or, in each case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies where market practice differs, in accordance with market practice), in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the 22
Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies. (e) To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Currency or from Dollars to a Committed Currency or from a Committed Currency to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(e) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and provided further that the Borrowers agree to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(e), absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent or such Lender, respectively. SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower to or for the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.14) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto other than such liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) attributable to the acts of or failure to act by such Lender. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. Upon request from a Borrower, the Lender or Agent (as the case may be) shall provide such Borrower with such information and documentation as to the calculation of the indemnification payment as such Borrower may reasonably request. 23
(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on behalf of such Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of such Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "United States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code. (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (a "non-U.S. Lender"), on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Company (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Company with two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Company and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. (f) For any period with respect to which a non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the Company with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in Section 2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided), such non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to payment or indemnification under Section 2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes. (g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (h) If an additional payment is made under subsection (a) or (c) above for the account of any Lender and such Lender, in its sole discretion (exercising good faith), determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been granted a credit against or release or remission for, or repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such Lender shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the applicable Borrower such amount as the Lender shall, in its sole discretion (exercising good faith), have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and which will leave 24
such Lender (after such payment) in no worse position than it would have been in if such Borrower had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Such Lender shall provide to the applicable Borrower reasonable information regarding any creditable amounts it expects to receive, and the expected time for receiving such credit or refund. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than (x) as payment of an Advance made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.03(c), (y) as a payment of a Swing Line Advance made by a Swing Line Bank that has not been participated to the other Lenders pursuant to Section 2.02(b) or (z) pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) in excess of its Ratable Share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.16. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to such Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender. (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assumption Agreement and] each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from such Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof. (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement. SECTION 2.17. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries. 25
SECTION 2.18. Increase in the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) The Company may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the Termination Date, by notice to the Agent, request that the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments be increased by an amount of $50,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a "Commitment Increase") to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled Termination Date (the "Increase Date") as specified in the related notice to the Agent; provided, however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments at any time exceed $750,000,000 and (ii) on the date of any request by the Company for a Commitment Increase and on the related Increase Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article III shall be satisfied. (b) The Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of a request by the Company for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed Increase Date and (iii) the date by which Lenders wishing to participate in the Commitment Increase must commit to an increase in the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments (the "Commitment Date"). Each Lender that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each an "Increasing Lender") shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment. If the Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as are agreed between the Company and the Agent. (c) Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Agent shall notify the Company as to the amount, if any, by which the Lenders are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase. If the aggregate amount by which the Lenders are willing to participate in any requested Commitment Increase on any such Commitment Date is less than the requested Commitment Increase, then the Company may extend offers to one or more Eligible Assignees to participate in any portion of the requested Commitment Increase that has not been committed to by the Lenders as of the applicable Commitment Date; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or more. (d) On each Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.18(b) (each such Eligible Assignee, an "Assuming Lender") shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.18(b)) as of such Increase Date; provided, however, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date: (i) (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Executive Committee of such Board approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Company (which may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto; (ii) an assumption agreement from each Assuming Lender, if any, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent (each an "Assumption Agreement"), duly executed by such Eligible Assignee, the Agent and the Company; and (iii) confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Company and the Agent. On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.18(d), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Company, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Increase Date, make available for the account of its 26
Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) over (ii) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). After the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Advances owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). ARTICLE III CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS AND LENDING SECTION 3.01. Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of Section 2.01.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by such Borrower to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Borrower. 38
SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. (a) The Company guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The obligations of the Company under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any other Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Company to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Borrower or whether any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Company under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Note or any agreement or instrument relating thereto; (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement or any Note, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise; (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (d) any manner of application of any collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes or any other assets of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (f) any failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Company any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower now or hereafter known to the Agent or such Lender (the Company waiving any duty on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose such information); (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of the Company or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or (h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any other guarantor or surety. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect 39
or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Borrower or any other Person or any collateral. (b) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future. (c) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Company or other rights of the Company to proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person or any collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Company hereunder. (d) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Company any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender.

If (i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, (iii) the Termination Date shall have occurred and (iv) all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Agent and the Lenders will, at the Company's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Company appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Company of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Company pursuant to this Guaranty.

Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Agent or any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agent or such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in Section 9.07. ARTICLE VIII THE AGENT SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and Issuing Bank, as applicable) hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other number of Lenders as required hereunder), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Company or any other Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 8.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 8.03. Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citibank shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its individual capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Company or any such Subsidiary, all as if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was obtained or received in any capacity other than as Agent. 41
SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company) from and against such Lender's Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as such) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement (collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"), provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent (in its capacity as such) in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party. (b) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Issuing Banks (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Company) from and against such Lender's Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Issuing Bank (in its capacity as such) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank (in its capacity as such) hereunder or in connection herewith; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse any such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Company under Section 9.04, to the extent that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Company. (c) The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any amount required to be paid by the Lenders to the Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for its Ratable Share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for such other Lender's Ratable Share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. Each of the Agent and each Issuing Bank agrees to return to the Lenders their respective Ratable Shares of any amounts paid under this Section 8.05 that are subsequently reimbursed by the Company. SECTION 8.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of the Company. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become 42
vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. SECTION 8.07. Sub-Agent. The Sub-Agent has been designated under this Agreement to carry out duties of the Agent. The Sub-Agent shall be subject to each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent, and each of the Company, each other Borrower and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be entitled to exercise each of the rights and shall be entitled to each of the benefits of the Agent under this Agreement as relate to the performance of its obligations hereunder. SECTION 8.08. Other Agents. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that neither the documentation agent nor any other Lender designated as any "Agent" on the signature pages hereof has any liability hereunder other than in its capacity as a Lender. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, nor consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01, (b) increase the Commitments of the Lenders other than in accordance with Section 2.18, (c) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (e) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances, or the number of Lenders, that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (f) release the Company from any of its obligations under Article VII, (g) extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit to a date later than the Termination Date or (h) amend this Section 9.01; and provided further that (x) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note (y) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Swing Line Bank, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or obligations of the Swing Line Banks under this Agreement; and (z) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Issuing Banks in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, adversely affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Banks in their capacities as such under this Agreement.

The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, (A) all computer, duplication, appraisal, consultant, and audit expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other than Section 2.01, which shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the Company nor any other Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders. SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations.

under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, its Swing Line Commitment, the Advances owing to it, its participations in Letters of Credit and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of (x) the Revolving Credit Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) the Swing Line Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, in each case, unless the Company and the Agent otherwise agree, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) shall be arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Borrowers or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, and (vi) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 payable by the parties to each such assignment, provided, however, that in the case of each assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company, such recordation fee shall be payable by the Company except that no such recordation fee shall be payable in the case of an assignment made at the request of the Company to an Eligible Assignee that is an existing Lender. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto with respect to the interest assigned and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, in addition to any rights and obligations theretofore held by it as a Lender, and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such assignment) and be released from its obligations (other than its obligations under Section 8.05 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such assignment) under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Company or any other Borrower or the performance or observance by the Company or any other Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that, to the extent it has so requested, it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and 46

(c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Company. (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Company and the other Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Company or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrowers hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Company , the other Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Company or any other Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Company furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Company; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Company Information relating to the Company received by it from such Lender in accordance with Section 9.08 hereof. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time, without notice to or consent of any Person, assign, pledge or create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Neither the Agent nor any Lender may disclose to any Person any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the Company furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by the Company (such information being referred to collectively herein as the "Company Information"), except that each of the Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Company Information (i) to its and its affiliates' employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Company Information and instructed to keep such Company Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory 47
authority, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.08, to any assignee or participant or prospective assignee or participant or to any direct, indirect, actual or prospective counterparty (and its advisor) to any swap, derivative or securitization transaction entered into in connection with this Credit Agreement, (vii) to the extent such Company Information (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.08 by the Agent or such Lender, or (B) is or becomes available to the Agent or such Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company and (viii) with the consent of the Company. SECTION 9.09. Designated Subsidiaries. (a) Designation. The Company may at any time, and from time to time, by delivery to the Agent of a Designation Agreement duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, designate such Subsidiary as a "Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement and such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a "Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary. (b) Termination. Upon the indefeasible payment and performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Issuance in respect of such Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiary's status as a "Designated Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Agent to the Lenders (which notice the Agent shall give promptly, and only upon its receipt of a request therefor from the Company). Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary. SECTION 9.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. SECTION 9.11. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 9.12. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at Citibank's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. (b) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency into Dollars, the parties agree to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase such Committed Currency with Dollars at Citibank's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. (c) The obligation of any Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the "Primary Currency") to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, each Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) 48
against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to such Borrower such excess. SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each Designated Subsidiary hereby agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State court or in such federal court may be made upon the Company and each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably appoints the Company its authorized agent to accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Company to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. The Company and each Designated Subsidiary hereby further irrevocably consent to the service of process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at its address specified pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction. To the extent that each Designated Subsidiary has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement. (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. SECTION 9.14. Substitution of Currency. If a change in any Committed Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definition of Eurocurrency Rate) will be deemed amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Company) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency had occurred. SECTION 9.15. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrowers assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither an Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; or (c) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the applicable Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by such Borrower that such Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to excuse such Issuing Bank if it acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct in accepting such documents. 49
SECTION 9.16. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. Each Borrower shall provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lenders in order to assist the Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act. SECTION 9.17. Power of Attorney. Each Subsidiary of the Company may from time to time authorizes and appoints the Company as its attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver (a) any amendment, waiver or consent in accordance with Section 9.01 on behalf of and in the name of such Subsidiary and (b) any notice or other communication hereunder, on behalf of and in the name of such Subsidiary. Such authorization shall become effective as of the date on which such Subsidiary becomes a party hereto and, if requested by the Required Lenders, delivers to the Agent a power of attorney enforceable under applicable law and any additional information to the Agent as necessary to make such power of attorney the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Subsidiary. 50
SECTION 9.18. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Company, the other Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes or the actions of the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

Net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 19 percent to $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the same period of fiscal 2004.
St. Petersburg, FL  June 21, 2005
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 31 percent to $73.2 million compared to $55.9 million for the same period of fiscal 2004. On a GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 48 percent to $59.4 million as compared to $40.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 53 percent to $0.29 compared to $0.19 for the same period of fiscal 2004.

Core earnings per share increased 27 percent to $0.33 per diluted share for the period, compared to $0.26 for the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
(Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information below).

Quarterly Highlights
Business Outlook
"Our dedicated global workforce delivered another strong quarter of performance. Our superior operational and financial results flow from an unwavering focus on customer satisfaction and operational execution. We expect our growth momentum to continue in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 and as we move into fiscal 2006," said President and Chief Executive Officer Timothy L. Main.
Jabil management also updated its guidance and outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Jabil indicated that they currently foresee net revenue in a range of $2.0 to $2.1 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $0.35 to $0.37 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter are currently estimated to be in a range of $0.31 to $0.33 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
The company reiterated its full fiscal year 2005 guidance. Jabil expects to produce net revenue of approximately $7.5 billion and core earnings per share in a range of $1.27 to $1.29 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to be in a range of $1.08 to $1.10 per diluted share.
(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the year are currently estimated to include $0.19 per share for amortization of intangibles.)
The company also provided guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2006. Jabil said it expects sequential revenue growth for its first fiscal quarter of 8 to 17 percent, indicating a revenue range of $2.2 to $2.4 billion and core earnings of $0.40 to $0.44 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 are currently estimated to be in a range of $0.37 to $0.41 per diluted share.

Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Jabil has incurred charges from its acquisitions that are included in the GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the nature of these amounts do not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

     2.1      PLACE OF MEETINGS
     Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation.
     2.2      ANNUAL MEETING
     The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at 9:00 a.m. on the first Thursday of the fourth calendar month after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. However, if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.
     2.3      SPECIAL MEETING
     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president, or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than a majority of the votes at that meeting.
     If a special meeting is requested by any person or persons other than the board of directors or the president or the chairman of the board, then the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The board of directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than 35 nor more than 120
 
days after the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and the place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 of these bylaws. If the notice is not given within 61 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board of directors may be held.

     All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.

The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.
     2.5      MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE

Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. If no such address appears on the corporation's books or is given, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent to that stockholder by mail or telegraphic or other written communication to the corporation's principal executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is located. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or either means of written communication.
     If any notice addressed to a stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the stockholder at that address, then all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available to the stockholder on written demand of the stockholder at the principal executive office of the corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice.
     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
     2.6      QUORUM
     The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
     2.7      ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
     Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.6 of these bylaws.
     When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of these bylaws. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
     2.8      VOTING
     The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the proposal; but, if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled to vote.
     If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.
     2.9      VALIDATION OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE; CONSENT
     The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
     Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not
 
a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     2.10      STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders maybe taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted.
     Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by written consent may be taken following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of the corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
     2.11      RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
     For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat or entitled to give consent to corporate action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any such action without a meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote or to give consents, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
          the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and
          the record date for determining stockholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
     The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
     2.12      PROXIES
     Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, or by the transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, any other means of electronic transmission, or any other acceptable means
 
under the Delaware General Corporate Laws, to the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such writing or transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that any such reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. However, no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 (c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     2.13      INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3) If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
     Such inspectors shall:
     (a)      determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
     (b)      receive votes, ballots or consents;
     (c)      hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
     (d)      count and tabulate all votes or consents;
     (e)      determine when the polls shall close;
     (f)      determine the result; and
     (g)      do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
 
     3.1      POWERS
     Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
     3.2      NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     3.4      RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES

If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
     Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
          Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
          Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly
 
created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
     If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application or any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 217 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer, the treasurer, the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.

     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stocks provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be met forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
 
powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
     8.6      LOST CERTIFICATES
     Except as provided in this section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
     8.7      CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term person includes both a corporation and a natural person.
     The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, .nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
     If it should be deemed advisable in the judgment of the board of directors of the corporation that the corporation should be dissolved, the board, after the adoption of a resolution to that effect by a majority of the whole board at any meeting called for that purpose, shall cause notice to be mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereon of the adoption of the resolution and of a meeting of stockholders to take action upon the resolution.
     At the meeting a vote shall be taken for and against the proposed dissolution. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon votes for the proposed dissolution, then a certificate stating that the dissolution has been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers shall be executed, acknowledged, and filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such certificates becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved.
 
     Whenever all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution consent in writing, either in person or by .duly authorized attorney, to a dissolution, no meeting of directors or stockholders shall be necessary. The consent shall be filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such consents becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved if the consent is signed by an attorney, then the original power of attorney or a photocopy thereof shall be attached to and filed with the consent. The consent filed with the Secretary of State shall have attached to it the affidavit of the secretary or some other officer of the corporation stating that the consent has been signed by or on behalf of all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution; in addition, there shall be attached to the consent a certification by the secretary or some other officer of the corporation setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers of the corporation.
     11.1       APPOINTMENT OF A CUSTODIAN IN CERTAIN CASES
     The Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians and, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for the corporation when:
          at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or-would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or
          the business of the corporation is suffering or is threatened with irreparable injury because the directors are so divided respecting the management of the affairs of the corporation that the required vote for action by the board of directors cannot be obtained and the stockholders are unable to terminate this division or
          the corporation has abandoned its business and has failed within a reasonable time to take steps to dissolve, liquidate or distribute its assets.
     11.2      DUTIES OF CUSTODIAN
     The custodian shall have all the powers and title of a receiver appointed under Section 291 of the General-Corporation Law of Delaware, but the authority of the custodian shall be to continue the business of the corporation and not to liquidate its affairs and distribute its assets, except when the Court of Chancery otherwise orders and except in cases arising under Sections 226(a)(3) or 352(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     The Jabil Circuit, Inc. 2005 Proxy Statement, which was mailed to stockholders on or about December 16, 2005, solicits stockholder votes on several important matters, including proposed amendments to our 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Subsequent to the distribution of our 2005 Proxy Statement, we received feedback in connection with that proposal regarding concerns over existing Plan language that permits, without prior stockholder approval, a buy-out of an outstanding award for cash or shares. That Plan feature has never been used before. In light of the importance of the Plan to our ability to attract and retain employees, the Board of Directors amended the Plan today to alleviate the above concerns by expressly prohibiting such a buy-out without the prior approval or consent of the Company's stockholders. Such amendment did not require stockholder approval and is not being voted on at the upcoming meeting.
     The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Exhibit 99
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the anticipated unaudited financial results for our fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2006, our outlook for our business and our long-term outlook for our company, our industry and our business sectors. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the finalization of our results for our fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2006 resulting in variances from our announced anticipated financial results; fluctuations in operating results; the results of the review of our past stock option grants being conducted by a Special Committee of our Board and Governmental Authorities; the accuracy of the stated dates of our historical option grants and whether all proper corporate and other procedures were followed; the impact of any restatement of financial statements of the Company or other actions that may be taken or required as a result of such reviews; risks and costs inherent in litigation, including that related to the Company's stock option grants or any restatement of the financial statements of the Company; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing any rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings.

... Jabil Circuit Inc, said today it expects its fiscal 2006 third quarter revenue to be consistent with the range previously provided of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and said it expects to achieve under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), earnings per share of approximately $0.26 to $0.30 cents per diluted share. Core earnings per share are expected to be $0.33 to $0.37 per diluted share versus its original guidance of $0.43.
St. Petersburg, FL  June 12, 2006
(Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the supplemental information below.)
The shortfall in earnings versus previous guidance was driven primarily by operational issues within the company's electromechanical operations and with certain production and repair facilities in the America's region.
"We are disappointed with our financial performance in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 and are committed to improving our operational and financial performance," said President and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy L. Main. "Despite these short-term challenges, we are optimistic about the future. Revenues continue to show strong growth and we continue to expect core earnings for the quarter and for the year to exceed prior year levels."
Jabil will hold an update conference call tomorrow morning at 8:30 am EST live on the Internet at to further discuss the contents of this press release. The company will announce full financial results for fiscal 2006 third quarter on Wednesday, June 21, 2006 at 4:30 EST. Replays of each call will be available for replay on the web at located in the investor relations' section.

Business Outlook
"Lowering expectations for the balance of fiscal 2006 is a disappointment. We expect a limited number of execution issues to be resolved in the near term. In addition, we intend to rationalize our footprint in certain high cost geographies," said Jabil President & CEO, Timothy L. Main. "Demand overall continues to be very strong across a broad range of sectors. We expect over $3 billion in revenue and a return to core operating margins of 4 percent or better in our first fiscal quarter of 2007."
The company provided guidance for its fourth quarter of 2006. Jabil said it currently expects its fourth quarter revenue to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.95 billion and core earnings of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 are currently estimated to be $0.24 to $0.29 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 are currently estimated to include $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.03 per share for stock-based compensation required to be expensed in fiscal 2006 under new accounting guidelines, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.123R  Share Based Payment ("SFAS 123R")).
The company updated its full fiscal year 2006 guidance, saying it expects revenue growth of 35 to 37 percent or $10.1 to $10.3 billion. The company expects to grow full fiscal year core earnings per share 15 to 19 percent to $1.47 to $1.52 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently expected to be $1.22 to $1.27 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to include $0.11 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.14 per share for stock-based compensation required to be expensed in fiscal 2006 under new accounting guidelines, SFAS 123R.)
Jabil announced that it is planning to realign its manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies to properly size its manufacturing sites with current market conditions. The company said it would begin consultation with employees in the coming weeks, seek its Board of Directors' approval and finalize these plans. Based on preliminary work, management currently estimates that the realignment could result in approximately $200 to $250 million in charges, which would involve plant closings and headcount reductions. It is currently estimated that a significant portion of these charges would be recorded in the company's fourth fiscal quarter. The cash cost of such charges is currently estimated to be in the range of $150 to $200 million over the course of the next two fiscal years.
Supplemental Information
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors appointed a special committee of the Board to review certain matters in response to a derivative lawsuit filed concerning certain stock options grants. Subsequent to the filing of the derivative actions, the Company was notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission of an informal inquiry concerning the Company's stock option grants. The Company has since received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York requesting certain stock option related material. The special committee of the Board is in the process of conducting its investigation and analysis of the claims asserted in the derivative action. The Company said it is cooperating fully with the Board's special committee, the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's office. Because these are on-going legal matters, Jabil management said it cannot comment further at this time.
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On June 21, 2006, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission that contained a copy of a Press Release issued by the Company on the same day in which the Company announced that it was planning to realign its manufacturing capacity. On July 20, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size its manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and that the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives. Based on the analysis done to date, the Company currently expects to recognize approximately $200 to $250 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal years 2007 and 2008. A significant portion of these costs are currently expected to be recorded in the Company's operating results for the fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2006. The Company currently expects that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs will be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. The charges related to the Restructuring Plan, excluding asset impairment charges, are currently expected to result in cash expenditures that will be payable over the course of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more amendments to this Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
In connection with the Restructuring Plan described in Item 2.05 above, the Company is performing an impairment assessment on certain long-term assets (including property, plant and equipment and net deferred tax assets) held by each facility impacted by the Restructuring Plan. Assets that are determined to be impaired will be written down to fair value. At this time, the Company is unable to make a final determination of the estimated range related to the impairment charges. However, to the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more amendments to this Current Report on Form 8-K or include such disclosures in future Forms 10-Q and 10-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of the related costs and charges are finalized. The impairment charges ultimately recorded are not expected to result in material future cash expenditures.
Item 5.03. Amendments Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On July 20, 2006, the Board amended Section 4.1 of the Company's Bylaws to expressly permit Board committees to consist of one member. A copy of the Company's Bylaws, as amended, is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at 9:00 a.m. on the first Thursday of the fourth calendar month after the end of the corporation's fiscal year.

At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.
SPECIAL MEETING
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president, or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than a majority of the votes at that meeting.
If a special meeting is requested by any person or persons other than the board of directors or the president or the chairman of the board, then the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The board of directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than 35 nor more than 120
 
days after the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and the place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 of these bylaws. If the notice is not given within 61 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice.

Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. If no such address appears on the corporation's books or is given, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent to that stockholder by mail or telegraphic or other written communication to the corporation's principal executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is located. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or either means of written communication.
If any notice addressed to a stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the stockholder at that address, then all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available to the stockholder on written demand of the stockholder at the principal executive office of the corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice.
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
QUORUM
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders. The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.6 of these bylaws.
When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of these bylaws. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the proposal; but, if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled to vote.
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.
VALIDATION OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE; CONSENT

The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders maybe taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action by written consent may be taken following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of securities of the corporation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat or entitled to give consent to corporate action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any such action without a meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote or to give consents, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
PROXIES
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, or by the transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, any other means of electronic transmission, or any other acceptable means under the Delaware General Corporate Laws, to the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
 
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such writing or transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that any such reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. However, no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 (c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3) If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Such inspectors shall:
(a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
receive votes, ballots or consents;
hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;

determine when the polls shall close;
determine the result; and
do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.

Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any
 
such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application or any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 217 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

... Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), a global electronic product solutions company, today reported unaudited net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended August 31, 2006 increased 45 percent to $3.0 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the same period of fiscal 2005. Net revenue for the fiscal year increased 36 percent to $10.3 billion compared to $7.5 billion for fiscal 2005.
St. Petersburg, FL  September 26, 2006
"Strong revenue growth continued in our fiscal fourth quarter," said Timothy Main, Jabil's president and CEO. "The trend to outsourcing continues to be robust and Jabil's position in the marketplace continues to rise. We expect to open fiscal 2007 with another record quarter of revenue in the range of $3.1 to $3.3 billion and expect fiscal 2007 revenue growth of approximately 20 percent. While we regret being unable to provide complete financial details at this time, we do anticipate filing our 10K by the November 14
th
filing deadline," said Main.
Last week, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( the "SEC") publicly issued general guidance for public companies concerning various issues that have arisen in connection with the recent wide spread evaluations by public companies of their historical stock option issuance processes. Jabil is in the process of evaluating this guidance. It is premature to determine whether or not the application of that guidance to the Company's circumstances will result in it recording any additional compensation expense, or that it will cause the Company to determine that it would need to restate financial results for any prior period.
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors appointed a special committee of the Board to review the company's stock options grant practices in response to derivative lawsuits filed concerning certain stock options grants. In addition, a similar derivative lawsuit has been filed in Federal Court, as well as a purported class action securities fraud lawsuit concerning historical statements the Company has made with respect to stock options. The special committee of the Board is in the process of conducting its investigation and analysis of the claims asserted in the derivative action. Jabil is cooperating fully with these on-going investigations of the Board's special committee, the SEC's informal inquiry on stock option grants and the subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding certain stock option-related material. The Company does not anticipate having any additional comment on this topic until it makes its next filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Restructuring:
Jabil accrued costs for its previously announced realignment of manufacturing capacity plans during the fourth quarter. The company recognized restructuring and impairment charges of $84.6 million in connection with the restructuring plans along with a deferred tax valuation allowance totaling $35.6 million associated with such plans.

Discussions with impacted employees and their representatives are underway and the Company is complying with all required statutory and consultation periods. Based upon the information available at this time, the Company estimates that it will record additional costs throughout fiscal 2007 with the majority of these costs being recorded near the end of fiscal 2007. Cash outlays associated with these activities are estimated to occur in the second half of fiscal 2007 and through fiscal 2008.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities and
Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
On July 20, 2006, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission that contained disclosure surrounding a restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size its manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $200 to $250 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal year 2007, but that it had not finalized the exact timing of the charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type. The $200 to $250 million range includes pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs, fixed asset impairment costs, other related restructuring costs and valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for certain plants impacted by the Restructuring Plan. Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a final determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 has been made.
The Company expects to record approximately $120.2 million of the $200 to $250 million estimated range during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities and material impairments. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $81.2 million includes employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs. The expected material impairment costs include valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of approximately $35.6 million and fixed asset impairment cost of approximately $3.4 million.
The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and that the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
Cash expenditures of approximately $1.5 million related to the Restructuring Plan were made in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, including $1.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs and $0.2 million related to contract termination costs. The remaining cash expenditures related to the Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges and tax valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets, are currently expected to be made in the second half of fiscal year 2007 and through fiscal year 2008. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows, have not been finalized.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously disclosed, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") is involved in several shareholder derivative and purported securities class action lawsuits in connection with certain historical stock option grants. The Company also is responding to an informal inquiry from the SEC and has received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York that relate to such grants. In light of these developments, the Company, through its legal counsel, who are being assisted by accounting advisors, has been evaluating its historical stock option grant practices. That evaluation is not complete. Separately, a Special Review Committee ("SRC") of the Company's Board of Directors was appointed to review the allegations in the derivative actions. The SRC's review is not complete.
The issues under review principally reflect changes in the Company's understanding of the requirements for identifying appropriate measurement dates for option grants as defined in relevant accounting guidance or errors in interpreting such guidance, and administrative and logistical errors made in effecting the options program. However, the Company's review of these matters is ongoing and not complete.
As a result of its ongoing review, on November 7, 2006, the Company concluded that it will need to restate its 2005 financial statements and related disclosures. The Company's 2005 financial statements and related disclosures, including the 2005 Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, should no longer be relied upon. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not conclusively determined which other time periods may need to be restated or the exact amount of the restatements or the impact of any related tax consequences of these differences in measurement dates. The Company has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with its independent registered public accountants.
Upon the conclusion of its evaluation, the Company intends to file any financial statements required to be restated, as well as its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending August 31, 2006, as soon as practicable.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 22, 2006, Jabil Circuit (Taiwan) Limited ("Merger Sub"), a Taiwan corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil"), entered into a merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Green Point"), a Taiwan corporation whose stock is traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The Merger Agreement contemplates that the Merger Sub would commence an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Green Point (the "Green Point Shares") at a purchase price of NT$109 per share in cash (the "Offer"). Green Point has represented that there are 265,708,828 Green Point Shares outstanding and 1,516,500 Green Point Shares issuable upon the exercise of the vested employee stock options to purchase Green Point Shares. The Offer commenced on November 24, 2006 and is currently expected to stay open for 50 days. The closing of the Offer is subject to various closing conditions, including (i) obtaining all necessary governmental approvals, such as competition clearance under the laws of Taiwan and China, (ii) obtaining at least a majority of the outstanding Green Point Shares being tendered pursuant to the Offer, (iii) that there is no material event or change in the financial or business condition of Green Point (including a material untrue disclosure or omission in financial statements filed or published by Green Point, and other business related documents), and (iv) no other event has occurred that would cause applicable government agencies to require the Merger Sub to terminate or cancel the Offer. Shareholders of Green Point owning approximately 42.7% of the outstanding Green Point Shares have entered into agreements under which they have agreed to tender their shares in the Offer.
Assuming that the Offer is successfully closed, Green Point will merge into Merger Sub (the "Merger") pursuant to the Merger Agreement provided that all other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (many of which are similar to the conditions to the closing of the Offer) have been met, including, without limitation, the approval of the Merger by Green Point's shareholders after the Offer closes (unless more than 90% of the outstanding shares are tendered, in which case no shareholder approval is required) and there not being certain breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of Green Point contained in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that Green Point shareholders will receive NT$109 in cash per Green Point Share. The Merger Agreement also contains various limitations on Green Point's operation of its business prior to the closing of the Merger. If the Offer is not successfully closed by March 2, 2007 or the Merger is not closed by July 15, 2007, then either party may terminate the Merger Agreement.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On November 222006, Jabil issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

...Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), a global electronic product solutions company, announced today that it is going to launch a tender offer to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. (3007.TW) for NT$109 per share in cash through a wholly-owned Jabil subsidiary. The acquisition includes nine Asian plants, including seven located in China and one in both Taiwan and Malaysia.
St. Petersburg, FL  November 22, 2006
"We are thrilled to announce this deal with Green Point Enterprises  a market leader in advanced electro-mechanical manufacturing and services for the mobile product and consumer market," said Tim Main, President and CEO of Jabil. "Green Point has significant scale in the design and production of advanced plastics and metals for the mobile products market. When combined with Jabil's global infrastructure, systems and electronic expertise, we will possess a market leading end-to-end capability with outstanding long-term growth prospects," said Main.
Per the proposed agreement, approximately 30,000 Green Point employees will join Jabil, including the current management team. The Green Point name will be retained and will operate as an independent business within Jabil. Jabil and Green Point management will work together to jointly market the integrated services.
"Acquiring Green Point is a natural extension of Jabil's business strategy to provide sector-specific supply chain solutions to our diversified base of customers," said Main. "Our growth strategy contemplates diversification of end-markets served and providing a best in class end-to-end solution within each of those segments. Electro-mechanical integration in the consumer and mobile products market is consistent with this strategy." Main said Jabil would continue to utilize a well-developed set of strategic component suppliers in our other segments.
 
Jabil To Launch Tender Offer

November 22, 2006
The acquisition provides Jabil with new capabilities in advanced decoration and coating technologies and will augment existing and new customer relationships. Main said that Jabil must continually evolve its service offerings to the changing global market conditions.
The transaction is structured as a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Green Point followed by a merger. It is currently anticipated that the tender offer will be launched on Thursday, November 23, 2006 in Taiwan and remain open for 50 days. The tender offer may be extended or withdrawn for certain reasons. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including competition clearance under the laws of Taiwan and China and acquisition of a majority of the outstanding Green Point shares in the tender offer. Shareholders owning approximately 42.7% of the outstanding shares of Green Point common stock have entered into agreements under which they have agreed to tender their shares to Jabil. Assuming that the Tender is successfully closed, it is then anticipated that the two companies will merge pursuant to a merger agreement between them that provides any remaining shareholders NT$109 cash per share. Completion of the merger, which would be subject to approval by Green Point's shareholders after the tender closes (unless more than 90% of the outstanding shares are tendered, in which case no shareholder approval is acquired), would be expected to take place in Jabil's fiscal third quarter. The purchase price, depending upon final shares outstanding and the exchange rate at the time of the closing is anticipated to be between $875 and $900 million.
Citigroup is acting as an exclusive financial advisor to Jabil in this transaction.

Additional Information
The tender offer described in this press release has not yet commenced, and this press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On November 15, 2006 Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in order to extend the due date for its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 (the "2006 Form 10-K") to November 29, 2006 (the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date for the 2006 Form 10-K). As disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 14, 2006, Jabil has concluded that it must restate at least its 2005 financial statements, and that it was continuing to evaluate which other time periods need to be restated and the exact amount of the restatements. Jabil has not filed the 2006 Form 10-K and, as a result, on December 1, 2006, Jabil received a letter (the "Notice Letter") from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") notifying it that it is subject to the procedures specified in Section 802.01E (SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria) of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual. This section states that the NYSE will monitor Jabil and the filing status of its 2006 Form 10-K. If Jabil has not filed its 2006 Form 10-K within six months of the filing due date of the 2006 Form 10-K (as extended by Form 12b-25), the NYSE will determine whether Jabil should be given up to an additional six months to file its 2006 Form 10-K. If the NYSE determines that such an additional time period is not appropriate, suspension and delisting procedures would be commenced pursuant to Section 804.00 of the Listed Company Manual. Jabil intends to file its 2006 Form 10-K, as well as any other financial statements required to be restated, as soon as practicable upon the conclusion of its evaluation of its historical financial statements.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
In compliance with Section 802.01E of the Listed Company Manual, Jabil issued a press release on December 8, 2006 in response to the Notice Letter that it received from the NYSE. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing, unless otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our finalization of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the status of the listing of our stock on the New York Stock Exchange and the status of our 5 percent Notes. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the finalization of our fiscal year 2006 financial statements and the audit thereof, including those portions relating to our historical stock option grants; the results of the review of our past stock option grants being conducted by a Special Committee of our Board and Governmental Authorities and the review of our other historical financial statements by us and our Audit Committee; the accuracy of the stated dates of our historical option grants and whether all proper corporate and other procedures were followed; the impact of any restatement of our financial statements or other actions that may be taken or required; risks and costs inherent in litigation, including that related to our historical stock option grants or any restatement of the financial statements as a result of the evaluation of our historical stock option practices and financial statements; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), a global electronic product solutions company, announced today that it was not able to file its annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 by November 29, 2006, the date by which the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") required Jabil to file its 2006 Form 10-K in order for it be considered to have filed it in a timely manner.
St. Petersburg, FL  December 8, 2006
As previously disclosed, Jabil is involved in several shareholder derivative and purported securities class action lawsuits in connection with certain historical stock option grants. Jabil is also responding to an informal inquiry from the SEC and has responded to a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York that relate to such grants. Separately, a Special Review Committee of Jabil's Board of Directors was appointed to review the allegations in certain of the derivative actions. Jabil said it is cooperating fully with the Special Review Committee, the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's office. In light of these developments, Jabil, through its legal counsel, assisted by accounting advisors, has been evaluating its historical stock option grant practices. The evaluation is not complete. The Special Review Committee has largely completed its investigation of the allegations in the shareholder derivative suits it is acting in response to, and has authorized Jabil to announce the following:
"The Special Review Committee has concluded that there is no merit to the allegations in the State Court derivative complaints that Jabil's officers issued themselves backdated stock options or attempted to cause others to issue them."
As a result of Jabil's ongoing review of these matters, Jabil announced on November 14, 2006 that it had concluded that it would need to restate at least its 2005 financial statements and related disclosures, and that it had not conclusively determined if financial statements for other time periods might need to be restated nor the exact amount of required restatements. Historical stock options grants that could merit an adjustment to Jabil's historical financial statements date back to 1996. However, Jabil has thus far only determined that such adjustments are sufficiently material so as to require it to restate its 2005 financial statements. Jabil and its Audit Committee continue to evaluate the impact of Jabil's historical stock option grant practices on its financial statements for the periods at issue. They are also reviewing unrelated matters for the periods covered by such financial statements. Thus far, no stock option related or unrelated issue reviewed has been determined to be sufficiently material to lead them to conclude that any additional financial statements need to be restated. However, because the review of such financial statements remains ongoing, there can be no assurance that it will not be determined that additional financial statements may need to be restated due to historical option practices or unrelated events. Jabil will not be in a position to determine the timing of the filing of its 2006 Form 10-K until the evaluation of its historical financial statements has been completed and its independent registered public accounting firm is able to complete its audit of the financial statements to be included in such Form 10-K.

Jabil Provides Update On Its Form 10-K Filing
Add One
As a result of Jabil not timely filing its 2006 Form 10-K, Jabil received a letter on December 1, 2006 from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") notifying it that it is subject to the NYSE procedures pursuant to which the NYSE will monitor Jabil and the filing status of its 2006 Form 10-K. If Jabil has not filed its 2006 Form 10-K within six months of the filing due date (as extended by Form 12b-25), the NYSE will determine whether Jabil should be given up to an additional six months to file its 2006 Form 10-K. If the NYSE determines that such an additional time period is not appropriate, suspension and delisting procedures could be commenced.
The lenders under Jabil's unsecured revolving credit facility agreed to waive, without charging a fee, the requirement that Jabil deliver to the lenders its quarterly and annual financial statements until February 2, 2007. Approximately $220 million in borrowings are outstanding under that credit facility. In addition, the indenture governing Jabil's $300 million of 5 percent Notes requires Jabil to deliver its 2006 Form 10-K to the bond trustee within 15 days of the deadline for filing the 2006 Form 10-K with the SEC (as extended by Form 12b-25). Hence, if that does not occur by December 14, 2006, the holders of 25 percent of the outstanding amount of the 5 percent Notes could require Jabil to deliver the 2006 Form 10-K within 60 days, and if Jabil fails to satisfy such delivery requirement they can attempt to accelerate the 5 percent Notes to be immediately due. Jabil is assessing what acts it might take in response to those developments should they occur, which could include seeking a waiver of the requirement to deliver its 2006 Form 10-K, repaying the 5 percent Notes or contesting the ability of the 5 percent Notes to be accelerated.
Finally, Jabil's annual shareholders meeting, which was scheduled for mid-January, 2007, will be rescheduled for a later date that will be determined after it files its 2006 Form 10-K.
Jabil does not anticipate having any additional comment on these topics until it makes its next filing with the SEC.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 21, 2006, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured bridge credit agreement (the "Bridge Facility"). The Bridge Facility was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent; and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, ABN Amro Bank N.V. and SunTrust Bank, each as a co-documentation agent. Each of the named agents under the Bridge Facility is an agent and a lender under the existing five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was entered into on May 11, 2005. Some or all of the lenders under the Bridge Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. In addition, the Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. The Bridge Facility expires on December 20, 2007. Of the Bridge Facility, $900.0 million is designated for use by the Company as a one-time borrowing (which may be taken down in increments) to finance the tender offer for and merger with Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Limited, a Taiwanese entity, and to pay related costs and expenses, and the remaining $100.0 million of the Bridge Facility is a revolving facility to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. Interest and fees on Bridge Facility advances are based on the Company's unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at either a rate equal to 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or a rate equal to 0.55% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility. The applicable margin for the base rate and the Eurocurrency rate may be increased by 0.25% or 0.50% per annum, depending on the length of time that the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and depending on whether the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended August 31, 2006, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date in question. Fees include unused commitment fees based on the amount of each lender's commitment minus the principal amount of any outstanding advances made by the lender. Based on the Company's current unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest on a full Eurocurrency rate draw would be the base rate or 0.625% above the Eurocurrency rate, as defined above. The Bridge Facility is unsecured and includes various covenants, limitations and events of default currently customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. As of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, no initial draw under the Bridge Facility has been made.
The Bridge Facility does not replace existing debt of the Company.
The foregoing description of the Bridge Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Bridge Facility, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2006 fiscal year.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
 
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January 12, 2007, Jabil Circuit (Taiwan) Limited ("Merger Sub"), a Taiwan corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil"), successfully completed its previously-announced tender offer to acquire up to 100% of the shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Green Point"), a Taiwan corporation whose stock is traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (the "Offer"). Pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub acquired approximately 260.9 million shares, which represents over 97.6% of Green Point's outstanding shares, at a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$870.7 million total based on current exchange rates).
Merger Sub will acquire the remaining outstanding Green Point shares through a merger of Green Point with and into Merger Sub pursuant to the merger agreement entered into on November 22, 2006 (the "Merger"), provided that certain conditions are met, including, but not limited to: the approval of the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Commission and the completion of the delisting process. The Green Point shareholders remaining after the Offer will receive NT$109 per share as a result of the Merger. In addition, because Merger Sub acquired more than 90% of Green Point's outstanding shares in the Offer, approval of the Merger by the remaining Green Point shareholders is not required.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information contained in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
On January 12, 2007, in order to secure the funds necessary to complete the Offer, Jabil borrowed US$870.7 million on its $1.0 billion unsecured bridge agreement (the "Bridge Facility"), which was subsequently loaned to Merger Sub. The Bridge Facility terminates on December 20, 2007. Interest and fees on Bridge Facility draws are payable periodically and are based on Jabil's unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at either a rate equal to 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or a rate equal to 0.55% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility. The applicable margin for the base rate and the Eurocurrency rate may be increased by 0.25% or 0.50% per annum, depending on the length of time that the Bridge Facility remains outstanding and depending on whether Jabil's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2006 fiscal year has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date in question.
A more detailed summary of the Bridge Facility is provided in Jabil's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 28, 2006, and a copy of the Bridge Facility will be attached to Jabil's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2006 fiscal year.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On January 15, 2007, Jabil issued a press release announcing the completion of the Offer and the draw of funds on the Bridge Facility to finance the Offer, as well as certain other information. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing.

...Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), a global electronic product solutions company, announced the successful completion today of the previously-announced tender offer by one of its wholly owned subsidiaries to acquire up to 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. for NT$109 per share. As of January 12, 2007, approximately 261 million shares of stock were acquired, representing over 97.6 percent of Taiwan Green Point's outstanding shares. The tender offer expired as scheduled and was not extended. The total amount paid for the tendered shares was approximately $US 871 million, based on current exchange rates. The entire purchase for the shares was borrowed under Jabil's $1.0 billion unsecured bridge credit agreement.
St. Petersburg, FL  January 15, 2007
It is intended that the remaining Taiwan Green Point shares will be acquired through the merger of Taiwan Green Point into Jabil's wholly-owned subsidiary as per the merger agreement signed and announced on November 22, 2006, provided that certain closing conditions are met.
These conditions include the approvals from the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Commission and completion of the delisting process. These conditions are expected to be met in April, 2007. Formal approval of the merger by Taiwan Green Point's shareholders is not required because over 90 percent of Taiwan Green Point's outstanding shares were acquired through the tender offer. The remaining shareholders will receive NT$109 in cash for their shares at the closing of the merger.
Approximately 30,000 Taiwan Green Point employees will join Jabil, including the current management team. The Green Point name will be retained and will operate as an independent business within Jabil. Jabil and Taiwan Green Point management will jointly market their integrated services.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acted as the financial advisor to Jabil in this transaction, and Holland & Knight LLP assisted by Tsar & Tsai acted as Jabil's legal counsel on the transaction.

St. Petersburg, FL  March 22, 2007
(Jabil is not yet able to provide GAAP results. Jabil will be able to file its 2006 Form 10-K once Jabil's Board of Directors' Audit Committee has concluded its evaluation of Jabil's historical financial statements and Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm is able to complete its audit of the financial statements to be included in Form 10-K.)
Taiwan Green Point Acquisition update:
On January 15, 2007 Jabil utilized approximately $870 million from its credit facility to acquire 97.5 percent of the shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises. The remaining minority interest shares will be purchased with finalization of the acquisition, which is expected during the last week of April, depending upon the timing of government approvals. Transition plans are ongoing.
Restructuring update:
Jabil estimates the associated cost for the previously announced restructuring will be at the high end of its estimated range of $200 to $250 million ($150 to $200 million cash cost). The realignment is on schedule and Jabil still anticipates the restructuring to take place during the course of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008.
Other Fiscal Second Quarter 2007 details:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q2 2007 Jabil Revenue Add One
March 22, 2007
Guidance update:
The Company said it currently expects revenue for its third fiscal quarter of 2007 to range from $2.9 to $3.0 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 2.5 to 3.0 percent, and anticipated core earnings per share in a range of $0.17 to $0.23 per diluted share. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), earnings per share are estimated to be $(0.08) to $0.04 per diluted share.(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 are currently estimated to include $0.01 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.05 per share for stock-based compensation and $0.13 to $0.19 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
In addition, Jabil said its fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 revenue should be in a range of $2.9 to $3.0 billion, with estimated core operating margin in a range of 3.25 to 3.75 percent, and core earnings per share anticipated to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.34 per diluted share. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), earnings per share are estimated to be $0.18 to $0.28 per diluted share.(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 are currently estimated to include $0.01 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.04 per share for stock-based compensation and $0.01 to $0.06 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
(Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. See the additional information in the supplemental information below.)
Other Matters:
As previously disclosed, Jabil is involved in several lawsuits and has received inquiries from the government in connection with certain historical stock option grants. As disclosed on December 8, 2006, Jabil's Board of Directors' Special Review Committee, created to review backdating allegations, authorized the company to announce that the committee has concluded that there was
no merit to the allegations that Jabil's officers issued themselves backdated stock options or attempted to cause others to issue them.
The Audit Committee of Jabil's Board of Directors is still reviewing the recognition of certain revenue by Jabil in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. At this time the Audit Committee's review of these matters is still ongoing. The committee will continue to evaluate the company's historical recognition of revenue in a manner and for such periods as it determines may be appropriate.
Supplemental Information:
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

ITEM: Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities and Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
On July 20, 2006, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "July 8-K") with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding a restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size its manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $200 to $250 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal year 2007, but that it had not finalized the exact timing of the charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type. The $200 to $250 million range includes pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs, fixed asset impairment costs, other related restructuring costs and valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for certain plants impacted by the Restructuring Plan. Subsequently, on September 28, 2006, the Company filed an amendment to the July 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's second fiscal quarter of 2007 has been made and the timing of the remaining charges to be incurred by the Company is now expected to be over the course of fiscal year 2007 and during the first half of fiscal year 2008.
The Company expects to record approximately $133.0 million of the $200 to $250 million estimated range during the Company's three consecutive fiscal quarters ended February 28, 2007, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities and impairments. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $88.0 million includes employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs. The expected impairment costs include valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of approximately $35.6 million and fixed asset impairment cost of approximately $9.4 million.
The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
Cash expenditures of approximately $44.2million related to the Restructuring Plan were made in the Company's three consecutive fiscal quarters ended February 28, 2007, including $40.9million related to employee severance and benefit costs, $2.9 million related to contract termination costs and $0.4 related to other related restructuring costs. The remaining cash expenditures related to the Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges and tax valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets, are currently expected to be made in the second half of fiscal year 2007 and through fiscal year 2008. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows has not been finalized.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM: Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously disclosed, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") is involved in shareholder derivative and purported securities class action lawsuits and has received inquiries from the government regarding certain of its historical stock option grants. In light of those developments, the Company, through its legal counsel assisted by accounting advisors, undertook an evaluation of certain of its historical stock option grant practices. Separately, a Special Review Committee (the "SRC") of the Company's Board of Directors was also appointed to review the allegations in the derivative actions.
The SRC concluded, as previously announced, that there was no merit to allegations that the Company's officers issued themselves backdated stock options or attempted to cause others to issue them. However, the Company did disclose in a Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2006 that as a result of the review of its historical stock option grant practices it concluded that its 2005 statements and related disclosures should no longer be relied upon. The Company stated in that filing that the review of its historical stock option grant practices was ongoing and not yet complete. As a result of the ongoing review, on March 21, 2007 the Company similarly concluded that its 2003 financial statements and related disclosures should not be relied upon. In addition, as discussed below, the Company plans to adjust its 2004 financial statements by an immaterial amount.
The Company's review of its historical stock option practices confirmed that the Company in almost all instances used the date on which committees of its Board of Directors met or acted to consider long-term compensation grants for purposes of determining both stock option exercise prices and the accounting measurement dates for purposes of calculating stock-related compensation charges. However, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued recent guidance clarifying that if options are approved for a group of employees the accounting measurement date for those options does not occur until the list of recipients and the amount of their awards are final. In some instances, the amount of each Company employee's option award was not finalized until after the Board committee acted and, as a result, the Company incorrectly calculated stock-related compensation charges. In other instances, the Company misapplied certain accounting guidance or administrative errors or other events occurred that contributed to it not recording stock-related compensation charges discussed in this filing.
The Company currently estimates that it will record approximately $54.3 million of aggregate incremental non-cash stock-related compensation charges for the fiscal years 1996 through August 31, 2005. Of that amount, it is estimated that the incremental charge for 2005 will be approximately $35.0 million and that for 2003 it will be approximately $16.2 million, with there being aggregate additional estimated incremental charges for fiscal years 1996 through 2002 of approximately $8.4 million. For fiscal year 2004 there will be a reduction in expense of approximately $5.3 million. All of these amounts are prior to any tax benefit related to the adjustments.
Of the $54.3 million of incremental compensation expense for the 1996-2005 period, approximately $48.9 million was related to options granted to employees that were neither executive officers nor directors of the Company at the time the grants were made and approximately $1.7 million related to various options granted to individuals that were executive officers of the Company at the time the grants were made. The remaining $3.7 million related to options granted to a director over a period of five years for his providing consulting services to the Company on its merger and acquisition activities. In that instance, the Company misapplied existing accounting guidance and recorded part, but not all, of the expense associated with those grants.
The Company currently anticipates availing itself of recent guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission when it files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending August 31, 2006 (the "2006 10-K"). Pursuant to such guidance, the Company anticipates that the amount of incremental stock-related compensation credit and charge for its 2004 and 2005 fiscal years, respectively, will be recorded in audited restated financial statements in the 2006 10-K, and that the incremental charges for the 1996 through 2003 fiscal years will be recorded in the aggregate as an opening balance sheet adjustment for 2004. The five years of selected financial data in the 2006 10-K will reflect the additional charges for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 as well, with the additional charges for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 reflected as an opening balance sheet adjustment for 2002.
 
The Company's evaluation of its historical stock option grant practices has largely been completed. The Company continues to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission in its inquiry. In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company continues to evaluate certain of its historical recognition of revenue for certain periods. Accordingly, the Company is not yet able to finalize its financial statements for the periods discussed in this filing. Hence, the disclosure provided in this filing represents the Company's preliminary unaudited conclusions.
The Company has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with its independent registered public accountants.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January 17, 2007, Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that on January 12, 2007, its indirect wholly-owned Taiwanese subsidiary, Jabil Circuit (Taiwan) Limited ("Merger Sub"), through a previously-announced tender offer, acquired approximately 260.9 million shares of Taiwan Green Point Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Green Point") (which represented approximately 97.6% of Green Point's outstanding shares) at a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$870.7 million based on then-current exchange rates). Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer and prior to the completion of the acquisition, Merger Sub acquired approximately 2.1 million Green Point shares in block trades for a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$7.0 million based on then-current exchange rates).
The purpose of this Amendment to a Current Report on Form 8-K/A is to announce that on April 24, 2007, Merger Sub completed the acquisition of the approximately 4.1 million remaining outstanding Green Point shares pursuant to the merger agreement entered into on November 22, 2006 (the "Merger"). In completing the Merger, Merger Sub paid a price of NT$109 per share (or approximately US$13.3 million based on then-current exchange rates) to the remaining Green Point shareholders. Merger Sub is now the sole surviving entity of the Merger.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
On July 20, 2006, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "July 8-K") with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding a restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size its manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $200 to $250 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but that it had not finalized the exact timing of the charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type. The $200 to $250 million range includes pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs, fixed asset impairment costs, other related restructuring costs and valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for certain plants impacted by the Restructuring Plan. Subsequently, on September 28, 2006 and March 28, 2007, the Company filed an amendment to the July 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A on each date to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and then the Company's second fiscal quarter of 2007. Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's third fiscal quarter of 2007 has been made. The timing of the remaining charges to be incurred by the Company continues to be expected to be over the course of fiscal year 2007 and through fiscal year 2008.
The Company expects to record approximately $152.0 million of the $200 to $250 million estimated range during the Company's four consecutive fiscal quarters ended May 31, 2007, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $101.8 million and impairments of approximately $58.6 million. These amounts were off-set by $8.4 million of other income related to proceeds received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 in connection with facility closure costs. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $101.8 million includes employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $87.4 million, contract termination costs of approximately $12.8 million and other related restructuring costs of approximately $1.6 million. The expected impairment costs of approximately $58.6 million include valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of approximately $37.1 million and fixed asset impairment cost of approximately $21.5 million.
The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
Cash expenditures of approximately $57.0 million related to the Restructuring Plan were made in the Company's four consecutive fiscal quarters ended May 31, 2007, including $52.1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, $4.5 million related to contract termination costs and $0.4 million related to other related restructuring costs. The remaining cash expenditures related to the Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges and tax valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets, are currently expected to be made in the second half of fiscal year 2007 and through fiscal year 2008. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows has not been finalized.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 19, 2007, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five year credit agreement (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $800.0 million, subject to potential increases up to $1.0 billion, and provides for a term loan in the amount of $400.0 million (collectively, the "Facility"). The Agreement was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent; and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, N.A., UBS Loan Finance LLC and Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as documentation agents. Some or all of the lenders under the Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition many if not most of the agents and lenders under the Facility hold positions as agent and/or lender under the Company's Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Bridge Agreement, each as defined below. The revolving credit portion of the Facility terminates on July 19, 2012, and the term loan portion of the Facility requires payments of principal in annual installments of $20 million each, with a final payment of the remaining principal due on July 19, 2012. Interest and fees on Facility advances are based on the Company's unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or 0.375% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate or 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the Agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit, and a utilization fee to be added to the interest rate and any letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds 50% of the total revolving credit commitments of the lenders. Based on the Company's current unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest (including the utilization fee) on a full draw under the revolving credit would be 0.075% above the base rate or 0.625% above the Eurocurrency rate, and the current rate of interest on the term loan would be the base rate or 0.625% above the Eurocurrency rate. The Facility includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. As of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, draws in the approximate amount of $320.0 million have been made and are outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the Facility and a draw in the amount of $400.0 million has been made under the term portion of the Facility.
The Agreement amends and restates the Company's five year credit agreement dated May 11, 2005, as amended (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which established a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and was to terminate on May 11, 2010. The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into among the Company, the initial lenders named therein, Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, SunTrust Bank, and ABN Amro Bank N.V., as documentation agents.
Proceeds of the term loan established under the Agreement are being used to pay down a significant portion of the Company's existing $1.0 billion unsecured revolving and non-revolving credit facility, which is to terminate on December 20, 2007, established under the Company's bridge credit agreement dated December 21, 2006, as amended (the "Existing Bridge Agreement"). The revolving portion of the Existing Bridge Agreement was paid off and eliminated. $400 million remains outstanding under the non-revolving portion of the Existing Bridge Agreement. The Existing Bridge Agreement was entered into among the Company, the initial lenders named therein, Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, ABN Amro Bank N.V., and SunTrust Bank, as documentation agents.
Some or all of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Bridge Agreement, and their affiliates, have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition many if not most of the agents and lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Bridge Agreement hold positions as agent and/or lender under the Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

(b) On August 2, 2007, the Board of Directors of Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") approved, effective September 1, 2007, dividing a portion of Jabil's business into a separate Consumer Electronics Division with its Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) business constituting a separate EMS Division. This will also result in changes to certain Jabil officer positions. Scott Brown, Senior Vice President, Jabil Technology Services, who is currently an "executive officer" as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and was a "named executive officer" in our most recently filed proxy statement, will remain with Jabil as Vice President, Strategic Planning, but will no longer be considered an "executive officer" of Jabil effective September 1, 2007.
 
On August 3, 2007, Jabil issued a press release announcing its creation of a separate Consumer Electronics Division, as well as certain other information. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Exhibit 99.1
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the anticipated benefits we and our customers will derive from our new divisional organization. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: whether our new divisional approach will adversely affect our costs and ability to service; our ability to successfully address the challenges associated with integrating our acquisition of Green Point; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; our ability to effectively address certain operational issues that have adversely affected certain of our US operations; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing any rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
.Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), a global electronic product solutions company, today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to establish a Consumer Electronics division and an EMS division. The Consumer division will be formed to meet the distinct needs of the consumer marketplace. The EMS division will continue to provide world class end to end supply chain solutions for customers in a broad range of industry sectors. The change is effective September 1, 2007.
St. Petersburg, FL  August 3, 2007
"We believe that we will unleash even more creative and cost-effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions, each with full ownership and accountability for design, operations, supply chain and delivery," said Timothy L. Main, Jabil's President & CEO. "Our business has grown to a size and scale that we believe provides the critical mass to make this free standing division approach successful."
Consumer Division
Jabil will establish the Consumer Electronics division with dedicated resources designed to meet the unique needs of the consumer products industry. The division will address the marketplace needs of mobility (cell phones and mobile products), connected displays (televisions), set-top boxes and peripheral products. Dedicated design resources combined with vertically integrated supply chain solutions and certain existing and planned manufacturing operations, will provide a full complement of assets to provide low cost solutions for consumer electronics customers.
Seventeen year Jabil veteran John P. Lovato was named Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Division, effective September 1, 2007. "The consumer electronics sector represents an enormous market opportunity for Jabil as major consumer product companies around the world are adopting outsourcing as their go-to-market strategy. These customers tend to be very product focused and prefer suppliers with deep product knowledge and expertise. They also favor vertical integration of certain technologies and capabilities. Jabil's new divisional focus and the complementary services of Green Point will allow us to address both of these needs," said Lovato.
Jabil Approves Divisional Organization

August 3, 2007
EMS Division
The EMS Division will focus on the traditional and emerging electronic manufacturing services business sectors. Traditional sectors, characterized by a longer-term experience in utilizing the electronics outsourcing model, include networking, computing, storage and telecommunications businesses. Emerging sectors are newer to the outsourcing model and include areas such as automotive, medical, industrial, instrumentation, defense and aerospace. Both traditional and emerging sector customers primarily sell directly to business or organizations and utilize outsourcing as a means of reducing internal design and manufacturing costs while focusing on the core of their business. The EMS Division will be chartered with continuing to grow traditional market business and nurturing the blossoming emerging sectors with cost-effective design, manufacturing and delivery of products to these customers.
The EMS Division will be headed by 15-year Jabil executive William D. Muir, who was named Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the division, effective September 1, 2007. "The new approach will allow enhanced focus on the specific needs of our traditional and emerging market customers," said Bill Muir, Senior Vice President. "We believe this model will add to the agility and responsiveness in delivering sector-specific design, manufacturing, fulfillment and supply chain solutions."
"For over 30 years we have empowered our customer-centric business units to develop customized solutions for our customers. The continued use of our customer-centric model with this divisional approach will more narrowly focus our best people on the unique needs of specific customers and sectors. Our customers and shareholders will benefit as we strive for higher levels of performance with strong diversification and full exposure to the secular trend to an outsourcing model," said Main.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
On July 20, 2006, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "July 8-K") with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding a restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan was approved by the Company's Board of Directors to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size its manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $200 to $250 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and over the course of fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but that it had not finalized the exact timing of the charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type. The $200 to $250 million range includes pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs, fixed asset impairment costs, other related restructuring costs and valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for certain plants impacted by the Restructuring Plan. Subsequently, on September 28, 2006, March 28, 2007, and June 27, 2007, the Company filed amendments to the July 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A on each date to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and then the Company's second and third fiscal quarters of 2007. Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2007 has been made. In addition, the Company has now determined that the resulting restructuring and impairment costs that are expected to be incurred will be toward the high end of the previously disclosed range of $200 to $250 million. The timing of the remaining charges to be incurred by the Company continues to be expected primarily through fiscal year 2008, with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year 2011.
The Company expects to record approximately $189.4 million of the expected $250 million restructuring and impairment charge during the Company's five consecutive fiscal quarters ended August 31, 2007, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $105.1 million and impairments of approximately $84.3 million. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $105.1 million include employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $98.7 million, contract termination costs of approximately $12.8 million and other related restructuring costs of approximately $2.0 million, off-set by approximately $8.4 million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs. The expected impairment costs of approximately $84.3 million includes valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of approximately $35.1 million and fixed asset impairment costs of approximately $49.2 million. Of the remaining approximately $60.6 million that the Company expects to record in connection with the Restructuring Plan primarily in fiscal year 2008, it expects to incur approximately $51.1 million of employee severance and benefit costs, approximately $4.1 million of contract termination costs, approximately $5.2 million of fixed asset impairment costs and approximately $0.2 million of other related restructuring costs.
The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
Cash expenditures of approximately $74.7 million related to the Restructuring Plan were made in the Company's five consecutive fiscal quarters ended August 31, 2007, including approximately $68.2 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, approximately $5.9 million related to contract termination costs and approximately $0.6 million related to other related restructuring costs. These cash expenditures were off-set by cash proceeds of $8.4 million that were received by the Company in connection with facility closure costs.

Exhibit 3.2
 
 
 
 
1.1
REGISTERED OFFICE
The registered office of the corporation shall be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
1.2
OTHER OFFICES
The corporation may maintain offices or places of business at such other locations, both within and without the state of Delaware, as the board of directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the corporation may require.
2.1
ANNUAL MEETING
The annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors or for the transaction of such other business as properly may come before such meeting, shall be held at such place, or, within the sole discretion of the board of directors, by remote electronic communication technologies, and at such date and time as may be designated by the board of directors.
2.2
SPECIAL MEETING
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president, or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than a majority of the votes at that meeting.
If a special meeting is requested by any person or persons other than the board of directors or the president or the chairman of the board, then the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The board of directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than 35 nor more than 120 days after the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and the place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 of these bylaws. If the notice is not given within 61 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.2 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board of directors may be held.
2.3
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the written notice of any meeting shall be given personally, by mail or by electronic transmission not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the corporation. For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be effective, such stockholder must consent to the corporation's giving notice by that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the corporation. A stockholder's consent to notice by electronic transmission is automatically revoked if the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the secretary of the corporation, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent or other person responsible for giving notice. Notices are deemed given (a) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (c) if by posting on an electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (i) such posting or (ii) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or (d) if by any other form of electronic communication, when directed to the stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
2.4
QUORUM
Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation or by these bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing will not limit the right of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
2.5
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.4 of these bylaws.
When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than 30 days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 of these bylaws. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
2.6
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 of these bylaws. Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
 
If a quorum is present, on each matter other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and actually cast on such subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
2.7
VALIDATION OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE; CONSENT
The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting or approval of the minutes thereof or provides a waiver of notice by electronic transmission. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
2.8
NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT
No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders called in accordance with these bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
2.9
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
2.10
PROXIES
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, or by the transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, any other means of electronic transmission, or any other acceptable means under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such writing or transmission
 
may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that any such reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. However, no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy by any reasonable means by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. Every proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder signing it, except in those cases where applicable law provides that a proxy shall be irrevocable.
2.11
INSPECTORS OF ELECTION
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors or the chief executive officer may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. Inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist in the performance of their duties.
Such inspectors shall:

(b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
(c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
(e) determine the result; and

The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but if the secretary is not present the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting.
2.13

3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3
ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders following his or her election and until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
3.4
REMOVAL, RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if no time is specified, upon receipt by the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
Any director may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented
 
and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
(a) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(b) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

(Definitions used: "GAAP"means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP.

Business Update
The company expects second fiscal quarter of 2008 net revenue in a range of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 2.2 to 2.4 percent. The guidance is consistent with historical seasonal patterns, particularly prevalent in consumer electronics sectors. Guidance suggests a 25 percent increase in year- over-year core operating income and a 4 percent increase in year-over-year revenue. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its second quarter of fiscal 2008 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.20 per diluted share. GAAP loss per share are estimated to be $(0.03) to $0.01 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.09 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
Jabil said it expects fiscal year 2008 net revenue to range from $13.0 billion to $13.4 billion, with full year core operating income estimated to range from 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent or $400 million to $480 million. The company said its core earnings per share are estimated to be $1.20 to $1.50 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.69 to $.99 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.12 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.17 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.22 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
"In the first half of fiscal 2008, we expect core operating income and EBITDA margins well above previous year levels. In the second half of fiscal 2008, we expect to continue our focus on margin expansion, cash flow generation and higher returns on invested capital. As revenue increases in the second half, cash flow generation and margin expansion is expected to be particularly strong," said Main.
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

On December 20, 2007, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") amended (the "Amendment") its existing bridge credit facility that it entered into as of December 21, 2006 (the "Bridge Facility"). As a result of the Amendment, (1) the termination date of the Bridge Facility was extended from December 20, 2007 to June 17, 2008, (2) the Bridge Facility was converted to a $200,000,000 revolving credit facility that is available only if the Company has fully drawn on the revolving credit portion of the Company's existing amended and restated five year unsecured credit facility dated as of July 19, 2007 (the "Credit Facility") and (3) as described below in the third paragraph, certain other portions of the Bridge Facility were also amended (the Bridge Facility, as so amended, shall be referred to herein as the "Amended Bridge Facility"). Also on December 20, 2007, the Company drew $400,000,000 on the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility in order to pay down the full $400,000,000 outstanding under the term loan portion of the Bridge Facility.
Immediately following consummation of the transactions described above, the Company's debt obligations included no amounts outstanding under the Amended Bridge Facility, $545,000,000 outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility and $400,000,000 outstanding under the term loan portion of the Credit Facility (which was previously borrowed by the Company). Based on these amounts outstanding, the Company currently has $255,000,000 available under the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility (which amount could be increased by up to $200,000,000 if agreed to by the lenders under the Credit Facility), and $200,000,000 available under the Amended Bridge Facility (which is only available to be drawn upon once the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility is fully drawn).
The Amendment specifies that the proceeds of the revolving credit advances under the Amended Bridge Facility shall be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Amendment, interest and fees on advances under the Amended Bridge Facility continue to be based on the Company's unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. The interest rate has been increased, such that interest is charged at either a rate equal to 0.300% to 1.500% above the base rate or a rate equal to 1.300% to 2.500% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility. The applicable interest rate, whether based on the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, will be increased by 0.25% on and after March 20, 2008. Fees include extension fees payable on March 20, 2008 and unused commitment fees based on the amount of the lenders' commitments minus the principal amounts of any outstanding advances made by the lenders. Based on the Company's current unsecured long-term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest (excluding the unused commitment fees and other fees) on a Eurocurrency rate draw would be 0.500% above the base rate or 1.500% above the Eurocurrency rate, as defined above.
Citicorp North America, Inc. is the agent under the Amendment and the Bridge Facility, and one of its affiliates is the agent under the Credit Facility. Some or all of the lenders party to the Amendment and the Bridge Facility, and certain of their affiliates, have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. In addition, the Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates.
The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of: (i) the Amendment (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.34 to this Current Report on Form 8-K), (ii) the Bridge Facility (a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.26 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2006 fiscal year) and (iii) the Credit Facility (a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.33 to Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year).

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 16, 2008, Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") completed its offering of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2018 (the "Notes"), pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the pricing of the offering on January 11, 2008 (which Jabil announced in a press release, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K), Jabil entered into a purchase agreement, dated January 11, 2008, with the initial purchasers of the Notes (the "Initial Purchasers").
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 16, 2008, by and between Jabil and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by the Officers' Certificate dated January 16, 2008, that was delivered by certain of Jabil's officers pursuant to Sections 1.2, 3.1 and 3.3 of the Indenture (the "Officers' Certificate").
The Notes will mature on March 15, 2018. Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2008. The interest rate payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the Notes increase or decrease, as provided in the Notes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Jabil and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
Jabil may redeem all or any part of the Notes at its option at any time prior to their maturity by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date): (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a government treasury rate plus 50 basis points.
The Indenture contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants limiting Jabil's ability and/or its subsidiaries' ability to: create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (applicable only to Jabil's "restricted subsidiaries"); guarantee any of Jabil's indebtedness (applicable only to Jabil's subsidiaries); and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture also contains a covenant regarding the repurchase by Jabil of the Notes upon a "change of control triggering event."
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on January 16, 2008, Jabil and the Initial Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which Jabil agreed to use its best efforts to consummate a registered exchange offer for the Notes within 240 days after the issuance of the Notes. If the exchange offer is not completed within such time period, then the annual interest rate of the Notes will increase by 0.25% per annum for the first 60-day period immediately following the last day of such period and by an additional 0.25% per annum thereafter, up to a maximum aggregate additional interest rate of 0.50% per annum, until the exchange offer is completed.
        Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or their affiliates) have various other relationships with Jabil and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. Jabil, along with its subsidiaries has entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the Initial Purchasers (and their affiliates). In addition, all of the Initial Purchasers (or their affiliates) are lenders under either, or both of, Jabil's five-year unsecured credit facility dated July 19, 2007 (the "Credit Facility") and Jabil's bridge facility that it entered into on December 21, 2006 (as amended on December 20, 2007).
 
Jabil intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay a portion of its Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, as lenders under the Credit Facility, will receive all of the net proceeds from the offering.
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of: (i) the Form of Note (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K); (ii) the Indenture (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K); (iii) the Officers' Certificate (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K); and (iv) the Registration Rights Agreement (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K).

Payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Note will be made at the office or agency maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , , that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the related record date; provided further, that, notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if this Note is a Global Security and is held in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depository, payments on this Note will be made to the Depository or its nominee in accordance with the arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and the Depository.
provided
however
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the succeeding pages hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth herein.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, JABIL CIRCUIT, INC. has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company issued under an Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), designated as the 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"), limited to $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. All terms used in this Note set forth below which are not defined herein and which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The interest rate payable on this Note is subject to adjustments from time to time if either of Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to this Note, as set forth below.
If the rating of the Notes from Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency that rates the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the following table with respect to that Rating Agency (as defined below), the per annum interest rate on this Note will increase from that set forth on the face of this Note by the percentage set forth opposite that rating (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency):
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on this Note has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the per annum interest rate on this Note will be decreased such that the per annum interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency); provided that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Ba1" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BB+" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on this Note will be decreased to the per annum interest rate set forth on the face of this Note (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency).
No adjustment in the interest rate of this Note shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if another such Rating Agency rates the Notes (such Rating Agency, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the per annum interest rate on this Note pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment
 
banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the per annum interest rate on this Note shall increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the interest rate of this Note necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on this Note shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the per annum interest rate on this Note be reduced below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note or (2) the total increase in the per annum interest rate on this Note exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The interest rate on this Note will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if this Note become rated "Baa2" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "BBB" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
The Indenture provides for the defeasance of the Notes and certain covenants in certain circumstances.
This Note is unsecured as to payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest, and ranks pari passu with all other unsecured senior indebtedness of the Company.
Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity hereof, as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
In the case where the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect hereto, as the case may be, does not fall on a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest otherwise payable on such day need not be made on such day, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or at Maturity and, unless the Company defaults on such payment, no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or such Maturity, as the case may be, to the date of payment on such next succeeding Business Day. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.
The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund and, except as provided in the Indenture or herein, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to their Stated Maturity.
The Notes are redeemable as a whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 0.50% (50 basis points), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to, but not including, the Redemption Date. The Company will, however, pay the interest installment due on any Interest Payment Date that occurs on or before a Redemption Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding that Interest Payment Date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means [            ] and [            ], or their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary United States Treasury securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Rating Agency" means (i) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the control of the Company, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Company) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means [            ] and [            ], and two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company, and each of their respective successors and any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York City Time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
If (a) the Company shall have on any date (the "Succession Date") consolidated with or merged into, or conveyed or transferred or leased its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any Person which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (b) as result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of such jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or any change in the official administration, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes, which change or amendment becomes effective after the Succession Date or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public on or prior to such Succession Date and is notified to the Company, such continuing Person would be required to pay any Successor Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Notes in respect of any payments that it may be required to make with respect to any Notes and (c) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company or such continuing Person taking reasonable measures available to it, the Company or such continuing Person may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more
 
than 60 days' written notice as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which a continuing Person would be obligated to pay such Successor Additional Amounts were a payment then due in respect of the Notes, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Successor Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Holders of Notes to be redeemed will be given notice of redemption, at their addresses as set forth in the Security Register for the Notes, at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by the Depository, in the case of Notes represented by a Global Security, or by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of the Notes that are not represented by a Global Security.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portion thereof called for redemption.
The payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, this Note shall be deemed to include the payment of Successor Additional Amounts provided for in the Indenture or herein to the extent that, in such context, Successor Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Indenture or this Note.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, if on or prior to Maturity there shall have occurred a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless the Company shall have redeemed the Notes prior to such occurrence, the Company shall, at the option of the Holders thereof, purchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes for which a Change of Control Purchase Notice shall have been delivered as provided in the Indenture and not withdrawn by a date which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date that a Repurchase Offer Notice is mailed with respect to the occurrence of such Change of Control, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the Change in Control Purchase Date.
Any Holder delivering a Change of Control Purchase Notice shall have the right to withdraw such Change of Control Purchase Notice at any time prior to or on the Change of Control Purchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute such proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder, (iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as is reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and (v) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; , that such limitations do not apply to a proceeding instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, any premium and (subject to certain provisions of the Indenture) interest on, and, if applicable, the Change of Control Purchase Price or any Additional Amounts with respect to, this Note on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed herein, or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of the Holder, on the date such repayment is due, or, in the case of a Change of Control or as to any Change of Control Purchase Notice given timely, on the Change of Control Purchase Date.
provided, however
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the Trustee by entering into an indenture or indentures supplemental thereto with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes. The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, to prospectively waive compliance by the Company with certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture and to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and any interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed by the registered owner hereof or his/her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Holder of this Note is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of January 16, 2008, by and among the Company and the Initial Purchasers, as defined therein, (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event that the Registered Exchange Offer (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not consummated or a Shelf Registration Statement (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to the Notes is not declared effective on or prior to the date that is 240 days after the Closing Date (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) then the interest rate borne by the Notes shall increase by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following such date and by an additional 0.25% per annum thereafter, up to a maximum aggregate additional rate of 0.50% per annum, until the Registered Exchange Offer is consummated or the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of Notes who is not entitled to the benefits of the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be entitled to any increase in the interest rate borne by the Notes as a result of a registration default that pertains to the Shelf Registration Statement. Any New Security (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Note shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Note. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Note and the issue of a New Security in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Note in connection with the exchange.

Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company and any agent of the Trustee or the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 15.6.
 
Without limiting the generality of this Section 1.4, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, a Holder, including a U.S. Depository that is a Holder of a global Security, may make, give or take, by a proxy, or proxies, duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act provided in or pursuant to this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders, and a U.S. Depository that is a Holder of a global Security may provide its proxy or proxies to the beneficial owners of interests in any such global Security through such U.S. Depository's standing instructions and customary practices.
The Company shall fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons who are beneficial owners of interest in any permanent global Security held by a U.S. Depository entitled under the procedures of such U.S. Depository to make, give or take, by a proxy or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act provided in or pursuant to this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders. If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act shall be valid or effective if made, given or taken more than 90 days after such record date.
(2) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing referred to in this Section 1.4 may be proved in any reasonable manner; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
(3) The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Registered Securities held by any Person, and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
(4) The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same, may be proved by the production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as depositary, by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary reasonably acceptable to the Company, wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Company and the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (a) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (b) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, (c) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (d) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership, principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by the Person so executing such instrument or writing and the date of the commencement and the date of the termination of holding the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Company and the Trustee deem sufficient.
 
(5) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of any Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may at its option (but is not obligated to), by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Securities entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of Registered Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders of Registered Securities shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
(6) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such Act is made upon such Security.
Section 1.5.
Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
(1) the Trustee by any Holder or the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or
(2) the Company by the Trustee or any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to the attention of its Treasurer at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
Section 1.6.
Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event,
(1) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Registered Securities if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Registered Security affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice; and
 
(2) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Bearer Securities, if any, if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and, if such Securities are then listed on any stock exchange outside the United States, in an Authorized Newspaper in such city as the Company shall advise the Trustee that such stock exchange so requires, on a Business Day at least twice, the first such publication to be not earlier than the earliest date and the second such publication not later than the latest date prescribed for the giving of such notice.
In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Registered Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given or provided. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification shall be made by overnight courier.
In case by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice mailed to Holders of Registered Securities as provided above.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Section 1.7.
Language of Notices.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that, if the Company so elects, any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
Section 1.8.
Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.
If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with any duties under any required provision of the Trust Indenture Act imposed hereon by Section 318(c) thereof, such required provision shall control.

For purposes of the foregoing, "New York Banking Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed.

from time to time be increased or reduced to reflect exchanges.

(c) all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities and Coupons, if any, have been complied with;
(d) if applicable, this Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and

and
 
(2) an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution, authentication and delivery of such Securities and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, have been complied with and that, to the best knowledge of the Persons executing such certificate, no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time would become, an Event of Default with respect to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing.
If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such opinion and certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series. After any such first delivery, any separate written request by an Authorized Officer of the Company that the Trustee authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue will be deemed to be a certification by the Company that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to authentication and delivery of such Securities continue to have been complied with.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate or to cause an Authenticating Agent to authenticate any Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken.
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security and any Bearer Security in global form shall be dated as of the date specified in or pursuant to this Indenture.
No Security or Coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for in Section 2.2 or 6.11 executed by or on behalf of the Trustee or by the Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. Such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Except as permitted by Section 3.6 or 3.7, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons appertaining thereto then matured have been detached and cancelled.
Section 3.4.
Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and deliver to the Trustee and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner provided in Section 3.3, temporary Securities in lieu thereof which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Such temporary Securities may be in global form.
 
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of the same series and containing terms and provisions that are identical to those of any temporary Securities, such temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at an Office or Agency for such Securities, without charge to any Holder thereof. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and containing identical terms and provisions; , , that no definitive Bearer Security, except as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and , , that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in or pursuant to this Indenture. Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to a temporary global Security, until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

Section 3.5.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
With respect to the Registered Securities of each series, if any, the Company shall cause to be kept a register (each such register being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") at an Office or Agency for such series in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of the Registered Securities of such series and of transfers of the Registered Securities of such series. Such Office or Agency shall be the "Security Registrar" for that series of Securities. Unless otherwise specified in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities, the Trustee shall be the initial Security Registrar for each series of Securities. The Company shall have the right to remove and replace from time to time the Security Registrar for any series of Securities; provided that no such removal or replacement shall be effective until a successor Security Registrar with respect to such series of Securities shall have been appointed by the Company and shall have accepted such appointment by the Company. In the event that the Trustee shall not be or shall cease to be Security Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register for such series at all reasonable times. There shall be only one Security Register for each series of Securities.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any Office or Agency for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture, of a like aggregate principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series containing identical terms and provisions, in any authorized denominations, and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the
 
Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of such series containing identical terms, denominated as authorized in or pursuant to this Indenture and in the same aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any Office or Agency for such series, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an Office or Agency for such series located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such Office or Agency for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series and like tenor after the close of business at such Office or Agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided
however
If provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Bearer Securities upon such terms and conditions as may be provided in or pursuant to this Indenture with respect to such series.
Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange as contemplated by the immediately preceding two paragraphs, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any global Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities only if (i) the Depository is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that such global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. If the beneficial owners of interests in a global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in such form and denominations as are required by or pursuant to this Indenture, and of the same series, containing identical terms and in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such global Security shall be surrendered from time to time by the U.S. Depository or such other Depository as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, and in accordance with instructions given to the Trustee and the U.S. Depository or such other Depository, as the case may be (which instructions shall be in writing but need not be contained in or accompanied by an Officers' Certificate or be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive Securities as described above without charge. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for each portion of such surrendered global Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such global Security to be exchanged, which (unless such Securities are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof, but subject to the satisfaction of any certification or other requirements to the issuance of Bearer Securities; provided, however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of the same series to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and , , that (unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture) no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such global Security shall be returned by the Trustee to such Depository or the U.S. Depository, as the case may be, or such other Depository or U.S. Depository referred to above in accordance with the instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a global Security after the close of business at the Office or Agency for such Security where such exchange occurs on or after (i) any Regular Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date for such Security and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the related proposed date for payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered

Security, but shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such global Security shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and entitling the Holders thereof to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such Security duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge.
Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of any notice of redemption of Securities of like tenor and the same series under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such selection, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except, to the extent provided with respect to such Bearer Security, that such Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of like tenor and the same series, provided that such Registered Security shall be immediately surrendered for redemption with written instruction for payment consistent with the provisions of this Indenture or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which, in accordance with its terms, has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
Section 3.6.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.6, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been
 
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains with all appurtenant Coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen, a new Security of the same series containing identical terms and of like principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6, in case any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or Coupon; , , that payment of principal of, any premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2, be payable only at an Office or Agency for such Securities located outside the United States and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on Bearer Securities and any Additional Amounts with respect to such interest shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto.
provided
however
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 3.6, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security, with any Coupons appertaining thereto issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains shall constitute a separate obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and Coupons appertaining thereto or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series and any Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 3.6, as amended or supplemented pursuant to this Indenture with respect to particular Securities or generally, shall be exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons.
Section 3.7.
Payment of Interest and Certain Additional Amounts; Rights to Interest and Certain Additional Amounts Preserved.
Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, and are punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, in case a Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security after the close of business at an Office or Agency for such Security on any Regular Record Date therefor and before the opening of business at such Office or Agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date therefor, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but shall be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture, any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Registered Security which shall be payable, but shall not be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for such Registered Security (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed by the Company in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on such Registered Security, the Special Record Date therefor and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Person entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. The Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after notification to the Trustee of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall in the name and at the expense of the Company cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holder of such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee shall, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or a Predecessor Security thereof) shall be registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Indenture or the Securities of any particular series pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, at the option of the Company, interest on Registered Securities that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in the United States.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
In the case of any Registered Security of any series that is convertible into shares of Common Stock or exchangeable for other securities, which Registered Security is converted or exchanged after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Registered Security with respect to which the Stated Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion or exchange, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Registered Security (or one or more predecessor Registered Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Registered Security which is converted or exchanged, interest with respect to which the Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion or exchange of such Registered Security shall not be payable.
Section 3.8.
Persons Deemed Owners.

Cancellation.

Section 3.11.
CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing Securities may obtain CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use) or other identifying numbers, and, if so obtained, the Trustee shall use such numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or other identifying numbers.

For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with, and shall have no liability in respect of, any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 5.1(4) or 5.1(9) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and Coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.
(4) The following shall be the conditions to application of clause (2) or (3) of this Section 4.2 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto:

(c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and, with respect to defeasance only, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).
(d) In the case of an election under clause (2) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a letter ruling, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service a Revenue Ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred.
(e) In the case of an election under clause (3) of this Section 4.2, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

Section 4.3.
Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities, and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any; but such money and Government Obligations need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

(c) For the purposes of determining compliance with this Section 10.5, in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Liens described in clause (a) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Liens and only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien in one of the items of clause (a) above and a Lien may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Liens described above.

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that any item of Funded Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may reclassify, such Funded Debt and only be required to include the amount and type of such Funded Debt in one of the above clauses or the immediately preceding paragraph, and an item of Funded Debt may be divided and classified and reclassified into more than one of the types of Funded Debt described above.

If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is (A) pari passu with the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be pari passu with, or subordinated to, the Subsidiary Guarantee or (B) subordinated to the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary may provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any person not an affiliate of the Company, of all of its and each other Subsidiary's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited hereby) or (ii) the release or discharge of the Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.1, in connection with any repayment of Securities, the Company may arrange for the purchase of any Securities by an agreement with one or more

(d) The Company shall use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the qualification of the securities therein for sale in any jurisdiction and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(e) The Company shall furnish to each Holder of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, at least one copy of such Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including all material incorporated therein by reference, and, if the Holder so requests in writing, all exhibits thereto (including exhibits incorporated by reference therein).
(f) The Company shall, during the Shelf Registration Period, deliver to each Holder of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Preliminary Prospectus) included in such Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder may reasonably request.

(h) The Company shall promptly deliver to each Initial Purchaser, each Exchanging Dealer and each other person required to deliver a Prospectus during the Exchange Offer Registration Period, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as any such person may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any Initial Purchaser, any Exchanging Dealer and any such other person that may be required to deliver a Prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer in connection with the offering and sale of the New Securities covered by the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement.

(j) The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing New Securities or Securities to be issued or sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as Holders may request.
(k)(i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by subsections (c)(ii) through (v) above, the Company shall promptly (or within the time period provided for by clause (ii) hereof, if applicable) prepare a post-effective amendment to the applicable Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Initial Purchasers of the securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such circumstances, the period of effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 2 shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of a notice of suspension pursuant to Section 4(c) to and
 
including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Exchanging Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented Prospectus pursuant to this Section.
(ii) Upon the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development or any other material event that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of a Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus, the Company shall give notice (without notice of the nature or details of such events) to the Holders that the availability of the Shelf Registration is suspended and, upon actual receipt of any such notice, each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration until such Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in Section 3(i) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. The period during which the availability of the Shelf Registration and any Prospectus is suspended (the "Deferral Period") shall not exceed 45 days in any three-month period or 90 days in any twelve-month period.
(l) Not later than the effective date of any Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a CUSIP number for the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, registered under such Registration Statement and provide the Trustee with printed certificates for such Securities or New Securities, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company.
(m) The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and shall make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act as soon as practicable after the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement and in any event no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement.
(n) The Company shall cause the New Securities Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in a timely manner.
(o) The Company may require each Holder of securities to be sold pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in such Registration Statement. The Company may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Securities of any Holder that unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
(p) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall enter into customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all other appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or
 
the disposition of the Securities, and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable than those set forth in Section 6 hereof.
(q) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall:
(i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Holders of Securities to be registered thereunder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records and pertinent corporate documents of the Company and its subsidiaries;
(ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any such Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations;

(iv) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters, if any) addressed to each selling Holder and the underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and underwriters;
(v) obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and
(vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders or the Managing Underwriters, if any, including those to evidence compliance with Section 4(k) and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the Company.
 
The actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this paragraph (q) shall be performed at (A) the effectiveness of such Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto; and (B) each closing under any underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder.
(r) In the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall, if requested by an Initial Purchaser, or by a broker dealer that holds Securities that were acquired as a result of market making or other trading activities:

(v) obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to the requesting party, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, or if requested by the requesting party or its counsel in lieu of a "comfort" letter, an agreed-upon procedures letter under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 35, covering matters requested by the requesting party or its counsel; and
(vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the requesting party or its counsel, including those to evidence compliance with Section 4(k) and with conditions customarily contained in underwriting agreements.

(s) If a Registered Exchange Offer is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the New Securities, the Company shall mark, or caused to be marked, on the Securities so exchanged that such Securities are being cancelled in exchange for the New Securities. In no event shall the Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.
(t) The Company shall use its best efforts if the Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Securities, to confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement.
(u) In the event that any Broker-Dealer shall underwrite any Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the FINRA Rules) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company shall assist such Broker-Dealer in complying with the FINRA Rules.
(v) The Company shall use its best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement.
5. . The Company shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof and, in the event of any Shelf Registration Statement, will reimburse the Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel (which shall initially be Sidley Austin LLP but which may be another nationally recognized law firm experienced in securities matters designated by the Majority Holders) to act as counsel for the Holders in connection therewith, and, in the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel acting in connection therewith.
Registration Expenses
,
6. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement, each Initial Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer and each person who controls any such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
Indemnification and Contribution
 
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof.
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party,
 
retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security, or in the case of a New Security, applicable to the Security that was exchangeable into such New Security, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions as set forth on the cover page of the Final Memorandum, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities or New Securities, as
provided
however
 
applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
(e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
7. . (a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders.
Underwritten Registrations
(b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
8. . If any of the following events shall occur, then the Company shall pay liquidated damages (the "Registration Default Damages") to the Holders of Securities in respect of the Securities as follows:
Registration Defaults
(a) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such filing in this Agreement, then Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such specified date and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
 
(b) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date by which best efforts are to be used to cause such effectiveness under this Agreement, then commencing on the day after such specified date, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such specified date and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
(c) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective under this Agreement, then commencing on the day the Registration Statement ceases to be effective, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such date on which the Registration Statement ceases to be effective and 0.50% per annum thereafter;
, , that (1) upon the filing of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (a) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (b) above), or (3) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of paragraph (c) above), Registration Default Damages shall cease to accrue.
provided
however
9. . The Company has not entered into, and agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
10. . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding; that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective; , , that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and , , that the provisions of this Article 10 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Initial Purchasers and each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

Each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided to it herein, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
13. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Company thereto, subsequent Holders of Securities and the New Securities, and the indemnified persons referred to in Section 6 hereof.

Each broker-dealer that receives new securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such new securities. The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of new securities received in exchange for securities where such securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The company has agreed that, starting on the expiration date and ending on the close of business one year after the expiration date, it will make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.

The company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of New Securities by brokers-dealers. New Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the New Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices.

...Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported its preliminary, unaudited financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2008, ended February 29, 2008. "We are pleased with the results from our second quarter, where our employees pulled together in a challenging operating environment. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to meet our expectations for the quarter and generate $134 million in cash from operations," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main.
St. Petersburg, FL  March 25, 2008
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)
Second Quarter 2008
Net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 increased four percent to $3.1 billion compared to $ 2.9 billion for the same period of fiscal 2007.
GAAP operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 96 percent to $1.6 million compared to $36.7 million for the same period of fiscal 2007. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 273 percent to a loss of $24.0 million compared to $13.9 million of net income for the same period in fiscal 2007. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased 271 percent to a loss per share of $0.12 compared to $0.07 of earnings per share for the same period of fiscal 2007. The GAAP income decline was principally due to restructuring charges which were approximately $41 million higher than the comparative period.
Jabil's second quarter of fiscal 2008 core operating income increased 22 percent to $67.8 million or 2.2 percent of net revenue compared to $55.6 million or 1.9 percent of net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Core earnings increased 48 percent to $42.0 million compared to $28.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Core earnings per share increased 43 percent to $0.20 per diluted share for the period compared to $0.14 for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Business Update
"We expect revenue in the second half of fiscal 2008 to be consistent with the first half of the year, resulting in a year of modest growth but below our previous expectations. It appears the slowdown in end markets will reduce our growth rate and impede margin expansion for the next quarter or two. However, we continue to win new business and will stay focused on margin expansion, free cash flow and returns on capital," said Main.
The company expects third fiscal quarter of 2008 net revenue in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 2.3 to 2.6 percent. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its third quarter of fiscal 2008 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.22 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.09 to $0.13 per diluted share.(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges.)
Jabil said it expects fiscal year 2008 net revenue to range from $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion, with full year core operating income estimated to range from 2.8 percent to 3.1 percent or $355 million to $395 million. The company said its core earnings per share are estimated to be $1.00 to $1.16 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.46 to $0.62 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.13 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.19 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.22 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

On May 19, 2008, Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil") completed its offering of $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2018 (the "Notes"), pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are an additional issuance of Jabil's 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 and will be treated under the indenture pursuant to which they were issued as a single series with the outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes that was originally issued on January 16, 2008 (the "January Notes"). In connection with the pricing of the offering on May 14, 2008, Jabil entered into a purchase agreement, dated May 14, 2008, with the initial purchasers of the Notes (the "Initial Purchasers").
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 16, 2008, by and between Jabil and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by the Officers' Certificate dated May 19, 2008, that was delivered by certain of Jabil's officers pursuant to Sections 1.2, 3.1 and 3.3 of the Indenture (the "Officers' Certificate").
The Notes will mature on March 15, 2018. Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2008. The interest rate payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the Notes increase or decrease, as provided in the Notes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Jabil and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
Jabil may redeem all or any part of the Notes at its option at any time prior to their maturity by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date): (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a government treasury rate plus 50 basis points.
The Indenture contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants limiting Jabil's ability and/or its subsidiaries' ability to: create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (applicable only to Jabil's "restricted subsidiaries"); guarantee any of Jabil's indebtedness (applicable only to Jabil's subsidiaries); and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to another person. The Indenture also contains a covenant regarding the repurchase by Jabil of the Notes upon a "change of control triggering event."
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on May 19, 2008, Jabil and the Initial Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "May Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which Jabil agreed to use its best efforts to: (i) cause a registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or before July 14, 2008; and (ii) cause the exchange offer to be consummated on or before September 12, 2008.
If the exchange offer required by the May Registration Rights Agreement or, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement dated January 16, 2008 (the "January Registration Rights Agreement"), the exchange offer with respect to the January Notes is not completed on or before September 12, 2008, Jabil will be required to pay a special interest premium over and above the regular interest of 0.25% per annum on the Notes and the January Notes for the first 60-day period immediately following the last day of such period and of 0.50% per annum thererafter, until the exchange offer is completed. Further to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if Jabil becomes obligated to pay the special interest premium on the Notes or the January Notes, Jabil shall pay the special interest premium on both the Notes and the January Notes.
 
Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or their affiliates) have various other relationships with Jabil and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. Jabil, along with its subsidiaries has entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the Initial Purchasers (and their affiliates). In addition, all of the Initial Purchasers (or their affiliates) are lenders under Jabil's five-year unsecured credit facility dated July 19, 2007 (the "Credit Facility").
Jabil intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of all or a portion of the Credit Facility. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, as lenders under the Credit Facility, may receive all or a portion of the net proceeds from the offering.
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of: (i) the Form of Note (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K); (ii) the Indenture (a copy of which is incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K); (iii) the Officers' Certificate (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K); and (iv) the Registration Rights Agreement (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K).

provided
however
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the succeeding pages hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth herein.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, JABIL CIRCUIT, INC. has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company issued under an Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), designated as the 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). This Note is an additional issuance of Notes that were originally issued on January 16, 2008 in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000 (the "Initial Notes"). The Notes will be treated under the Indenture as a single series with the Initial Notes (the Notes and the Initial Notes referred to collectively as the "Notes," unless the context otherwise requires), which will result in a total outstanding aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 in Notes, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. All terms used in this Note set forth below which are not defined herein and which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The interest rate payable on this Note is subject to adjustments from time to time if either of Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to this Note, as set forth below.
If the rating of the Notes from Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency that rates the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the following table with respect to that Rating Agency (as defined below), the per annum interest rate on this Note will increase from that set forth on the face of this Note by the percentage set forth opposite that rating (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency):
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on this Note has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the per annum interest rate on this Note will be decreased such that the per annum interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency); provided that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Ba1" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BB+" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on this Note will be decreased to the per annum interest rate set forth on the face of this Note (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency).
No adjustment in the interest rate of this Note shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if another such Rating Agency rates the Notes (such Rating Agency, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for
 
purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the per annum interest rate on this Note pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the per annum interest rate on this Note shall increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the interest rate of this Note necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on this Note shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the per annum interest rate on this Note be reduced below the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note or (2) the total increase in the per annum interest rate on this Note exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Note.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The interest rate on this Note will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if this Note become rated "Baa2" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "BBB" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
The Indenture provides for the defeasance of the Notes and certain covenants in certain circumstances.
This Note is unsecured as to payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest, and ranks pari passu with all other unsecured senior indebtedness of the Company.
Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity hereof, as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
In the case where the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect hereto, as the case may be, does not fall on a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest otherwise payable on such day need not be made on such day, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or at Maturity and, unless the Company defaults on such payment, no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or such Maturity, as the case may be, to the date of payment on such next succeeding Business Day. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.
The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund and, except as provided in the Indenture or herein, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to their Stated Maturity.

30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 0.50% (50 basis points), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to, but not including, the Redemption Date. The Company will, however, pay the interest installment due on any Interest Payment Date that occurs on or before a Redemption Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding that Interest Payment Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary United States Treasury securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Rating Agency" means (i) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the control of the Company, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the board of directors of the Company) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company, and each of their respective successors and any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York City Time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
If (a) the Company shall have on any date (the "Succession Date") consolidated with or merged into, or conveyed or transferred or leased its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any Person which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (b) as result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of such jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or any change in the official administration, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes, which change or amendment becomes effective after the
 
Succession Date or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public on or prior to such Succession Date and is notified to the Company, such continuing Person would be required to pay any Successor Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Notes in respect of any payments that it may be required to make with respect to any Notes and (c) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company or such continuing Person taking reasonable measures available to it, the Company or such continuing Person may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided however, that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which a continuing Person would be obligated to pay such Successor Additional Amounts were a payment then due in respect of the Notes, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Successor Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Holders of Notes to be redeemed will be given notice of redemption, at their addresses as set forth in the Security Register for the Notes, at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by the Depository, in the case of Notes represented by a Global Security, or by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of the Notes that are not represented by a Global Security.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portion thereof called for redemption.
The payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, this Note shall be deemed to include the payment of Successor Additional Amounts provided for in the Indenture or herein to the extent that, in such context, Successor Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Indenture or this Note.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, if on or prior to Maturity there shall have occurred a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless the Company shall have redeemed the Notes prior to such occurrence, the Company shall, at the option of the Holders thereof, purchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes for which a Change of Control Purchase Notice shall have been delivered as provided in the Indenture and not withdrawn by a date which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date that a Repurchase Offer Notice is mailed with respect to the occurrence of such Change of Control, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the Change in Control Purchase Date.
Any Holder delivering a Change of Control Purchase Notice shall have the right to withdraw such Change of Control Purchase Notice at any time prior to or on the Change of Control Purchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute such proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder, (iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as is reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and (v) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; , that such limitations do not apply to a proceeding instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, any premium and (subject to certain provisions of the
provided, however
 
Indenture) interest on, and, if applicable, the Change of Control Purchase Price or any Additional Amounts with respect to, this Note on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed herein, or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of the Holder, on the date such repayment is due, or, in the case of a Change of Control or as to any Change of Control Purchase Notice given timely, on the Change of Control Purchase Date.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the Trustee by entering into an indenture or indentures supplemental thereto with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes. The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, to prospectively waive compliance by the Company with certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture and to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed by the registered owner hereof or his/her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Holder of this Note is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2008, by and among the Company and the Initial Purchasers, as defined therein, (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement").

Any New Security (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Note shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Note. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Note and the issue of a New Security in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Note in connection with the exchange.

upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof.
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party,
 
retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided, however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security, or in the case of a New Security, applicable to the Security that was exchangeable into such New Security, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions as set forth on the cover page of the Final Memorandum, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities or New Securities, as
provided
however
 
applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
(e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
7. . (a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders.
Underwritten Registrations
(b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
8. . If any of the following events shall occur, then the Company shall pay liquidated damages (the "Registration Default Damages") to the Holders of Securities in respect of the Securities as follows:
Registration Defaults
(a) if the Registered Exchange Offer required by this Agreement or, pursuant to the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Registered Exchange Offer (as defined in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to the Initial Notes is not completed on or prior to the date specified for such completion in this Agreement and the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement, then Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the
 
Registrable Securities (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such specified date and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
(b) if any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement or the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date by which best efforts are to be used to cause such effectiveness under this Agreement and the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement, then commencing on the day after such specified date, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such specified date and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
(c) if any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement or the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective under this Agreement, then commencing on the day such Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 60 days from and including such date on which the Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective and 0.50% per annum thereafter;
, , that (1) upon the completion of the Registered Exchange Offer (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) (in the case of paragraph (a) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) (in the case of paragraph (b) above), or (3) upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of paragraph (c) above), Registration Default Damages shall cease to accrue.
provided
however
Further to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Company agrees that, to the extent it shall become obligated to pay Registration Default Damages (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) in respect of the Initial Notes or the Securities, it shall pay Registration Default Damages (as defined herein and in the Initial Notes Registration Rights Agreement) in respect of both the Initial Notes and the Securities.
9. . The Company has not entered into, and agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
10. . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding; that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is
Amendments and Waivers
provided
 
to be effective; , , that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and , , that the provisions of this Article 10 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Initial Purchasers and each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

11. . All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail, telex, telecopier or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery:

All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when received.
The Initial Purchasers or the Company by notice to the other parties may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications.
12. . Each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided to it herein, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
13. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Company thereto, subsequent Holders of Securities and the New Securities, and the indemnified persons referred to in Section 6 hereof.

Severability
18. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of principal amount of Securities or New Securities is required hereunder, Securities or New Securities, as applicable, held by the Company or its Affiliates (other than subsequent Holders of Securities or New Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be Affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Securities or New Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage.

EX 99.1
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our third fiscal quarter, improving our margins, cash flow and return on invested capital, the anticipated outlook for our business and our currently expected fourth quarter fiscal year 2008 net revenue and earnings results and components thereof and our fiscal year 2008 net revenue and earnings results and components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our third fiscal quarter fiscal year 2008 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; the Securities and Exchange Commission having views different from ours on the results of the review of our past stock option grants conducted by a Special Committee of our Board and Governmental Authorities and the review of our historical recognition of our revenue by our Audit Committee; risks and costs inherent in litigation, including any pending or future litigation relating to our stock option grants, the restatement of our financial statements as a result of the evaluation of our historical stock option practices and revenue recognition and associated financial statements or any declines on the price of our stock; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to successfully address the challenges associated with integrating our acquisition of Green Point; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing any rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported its preliminary, unaudited financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2008, ended May 31, 2008. "The results from our third quarter were extremely gratifying given the challenging market conditions," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main.
St. Petersburg, FL  June 24, 2008
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)

GAAP operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 88 percent to $63.1 million compared to $33.6 million for the same period of fiscal 2007.

Business Update
Jabil management said it expects net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in a range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 3.0 to 3.3 percent. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.21 to $0.25 per diluted share.(Expected GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges.)
Jabil said it expects fiscal year 2008 net revenue to range from $12.7 billion to $12.8 billion, with full year core operating income estimated to be approximately 3 percent or $370 million to $385 million. The company said its core earnings per share are estimated to be $1.11 to $1.15 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.58 to $0.62 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2008 are currently estimated to include $0.13 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.17 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges and $0.23 per share for restructuring and impairment charges.)
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2008 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; the Securities and Exchange Commission having views different from ours on the results of the review of our past stock option grants conducted by a Special Committee of our Board and Governmental Authorities and the review of our historical recognition of our revenue by our Audit Committee; risks and costs inherent in litigation, including any pending or future litigation relating to our stock option grants, the restatement of our financial statements as a result of the evaluation of our historical stock option practices and revenue recognition and associated financial statements or any declines on the price of our stock; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to successfully address the challenges associated with integrating our acquisition of Green Point; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing any rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
...Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008, ended August 31, 2008.

St. Petersburg, FL  September 26, 2008
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges and restructuring and impairment charges. Jabil defines core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss, net of tax. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income and Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)

Business Update
The company expects first fiscal quarter of 2009 net revenue in a range of $3.40 billion to $3.60 billion, with an estimated core operating margin range of 3.0 to 3.4 percent. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its first quarter of fiscal 2009 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.38 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.20 to $0.28 per diluted share. (GAAP for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 earnings per share are currently estimated to include $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.07 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges.)
"The ramifications of the financial market conditions on the overall global economy are difficult to predict," said Jabil President and CEO Tim Main. "Jabil has diversified its business over a wide range of sectors and we believe this affords us some resilience in a downturn. We remain focused on developing the markets we serve and running efficient operations as we move into the first quarter of fiscal 2009," said Main.
Given the uncertainty in the financial markets, Main also commented on the company's current financial condition. "We have significant liquidity relative to our capital requirements over the next twelve months. In total, we have over $1.5 billion in available cash and credit facilities," he said. "We will continue to focus on capital efficiency as we expand our business in fiscal 2009," Main said.

Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is a Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On October 23, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") amended the Company's Bylaws effective as of such date to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality to a majority voting standard. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Bylaws, included as Exhibit 3.2 to this filing. Exhibit 3.2 is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.03.
 
On October 29, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing the amendment to its Bylaws. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing.
 
 
The following exhibits are furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.2
 
 
 
 
The registered office of the corporation shall be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
 
The corporation may maintain offices or places of business at such other locations, both within and without the state of Delaware, as the board of directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the corporation may require.
 
The annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors or for the transaction of such other business as properly may come before such meeting, shall be held at such place, or, within the sole discretion of the board of directors, by remote electronic communication technologies, and at such date and time as may be designated by the board of directors.
 
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president, or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than a majority of the votes at that meeting.
If a special meeting is requested by any person or persons other than the board of directors or the president or the chairman of the board, then the request shall be in writing, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The board of directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which shall be held not less than 35 nor more than 120 days after the receipt of the request. Upon determination of the time and the place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 of
these bylaws. If the notice is not given within 61 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.2 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board of directors may be held.
 
Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the written notice of any meeting shall be given personally, by mail or by electronic transmission not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the corporation. For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be effective, such stockholder must consent to the corporation's giving notice by that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the corporation. A stockholder's consent to notice by electronic transmission is automatically revoked if the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the secretary of the corporation, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent or other person responsible for giving notice. Notices are deemed given (a) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (c) if by posting on an electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (i) such posting or (ii) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or (d) if by any other form of electronic communication, when directed to the stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
 
Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation or by these bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereat constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is
 
held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing will not limit the right of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
 
Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.4 of these bylaws.
When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than 30 days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 of these bylaws. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 of these bylaws. Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
If a quorum is present, on each matter other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and actually cast on such subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number or a vote by classes is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.
Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and actually cast with respect to the director; provided, however, that if the board of directors determines that the election is contested then directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For the purposes of this Section 2.6, a "majority of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and actually cast" shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes actually cast with respect to that director's election. Votes actually cast shall include votes where the authority to cast a vote for the director's election is explicitly withheld and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election.
 
If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her conditional resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The nominating and corporate governance committee shall consider the resignation offer and recommend to the board of directors whether to accept it. The nominating and corporate governance committee and the board of directors may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. The board of directors will endeavor to act on the nominating and corporate governance committee's recommendation within 90 days following the nominating and corporate governance committee's recommendation. Thereafter, the board of directors will promptly disclose its decision whether to accept the director's resignation offer (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable) in a Report on Form 8-K or by a press release disseminated in the manner that company press releases typically are distributed. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the nominating and corporate governance committee recommendation or board of directors action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. However, if each member of the nominating and corporate governance committee received a majority withheld vote at the same uncontested election, then the independent directors who did not receive a majority withheld vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offer and recommend to the board of directors whether to accept them. However, if the only directors who did not receive a majority withheld vote in the same election constitute three or fewer directors, all directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this Section 2.6, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 of these bylaws or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2 of these bylaws.
 
The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting or approval of the minutes thereof or provides a waiver of notice by electronic transmission. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
 
No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders called in accordance with these bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Article VIII of these bylaws.
 
Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, or by the transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, any other means of electronic transmission, or any other acceptable means under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such writing or transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that any such reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. However, no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy by any reasonable means by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. Every proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder signing it, except in those cases where applicable law provides that a proxy shall be irrevocable.
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors or the chief executive officer may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. If any person appointed as inspector fails to
 
appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. Inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist in the performance of their duties.
Such inspectors shall:
(a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
(b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
(c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
(e) determine the result; and
(f) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
 
Meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the chairman of the board, or in the chairman of the board's absence, the chief executive officer, or in the chief executive officer's absence, by a person designated by the board of directors. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but if the secretary is not present the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting.
 
The chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems in order to the chairman of the meeting.
 
(a) To be properly brought before the annual meeting or special meeting, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors or other business must be either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors; (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record.
 
(b) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of the Section 2.14(a) of these bylaws, (i) the subject matter thereof must be a matter which is a proper subject matter for stockholder action at such meeting; (ii) the stockholder must have been a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the notice required by this Section 2.14 is delivered to the corporation and must be entitled to vote at the meeting; and (iii) the stockholder must have given timely written notice thereof by mail, courier or personal delivery to (A) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors, care of the corporate secretary of the corporation, for nominations, or (B) the corporate secretary of the corporation, for other business. To be considered timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the prior annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting of stockholders for the current year is more than 30 days following the first anniversary date of the annual meeting of stockholders for the prior year, the submission of a recommendation will be considered timely if it is submitted a reasonable time in advance of the mailing of the corporation's proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders for the current year.
A stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, (A) all information relating to such person that is required by Item 401 of the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Regulation S-K; (B) the information required by Item 403 of SEC Regulation S-K; (C) the information required by Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K; (D) a description of all relationships between the proposed nominee and the recommending stockholder and any agreements or understandings between the recommending stockholder and the nominee regarding the nomination; (E) a description of all relationships between the proposed nominee and any of the corporation's competitors, customers, suppliers, labor unions or other persons with special interests regarding the corporation known to the recommending stockholder or nominee in the corporation's filings with the SEC; (F) a statement by the stockholder supporting its view that the proposed nominee possesses the minimum qualifications prescribed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors for nominees or directors from time to time, including those that may be set forth in the corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, and a brief description of the contributions that the nominee would be expected to make to the board of directors and to the governance of the corporation; (G) a statement whether, in the view of the stockholder, the nominee, if elected, would represent all stockholders and not serve for the purpose of advancing or favoring any particular stockholder or other constituency of the corporation; and (H) such nominee's written consent to being interviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors (including the nominee's contact information for this purpose), and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director of the corporation; (ii) as to any other business the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, (A) a brief description of such business and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and (B) any material interest in such business of the stockholder and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal or nomination is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (or, if submitted by a group of two or more stockholders, as to each stockholder in the group), (A) the name and address, including telephone number, of such stockholder; (B) the number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned and held of record by such stockholder and the time period for which such shares have been held; (C) if the
 
stockholder is not a stockholder of record, a statement from the record holder of the shares verifying the holdings of the stockholder and a statement from the stockholder of the length of time that the shares have been held (alternatively, the stockholder may furnish a current Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G, Form 3, Form 4, or Form 5 filed with the SEC reflecting the holdings of the stockholder, together with a statement of the length of time that the shares have been held); and (D) a statement from the stockholder as to whether the stockholder has a good faith intention to continue to hold the reported shares through the date of the corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.14(b) of these bylaws to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.14(c) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14, a stockholder who seeks to have any proposal included in the corporation's proxy materials must provide notice as required by and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.14. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these bylaws, to declare that such business shall not be transacted at such meeting and such nomination shall be disregarded.
 
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
 
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders following his or her election and until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
 
Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if no time is specified, upon receipt by the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
Any director may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws:
(a) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(b) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator,
 
trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application or any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 217 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
 
The annual meeting of the board of directors for the purpose of electing officers and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting shall be held as soon as possible following adjournment of the annual meeting of the stockholders. Annual and regular meetings may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated from time to time by resolution of the board. In the absence of such a designation, annual and regular meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Special meetings of the board may be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice, at the principal executive office of the corporation.
Any meeting may be held by conference telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as all directors participating in the meeting can hear one another, and all such directors shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting.
 
Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two directors.
Notice of regular meetings need not be given, provided, however, that if the board of directors shall fix or change the time or place of any regular meeting, notice of such action shall be given as set forth herein. Notice of the time and place of special meetings and any required notice of regular meetings shall be delivered personally, sent by first-class mail or sent by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic means, to each director, addressed to him or her at his or her address as it is shown on the records of the corporation.
If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by
 
telephone, telegram, electronic mail or other electronic means, it shall be delivered personally or by telephone, to the telegraph company or by other electronic means at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
A majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 3.9 of these bylaws. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
 
Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director (a) who signs a waiver of notice or a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof, whether before or after the meeting, or (b) who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such directors. All such waivers, consent, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made part of the minutes of the meeting. A waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.
 
A majority of the directors present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.
 
Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given before the adjourned meeting takes place, in the manner specified in Section 3.6 of these bylaws, to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting, provided that all members of the board individually or collectively consent in writing or by electronic transmission to that action. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the board of directors. Such written consent and any counterparts thereof, including any consents by electronic transmission, shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.
 
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the board of directors. This Section 3.12 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services.
 
At all meetings of the board of directors, the Chairman of the board of directors shall, when present, preside as Chairman at all meetings of the stockholders and board of directors. The Chairman may call meetings of the stockholders and board of directors and of the committees of the board of directors whenever he shall deem it necessary. The Chairman shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors.
 
In the absence of, or in the case of a vacancy in the office of, the Chairman of the board of directors, the Vice Chairman of the board of directors shall preside as chairman at meetings of the stockholders and board of directors or, if both the Chairman of the board of directors and Vice Chairman of the board of directors are absent, a chairman selected by the remaining directors shall preside over such meetings. The Vice Chairman shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors.
 
The board of directors may designate one or more committees, each committee consisting of one or more directors. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (a) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by this chapter to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (b) adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw of the corporation.
 
Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of Article III of these bylaws, including Section 3.5 (annual and regular meetings; meetings by telephone), Section 3.6 (special meetings and notice), Section 3.7 (quorum), Section 3.8 (waiver of notice), Section 3.9 (adjournment), Section 3.10 (notice of adjournment), and Section 3.11 (action without meeting), with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the board of directors and its members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the board of directors or by resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the board of directors, and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. The board of directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws.
 
The officers of the corporation shall be a chief executive officer, a president, a secretary, a treasurer, a chief financial officer, a chief operating officer, and a controller. The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 of these bylaws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person.
 
The officers of the corporation, except such officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 or Section 5.5 of these bylaws, shall be chosen by the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment.
 
The board of directors may appoint, or may empower the president to appoint, such other officers as the business of the corporation may require, each of whom shall hold office for such period, have such authority, and perform such duties as are provided in these bylaws or as the board of directors may from time to time determine.
 
Subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board or, except in case of an officer chosen by the board of directors, by any officer upon whom such power of removal may be conferred by the board of directors.
Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
 
A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause shall be filled in the manner prescribed in these bylaws for regular appointments to that office.
 
The chief executive officer shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have general supervision, direction, and control of the affairs and business of the corporation and general supervision of its officers, officials, employees and agents. The chief executive officer shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, in the absence or nonexistence of a chairman of the board, at all meetings of the board of directors. The chief executive officer shall see that all orders and resolutions of the board of directors are carried into effect, and in addition shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
 
Unless the board of directors specifies another officer, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation. If another officer is specified, the president shall have such powers and perform such duties as are prescribed by the chief executive officer or the board of directors, and in the absence or disability of the chief executive officer the president shall have the powers and perform the duties of the chief executive officer except to the extent the board of directors shall have otherwise provided. In addition, the president shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors, the chief executive officer or these bylaws.
 
The chief operating officer shall assist the chief executive officer and the president in the active management of and supervision and direction over the business and affairs of the corporation, subject, however, to the direction of the chief executive officer and the president and the control of the board of directors. In the absence or disability of the chief executive officer and the president, the chief operating officer will assume the powers and responsibilities
 
of the chief executive officer. The chief operating officer shall also have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or these bylaws.
 
The chief financial officer shall have responsibility for the administration of the financial affairs of the corporation and shall exercise supervisory responsibility for the performance of the duties of the treasurer and the controller. The chief financial officer shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
 
The treasurer shall oversee the custody of the corporate funds and securities and shall perform all such other duties as are incident to the office of treasurer. The treasurer may be required to give the corporation a bond for the faithful performance of his or her duties, and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors, the chief financial officer or these bylaws.
 
The controller shall have supervision and charge of the accounts of the corporation. He or she shall be responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and shall perform such other duties as shall be assigned to him or her by the board of directors or the chief financial officer.
 
In the absence or disability of the chief executive officer, the president and the chief operating officer, the vice presidents, if any, in order of their rank as fixed by the board of directors or, if not ranked, a vice president designated by the board of directors, shall perform all the duties of the chief executive officer and when so acting shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions upon, the president. The vice presidents shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed for them respectively by the board of directors, these bylaws, the chief executive officer or the president.
 
The secretary shall keep or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation or such other place as the board of directors may direct, a book of minutes of all meetings and actions of directors, committees of directors and stockholders, and shall keep or cause to be kept, at the principal executive office of the corporation or at the office of the corporation's transfer agent or registrar, a share register, or a duplicate share register, showing the names of all stockholders and their addresses, the number and classes of shares held by each, the number and date of certificates evidencing such shares, and the number and date of cancellation of every certificate surrendered for cancellation. The secretary shall also give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and of the board of directors
 
required to be given by law or by these bylaws. He or she shall keep the seal of the corporation, if one be adopted, in safe custody and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as from time to time may be prescribed by the board of directors or by these bylaws.
 
The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (a) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereunder acquire under any statute, certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
The rights conferred upon persons claiming indemnity in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to a claimant who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the claimant's heirs, executors and administrators. Any
 
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VI that adversely affects any right of a claimant or his or her successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records.
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to beheld, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
 
The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
 
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the applicable resolution or the 60th day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
The shares of a corporation may be represented by certificates or the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock may be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice president, and by the chief financial officer, the treasurer, the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stocks provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each
 
stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on August 31 or such other date as shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors from time to time.
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term person includes both a corporation and a natural person.
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

Potential Goodwill Impairment
Due to the deteriorating macro-economic environment, illiquidity in the credit markets, declines in the stock market and the decline in the price of the Company's common stock, the Company has experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization. As a result the Company has determined that an indicator of potential goodwill impairment is present for its first fiscal quarter. Accordingly, the Company has commenced performing a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step approach as required under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards, No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The Company currently anticipates having such analysis completed in early January. In the event that the Company determines that its goodwill is impaired in whole or part, a non-cash charge, which could be significant and would reduce reported GAAP net income and earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter of 2009, would be required. The maximum goodwill balance that would be subject to such assessment of impairment as of November 30, 2008 is approximately $1.1 billion. The non-cash charge, if any, would not impact the non-GAAP financial information presented in this press release.

Business Update
The Company expects the second fiscal quarter of 2009 net revenue in a range of $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion, with an estimated core operating margin of 2.1 percent. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its second quarter of fiscal 2009 are anticipated to be in a range of $0.12 to $0.16 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $0.04 to $0.08 per diluted share. (GAAP for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 earnings per share are currently estimated to include $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.05 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges.)
"We are taking a conservative position regarding demand for our second quarter," said Jabil President and CEO Tim Main. "Although end markets are weak, the opportunity to expand our market share in targeted areas is very good. We intend to capitalize on the present opportunities to ensure a more robust future when end markets stabilize and the recovery cycle begins," said Main.
Main also reminded investors of Jabil's financial position. "Liquidity and a resilient balance sheet are key advantages in this market environment. The $1.4 billion of liquidity we enjoyed at the end of our first quarter should improve as our working capital and capital expenditure requirements decline during our second quarter." Jabil has nearly $600 million in cash and $800 million available under a five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2012.
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and certain other income/loss) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release are Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On January 22, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce the Company's worldwide workforce by approximately 3,000 employees in order to reduce operating expenses (the "2009 Restructuring Plan"). These restructuring activities are intended to address the current market conditions and properly size the Company's manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of our operations. The 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives. Based on the analysis done to date, the Company currently expects to recognize approximately $65 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The majority of these costs are currently expected to be recorded in the Company's operating results for the fiscal quarter ending February 28, 2009. The Company currently expects that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs will be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. The charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding asset impairment charges, are currently expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $54 million that will be payable over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Upon its completion, the 2009 Restructuring Plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55 million. The majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more amendments to this Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
In connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan described in Item 2.05 above, the Company is performing an impairment assessment on certain long-term assets (including property, plant and equipment and net deferred tax assets) held by each facility impacted by the 2009 Restructuring Plan. Assets that are determined to be impaired will be written down to fair value. At this time, the Company is unable to make a final determination of the estimated range related to the impairment charges. However, to the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more amendments to this Current Report on Form 8-K or include such disclosures in future Forms 10-Q and 10-K as details of the 2009 Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of the related costs and charges are finalized. The impairment charges ultimately recorded are not expected to result in material future cash expenditures.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Potential Goodwill Impairment
Due to further deterioration of the macro-economic environment and the continued decline in the price of the Company's common stock resulting in a sustained market capitalization below the Company's net book value, the Company has determined that an indicator of potential goodwill impairment is present for its second fiscal quarter. Accordingly, the Company has commenced performing a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step approach as required under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards, No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The Company currently anticipates having such analysis completed in early April. In the event that the Company determines that its goodwill is impaired in whole or part, a non-cash charge, which is likely to be significant and would further increase reported GAAP net loss and loss per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2009. The potential impairment charge may also result in significant deferred tax valuation allowance charges. The goodwill balance that would be subject to such assessment of impairment as of February 28, 2009 is approximately $721.3 million and the net deferred tax asset balance that would be subject to impairment as of February 28, 2009 is approximately $184.2 million. The non-cash charge, if any, would not impact the non-GAAP financial information presented in this press release.
Business Update
"Liquidity and balance sheet strength are key advantages in this market environment," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main. "We will continue to focus on controlling our capital, reducing costs and refining our value proposition. When end-markets stabilize and recovery begins, we will be ready with an outstanding, well-funded solution for a growing marketplace," he said. As of the end of its second fiscal quarter of 2009, Jabil has approximately $775 million in cash and $800 million available under a five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2012. Main noted that the Company is aggressively cutting costs and is restructuring its operations to meet the changing demands of its customers.
 
Jabil Earnings Release
March 24, 2009
 
Jabil management said end-markets remain difficult with limited visibility, and as a result, the Company thought it was prudent to take a conservative position regarding third quarter guidance. Jabil said it expects its net revenue for its third fiscal quarter of 2009 to be in a range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, with estimated core operating income in a range from zero to $40.0 million. Jabil said its core earnings per share for its third quarter of fiscal 2009 are anticipated to range from a loss of $0.08 to earnings of $0.08 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range from a loss of $0.23 to a loss of $0.07 per diluted share. (GAAP loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 is currently estimated to include $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles; $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges; and $0.06 per share for restructuring.)

On January 28, 2009, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding the restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 22, 2009 (the "2009 Restructuring Plan"). The 2009 Restructuring Plan was approved to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce the Company's worldwide workforce by approximately 3,000 employees in order to reduce operating expenses. These restructuring activities are intended to address the current market conditions and properly size the Company's manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of its operations. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $65.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs would be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. It was also announced that the charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, were expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $54.0 million that would be payable over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that upon its completion, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55.0 million. The majority of these annual cost savings were expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall 2009 Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a final determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred in the Company's second fiscal quarter of 2009 has been made.
The Company expects to record approximately $32.7 million of the expected $65.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan during its second quarter of fiscal year 2009, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $27.5 million and fixed asset impairment costs of approximately $5.2 million. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $27.5 million include employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $27.4 million and contract termination costs of approximately $0.1 million.
Cash expenditures of approximately $1.3 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were made in the Company's second quarter of fiscal year 2009, including approximately $1.2 million related to employee severance and benefit costs and approximately $0.1 million related to contract termination costs.
The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs and the related cash expenditures, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges and cash expenditures by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. The amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our fiscal quarter, stabilization across our end-markets and our ability to improve profitability and further strengthen our balance sheet as a result thereof, our ability, as a result of the amount of our cash and the amount of availability we have under a five-year revolving credit facility, to grow our business, the anticipated outlook for our business and our currently expected fourth quarter fiscal year 2009 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.

The company also provided a fourth fiscal quarter outlook. "End-markets began to stabilize during the quarter while the company continued to strengthen its balance sheet through strong working capital management," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main.
St. Petersburg, FL  June 23, 2009
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges and certain distressed customer charges.

Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

Third Quarter 2009
Operational and Balance Sheet Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Update
"Although the global economy remains in a recession, we see genuine stabilization across most of our end-markets. A stable end-market environment will provide Jabil an opportunity to improve profitability and further strengthen the balance sheet," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main. Through the nine months ended May 31, 2009, the company produced cash flow from operations of $387 million and reduced total debt and securitization balances by $278 million. With more than $750 million in cash and $800 million available under a five-year revolving credit facility, which expires in 2012, Main said Jabil has a solid foundation on which to grow.
Jabil management indicated that with continued end-market stabilization, it expects its net revenue for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 to be consistent with its third quarter, in a range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. The company estimated that its core operating income would be in a range from $25.0 million to $50.0 million, driven by continued focus on manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions. Jabil also indicated that it expects its core earnings per share for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to range from $0.02 to $0.12 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range from a loss of $0.09 to earnings of $0.01 per diluted share.(GAAP earnings or loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 is currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for amortization of intangibles; $0.06 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges; and $0.01 per share for restructuring.)
Management remains cautious regarding the overall economy and its possible impact on Jabil's performance.
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment

On January 28, 2009, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding the restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 22, 2009 (the "2009 Restructuring Plan"). The 2009 Restructuring Plan was approved to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce the Company's worldwide workforce by approximately 3,000 employees in order to reduce operating expenses. These restructuring activities are intended to address the current market conditions and properly size the Company's manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of its operations. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $65.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs (which, as the Company announced in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that it filed on April 8, 2009, excluded valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets), over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs would be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. It was also announced that the charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, were expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $54.0 million that would be payable over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that upon its completion, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55.0 million. The majority of these annual cost savings was expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with the remainder being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. Subsequently, on March 24, 2009 the Company filed an amendment to the January 28, 2009 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred during the Company's second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall 2009 Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a final determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's third quarter of fiscal year 2009 has been made, as well as the estimated range of the remaining restructuring and impairment costs and the remaining estimated cost ranges and cash expenditures by category type, as noted below. In addition, the Company now expects its worldwide workforce to be reduced by approximately 2, 500 employees due to the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
The Company expects to record approximately $48.8 million of the revised expected total of $64.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan during the nine months ended May 31, 2009, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $42.4 million and fixed asset impairment costs of approximately $6.4 million. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $42.4 million include employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately $42.2 million, contract termination costs of approximately $0.1 million and other restructuring costs of $0.1 million. Of the remaining $15.2 million that the Company expects to record in connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan primarily in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, it expects to incur approximately $8.4 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs, approximately $3.9 million of contract termination costs, approximately $2.5 million of fixed asset impairment costs and approximately $0.4 million of other related restructuring costs.
Cash expenditures of approximately $9.7 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were made during the nine months ended May 31, 2009, including approximately $9.6 million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs and approximately $0.1 million related to contract termination and other costs. The remaining expected cash expenditures related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, of approximately $45.4 million are currently expected to be made primarily during fiscal years 2009 through 2011 in the following amounts: approximately $41.1 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs; approximately $3.9 million of contract termination costs; and approximately $0.4 million of other related restructuring costs.
As part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan, management determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $13.5 million on certain deferred tax assets as a result of the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. The amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
 
To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(b) On July 16, 2009, the board of directors (the "Board") of Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") accepted Laurence S. Grafstein's resignation as a director of the Company that was submitted in connection with Mr. Grafstein's recent change in employment. Mr. Grafstein's resignation will be effective at the end of the Company's current fiscal year, August 31, 2009.
(d) Also on July 16, 2009, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, appointed David M. Stout to serve as a member of the Board, effective September 1, 2009. As of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, Mr. Stout has not yet been named to any of the Board's committees. Because Mr. Grafstein currently serves on the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board's Compensation Committee, his resignation from the Board will create vacancies on these committees. While, as of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Board has not made a decision, it may decide in the future to appoint Mr. Stout to fill one or both of these vacancies.
As a result of his appointment to the Board, Mr. Stout will receive the same cash compensation that non-employee members of the Board receive, which is currently: (i) $58,000 in annual compensation, payable quarterly and (ii) reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board meetings. If Mr. Stout is appointed to one or more of the Board's committees, then he will receive the cash compensation that the Board's non-employee members currently receive for such service. In addition, in October 2009, the Board, along with its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee, will consider whether to grant annual equity-based awards to the non-employee members of the Board (each such non-employee director received a restricted stock award of 16,475 shares in October 2008, 1/8th of which vest every six months) and may establish the cash compensation for the service of non-employee directors on the Board and its committees for the coming fiscal year.
Other than the compensation from the registrant set forth in the preceding paragraph, no arrangement or understanding exists between Mr. Stout and any other persons, pursuant to which Mr. Stout was elected as a director. In addition, no related party transactions involving Mr. Stout that are reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K exist.
 
On July 22, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing the resignation of Mr. Grafstein from, and the appointment of Mr. Stout to, the Board. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing.

These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: such factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL) today announced that its Board of Directors has accepted Laurence S. Grafstein's resignation as a director and has appointed David M. Stout to serve as a member of the Board.
St. Petersburg, FL  July 22, 2009 - -
Grafstein was recently named managing director and co-head of U.S. mergers and acquisitions for the investment banking firm of Rothschild, Inc. Per Jabil's corporate governance guidelines, Grafstein submitted his resignation in connection with his change in employment. "Unfortunately, Larry's new responsibilities, combined with the broadening time requirements of the Jabil board, make it impractical for him to remain on the board. We thank Larry for his significant contributions over the past seven years. He has offered invaluable counsel to the company through his participation on the compensation committee, as well as our nominating and corporate governance committee," said Jabil's Chairman of the Board, William D. Morean. Grafstein has served as a Jabil director since April 2002. Grafstein's resignation is effective at the end of the Jabil's current fiscal year, August 31, 2009.
Upon the recommendation of the Jabil Board of Directors' nominating and corporate governance committee, David M. Stout was appointed to serve as a member of Jabil's board, effective September 1, 2009. Stout has not yet been named to any of the board's committees.
A top-level pharmaceutical executive nationally and internationally for the past 30 years, David M. Stout is currently retired. Stout was most recently president of pharmaceutical operations for GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals. In this capacity, Stout led global commercial activities, global manufacturing and all vaccine-related activities, including research and development. Prior to his tenure at GSK, Stout served in various executive roles at SmithKline Beecham and Schering-Plough Corporation. Stout currently serves on the board of directors for Airgas Incorporated, NanoBio Pharmaceuticals and Allos Therapeutics.

(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review in accordance with the standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100 of the unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2008, February 28, 2009 and May 31, 2009, and the unaudited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, the three- and six-month periods ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008, and the three- and nine-month periods ended May 31, 2009 and 2008, included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended November 30, 2008, February 28, 2009 and May 31, 2009, respectively, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and as at June 30, 2009; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company; and inquiries of certain officials
 
of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to May 31, 2009, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that there was, as of a date no more than three business days prior to the respective dates of such letters (the "Cut-off Date"), (a) any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt or any decrease in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the May 31, 2009 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, or (b) for the period from June 1, 2009, to the Cut-off Date, any decrease, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except (in the case of both (a) and (b)) in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, disclosures have occurred or may occur, and except that certain officials of the Company have advised them that net sales is expected to be lower for the period from June 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009 as compared with the corresponding period in the preceeding year.

(h) The Securities shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company and any other relevant clearing system.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
 
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the information contained in the third paragraph, sixth paragraph (third and fourth sentences only), tenth paragraph (first sentence only) of the "Underwriting" section of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel, if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential
provided
however
 
defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 10, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same
provided
however
 
rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
11. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Fourth Quarter 2009
Operational and Balance Sheet Highlights
Business Update
"Based upon our current expectations, it appears as though the worst of the recession is behind us. However, we remain vigilant and will continue to focus on productivity, quality and balance sheet health even as revenues begin to recover. We are grateful for the dedicated efforts of our global workforce and look forward to a more robust fiscal 2010," said President and CEO Timothy L. Main. Through the twelve months ended August 31, 2009, the company produced cash flow from operations of $556 million and currently has more than $800 million in cash. During the quarter the company repurchased $295 million of its 5.875% senior notes that were due in 2010 (98% of the total outstanding) and closed on its $312 million offering of 7.75% senior notes due 2016. The company also has an $800 million revolving credit facility. "In short, we are ready to take advantage of opportunities for growth in our fiscal 2010," said Main.
Jabil management said it expects to divest of its automotive electronics manufacturing entity located in Western Europe during its first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010. The company indicated it expects a loss of $20 to $25 million on the sale of the entity, of which $4 million is expected to be cash. Subject to country-specific regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the transaction is anticipated to close during the company's first fiscal quarter.
Fiscal First Quarter 2010 Guidance
Jabil management indicated that it expects its net revenue for its first fiscal quarter of 2010 to be in a range from $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion. The company estimated that its core operating income would be in a range from $85 million to $105 million, driven by the continued demand from its customers, further

manufacturing efficiencies and the benefit of cost reductions. Jabil indicated that it expects its core earnings per share for its first quarter of fiscal 2010 to range from $0.24 to $0.32 per diluted share. GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range from $0.02 to earnings of $0.12 per diluted share. (GAAP earnings or loss per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 is currently estimated to include $0.10 to $0.12 per share loss on the aforementioned automotive divestiture; $0.03 per share for amortization of intangibles; $0.05 per share for stock-based compensation and related charges; and $0.02 per share for restructuring.)
Supplemental Information
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, certain other expenses and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release are Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities and Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
     On January 28, 2009, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding the restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 22, 2009 (the "2009 Restructuring Plan"). The 2009 Restructuring Plan was approved to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce the Company's worldwide workforce by approximately 3,000 employees in order to reduce operating expenses. These restructuring activities were intended to address market conditions and properly size the Company's manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of its operations. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $65.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs (which, as the Company announced in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that it filed on April 8, 2009, excluded valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets), over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs would be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. It was also announced that the charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, were expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $54.0 million that would be payable over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that upon its completion, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55.0 million. The majority of these annual cost savings was expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with the remainder being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. On March 24, 2009 and June 23, 2009, the Company filed amendments to the January 28, 2009 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A on each date to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred during the Company's second and third quarters of fiscal year 2009.
     As part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan, management determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities. Therefore, the Company recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 a valuation allowance of $13.5 million on certain deferred tax assets as a result of the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
     Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall 2009 Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a final determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 has been made, as well as the estimated range of the remaining restructuring and impairment costs and the remaining estimated cost ranges and cash expenditures by category type, as noted below. In addition, the Company now expects its worldwide workforce to be reduced by approximately 4,500 employees due to the 2009 Restructuring Plan and for the 2009 Restructuring Plan to result in cash expenditures of approximately $57.4 million.
     The Company expects to record approximately $53.7 million of the revised expected total of $64.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan during the twelve months ended August 31, 2009, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $47.3 million and fixed asset impairment costs of approximately $6.4 million. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $47.3 million include employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately $47.1 million, contract termination costs of approximately $0.1 million and other restructuring costs of $0.1 million. The Company expects to record the remaining $10.3 million in connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan in fiscal year 2010 as follows: approximately $6.4 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs, approximately $3.4 million of contract termination costs, approximately $0.2 million of fixed asset impairment costs and approximately $0.3 million of other related restructuring costs.
     Cash expenditures of approximately $19.2 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were made during the twelve months ended August 31, 2009, including approximately $19.0 million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs and approximately $0.2 million related to contract termination and other costs. The remaining expected cash expenditures related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, of approximately $38.2 million are currently expected to be made primarily during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 in the following amounts: approximately $34.5 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs; approximately $3.4 million of contract termination costs; and approximately $0.3 million of other related restructuring costs.
     This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. The amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
 
     To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities and Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
     On January 28, 2009, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contained disclosure surrounding the restructuring plan that was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 22, 2009 (the "2009 Restructuring Plan"). The 2009 Restructuring Plan was approved to better align the Company's manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce the Company's worldwide workforce by approximately 3,000 employees in order to reduce operating expenses. These restructuring activities were intended to address market conditions and properly size the Company's manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of its operations. At the time of filing, the Company announced that it expected to recognize approximately $65.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and impairment costs (which, as the Company announced in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that it filed on April 8, 2009, excluded valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets), over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that a significant portion of the total restructuring costs would be related to employee benefit and severance arrangements. It was also announced that the charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, were expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $54.0 million that would be payable over the course of the Company's fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and that upon its completion, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55.0 million. The majority of these annual cost savings were expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with the remainder being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. On March 24, 2009, June 23, 2009 and September 29, 2009, the Company filed amendments to the January 28, 2009 8-K by filing a Form 8-K/A on each date to disclose a determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2009, respectively. In addition, the Company disclosed in the Form 8-K/A that it filed on September 29, 2009 that it now expects its worldwide workforce to be reduced by approximately 4,500 employees due to the 2009 Restructuring Plan and for the 2009 Restructuring Plan to result in cash expenditures of approximately $57.4 million.
     As part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan, management determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $13.1 million on certain deferred tax assets as a result of the 2009 Restructuring Plan.
     Although such previously disclosed estimates related to the overall 2009 Restructuring Plan have not materially changed, a final determination of the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2010 has been made, as well as the estimated range of the remaining restructuring and impairment costs and the remaining estimated cost ranges and cash expenditures by category type, as noted below. In addition, based on the Company's most current estimates, it now expects its worldwide workforce to be reduced by approximately 4,000 employees due to the 2009 Restructuring Plan and for the 2009 Restructuring Plan to result in cash expenditures of approximately $57.1 million. The Company expects to record approximately $57.2 million of the revised expected total of $64.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan through November 30, 2009, including both costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $50.3 million and fixed asset impairment costs of approximately $6.9 million. The expected costs associated with exit or disposal activities of approximately $50.3 million include employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately $46.9 million, contract termination costs of approximately $3.3 million and other restructuring costs of $0.1 million. The Company expects to record the remaining $6.8 million in connection with the 2009 Restructuring Plan during the remainder of fiscal year 2010 as follows: approximately $6.3 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs, approximately $0.4 million of contract termination costs and approximately $0.1 million of other related restructuring costs.
     Cash expenditures of approximately $26.5 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were made through November 30, 2009, including approximately $25.8 million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs and approximately $0.7 million related to contract termination and other costs. The remaining expected cash expenditures related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan, excluding fixed asset impairment charges, of approximately $30.6 million are currently expected to be made primarily during the remainder of fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 in the following amounts: approximately $27.4 million of employee severance and termination benefit costs; approximately $3.1 million of contract termination costs; and approximately $0.1 million of other related restructuring costs.
     This information will be subject to timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. The amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The 2009 Restructuring Plan as discussed reflects the Company's intention only and the restructuring decisions at certain foreign plants are still subject to consultation with the Company's employees and their representatives.
     To the extent required by applicable rules, the Company will file one or more additional amendments to the Current Report on Form 8-K as details of the Restructuring Plan are refined and estimates of related costs and charges are finalized.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
(a) On July 28, 2010, following a competitive process undertaken by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") of Jabil Circuit, Inc. ("Jabil"), the Audit Committee approved the selection of Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") to serve as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011. KPMG LLP ("KPMG") was notified on July 28, 2010 that it will not be retained as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011. KPMG's engagement as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm to audit Jabil's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2010, is unaffected by the selection of E&Y, as KPMG's dismissal will become effective upon the completion of KPMG's audit of Jabil's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010 and the filing of the related Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of Jabil and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as follows:
     KPMG's report on the consolidated financial statements of Jabil and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, contained a separate paragraph stating that "As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective September 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, . As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 158, , as of August 31, 2007."
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
     The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2009 and 2008 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except as follows:
     KPMG's report as of August 31, 2008 stated that "Jabil Circuit, Inc. acquired certain manufacturing operations of Nokia Siemens Networks S.p.A. ("NSN") during the year ended August 31, 2008, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2008, NSN's internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of approximately $217.0 million and total revenues of approximately $353.0 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Jabil Circuit, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended August 31, 2008. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Jabil Circuit, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of NSN."
     During the two fiscal years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, and the subsequent interim period through July 28, 2010, there were (i) no disagreements between Jabil and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG would have caused KPMG to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
     Jabil provided KPMG with a copy of this Form 8-K, and requested KPMG to furnish it with a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter, dated August 3, 2010, is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 8-K.
(b) On July 28, 2010, the Audit Committee approved the selection of E&Y to serve as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011, with the finalization of the engagement terms to be completed prior to September 1, 2010. During the two fiscal years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, and the subsequent interim period through July 28, 2010, Jabil has not consulted with E&Y, regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Jabil's consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to Jabil or oral advice was provided that E&Y concluded was an important factor considered by Jabil in
 
reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a "reportable event," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On July 28, 2010, we were notified that Jabil Circuit, Inc. engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its principal accountant for the year ending August 31, 2011 and that the auditor-client relationship with KPMG LLP will cease upon completion of the audit of Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2010, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010, and the issuance of our reports thereon. We have read Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K dated August 3, 2010, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s statement that the change was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s statement that Ernst & Young LLP were not engaged regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
(a) On July 28, 2010, following a competitive process undertaken by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") of Jabil, the Audit Committee approved the selection of Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") to serve as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011. KPMG LLP ("KPMG") was notified on July 28, 2010 that it would not be retained as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011. KPMG's engagement as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm to audit Jabil's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2010, was unaffected by the selection of E&Y, as KPMG's dismissal became effective upon the completion of KPMG's audit of Jabil's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010 and the filing of the related Annual Report on Form 10-K. On October 21, 2010, Jabil filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, indicating that KPMG's term as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm has ended.
     The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of Jabil and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as follows:
     KPMG's report on the consolidated financial statements of Jabil and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009, contained a separate paragraph stating that "As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, effective September 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting and disclosure guidance related to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Also discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, effective September 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on earnings per share which provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, be considered participating securities and therefore included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method."
     The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
     During the two fiscal years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009, and the subsequent interim period through the filing of Jabil's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010 on October 21, 2010, there were (i) no disagreements between Jabil and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG would have caused KPMG to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
     Jabil provided KPMG with a copy of this Form 8-K/A, and requested KPMG to furnish it with a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter, dated October 21, 2010, is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 8-K/A.
(b) On July 28, 2010, the Audit Committee approved the selection of E&Y to serve as Jabil's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011 with the terms of such engagement subsequently approved by the Audit Committee on August 30, 2010. During the two fiscal years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009, and the subsequent interim period through October 21, 2010, Jabil has not consulted with E&Y, regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Jabil's consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to Jabil or oral advice was provided that E&Y concluded was an important factor considered by Jabil in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a "reportable event," as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We were previously principal accountants for Jabil Circuit, Inc. and, under the date of October 21, 2010, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of Jabil Circuit, Inc. as of and for the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010. On July 28, 2010, we were notified that Jabil Circuit, Inc. engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its principal accountant for the year ending August 31, 2011 and that the auditor-client relationship with KPMG LLP will cease upon completion of the audits of Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2010, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010, and the issuance of our reports thereon. On October 21, 2010, we completed our audits and the auditor-client relationship ceased. We have read Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K/A dated October 21, 2010, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s statement that Ernst & Young LLP were not engaged regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Jabil Circuit, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

     (ii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business affairs or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (f) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, the Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to furnish to the Underwriters letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and confirming that they are an independent registered accounting firm within the meaning of the Exchange Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
 
     (i) in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company, to the extent prepared; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to August 31, 2010, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that there was, as of a date no more than three business days prior to the respective dates of such letters (the "Cut-off Date"), (a) any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt or any decrease in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the August 31, 2010 audited condensed consolidated balance sheet included in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, or (b) for the period from September 1, 2010, to the Cut-off Date, any decrease, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except (in the case of both (a) and (b)) in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable, disclosures have occurred or may occur; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 9; or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business affairs or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set
 
forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (h) The Securities shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company and any other relevant clearing system.
     (i) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representative such further information, certificates and documents as the Representative may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 9 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representative. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

          10. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 9 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 13 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representative on demand for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Expenses

Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or
 
any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the information contained in the third paragraph, sixth paragraph (third and fourth sentences only), tenth paragraph (first sentence only) of the "Underwriting" section of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 11 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 11, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of
 
any separate counsel, other than local counsel, if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
provided
however
 
were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 11, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 11 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

          12. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 12, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations

Remaining Scheduled Payments
provided, however
     If (a) the Company shall have on any date (the "") consolidated with or merged into, or conveyed or transferred or leased its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to, any Person which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (b) as result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published tax rulings of such jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or any change in the official administration, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes, which change or amendment becomes effective after the Succession Date or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public on or prior to such Succession Date and is notified to the Company, such continuing Person would be required to pay any Successor Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the Notes in respect of any payments that it may be required to make with respect to any Notes and (c) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company or such continuing Person taking reasonable measures available to it, the Company or such continuing Person may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; , that (a) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which a continuing Person would be obligated to pay such Successor Additional Amounts were a payment then due in respect of the Notes, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Successor Additional Amounts must remain in effect.

     The payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, this Note shall be deemed to include the payment of Successor Additional Amounts provided for in the Indenture or herein to the extent that, in
 
such context, Successor Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Indenture or this Note.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, if on or prior to Maturity there shall have occurred a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless the Company shall have redeemed the Notes prior to such occurrence, the Company shall, at the option of the Holders thereof, purchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes for which a Change of Control Purchase Notice shall have been delivered as provided in the Indenture and not withdrawn by a date which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date that a Repurchase Offer Notice is mailed with respect to the occurrence of such Change of Control, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the Change in Control Purchase Date.

     As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute such proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder, (iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as is reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and (v) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; , , that such limitations do not apply to a proceeding instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of, any premium and (subject to certain provisions of the Indenture) interest on, and, if applicable, the Change of Control Purchase Price or any Additional Amounts with respect to, this Note on the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed herein, or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date or, in the case of repayment at the option of the Holder, on the date such repayment is due, or, in the case of a Change of Control or as to any Change of Control Purchase Notice given timely, on the Change of Control Purchase Date.
provided
however
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the Trustee by entering into an indenture or indentures supplemental thereto with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes.

     Subject to the terms of the Indenture, prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

     On December 7, 2010, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.0 billion, subject to potential increases up to $1.3 billion (the "Facility"). The Agreement was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent; and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Bank of America, N.A., as documentation agents. Some or all of the lenders under the Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, many if not most of the agents and lenders under the Facility held positions as agent and/or lender under the Company's Existing Credit Agreement, as defined below. The revolving credit portion of the Facility terminates on December 7, 2015. Interest and fees on Facility advances are based on the Company's non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0.40% to 1.50% above the base rate or 1.40% to 2.50% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greatest of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and 1.0% above one-month LIBOR, and the Eurocurrency rate represents adjusted LIBOR for the applicable interest period, each as more fully described in the Agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit. Based on the Company's current non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest would be 0.850% above the base rate or 1.850% above the Eurocurrency rate. The Facility includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. As of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, draws in the approximate amount of $300 million in revolving credit advances have been made and are outstanding under the Facility.
     The Agreement amends and restates the Company's five-year credit agreement dated July 19, 2007, as amended (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which established a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $800.0 million, subject to potential increases up to $1.0 billion, and a term loan in the amount of $400.0 million, and was to terminate on July 19, 2012. The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent; and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, N.A., UBS Loan Finance LLC and Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as documentation agents.
     Some or all of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, many if not most of the agents and lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement hold positions as agent and/or lender under the Agreement.
     The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its next fiscal quarter.

     On January 20, 2011, the Board of Directors of Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") approved The Jabil Circuit, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is effective as of January 1, 2011.
     Under the Plan, certain highly compensated employees of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may defer a portion of their base salary and bonus or incentive compensation. Amounts deferred by a participant under the Plan will be credited by book entry to the participant's deferral contribution account. The Plan permits the Company to make discretionary contributions and matching contributions to an account maintained for each Plan participant. The value of a participant's account will be based on the performance of available benchmark investment funds selected by the participant under the Plan for purposes of accounting (as if the deferred compensation had been so invested) and not for actual investment.
     The obligations of the Company under the Plan (the "Obligations") are unsecured general obligations to pay in the future the value of the vested deferred compensation accounts adjusted to reflect the performance of the selected measurement investment funds in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The Obligations will rank without preference with other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company from time to time outstanding and are, therefore, subject to the risks of the Company's insolvency or bankruptcy. The Company is not required to fund or otherwise segregate assets to be used for the payment of the Obligations.
     Obligations are generally payable under the Plan upon (i) termination of employment, (ii) death, (iii) disability, (iv) a determination by the Company that a participant has suffered a financial hardship, and (v) at the prior election of the participant, during April of any year designated by the participant beginning with the fourth calendar year after a participant's initial deferral election with respect to a particular Plan account (provided that if the deferral relates to the participant's fiscal year 2011 bonus compensation, the participant may select the third calendar year following the initial deferral election with respect to that particular Plan account).
     The Compensation Committee may amend the Plan from time to time, except that no such amendment may reduce the vested amount credited to a participant's account, as of the date the amendment is adopted, as such account may be subsequently adjusted for earnings and losses.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our third fiscal quarter; our ability to deliver record revenue and earnings in fiscal 2011; the new business opportunities in targeted segments; and our currently expected fourth fiscal quarter net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our third fiscal quarter that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; adverse changes in the demand, or expected demand, of our customers; the expected new business opportunities in targeted segments failing to arise; adverse changes in current macro-economic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; the ongoing situation in Japan and its effects on our Japanese facility, supply chain, shipping costs, customers and suppliers; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire (including, with respect to the acquisition of the Italian and French sites, potential unknown liabilities and the costs associated with addressing potential reduced business activity at these sites); risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, subsequent Reports on
Form 10-Q
and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
...Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), reported its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, ended May 31, 2011. "Revenue growth was stronger than expected for our third quarter," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil. "We are pleased to demonstrate continued growth above our long-term targets. As a result, Jabil is poised to deliver record revenue and earnings in fiscal 2011."
St. Petersburg, FL  June 21, 2011
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)
Net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $4.2 billion compared to $3.5 billion for the same period of fiscal 2010.

"We are gratified to see the new business opportunities in targeted segments continuing and are pleased with our operating performance, which remains ahead of our long-term goals for the company" said Main.
 
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core return on invested capital, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 27, 2011, Jabil Circuit, Inc. issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended August 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), reported its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2011, ended August 31, 2011, announcing fiscal year revenue growth of 23 percent, operating income growth of 77 percent and earnings growth of 126 percent. "Posting a record quarter and fiscal year in the present environment is remarkable," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil. "Demand for our expertise in managing global supply chain networks remains robust, especially now as customers increasingly focus on growth in developing economies."
St. Petersburg, FL  September 27, 2011
Jabil believes that its strength in managing complex products and process technologies on a global scale has been important to exceeding its long-term growth targets in fiscal 2011. Jabil achieved growth through a combination of market share gains, new customer wins and new production from its existing customer base. Management indicated that their success rate allowed them to grow their Diversified Manufacturing Services business 43 percent in fiscal 2011, well above the long-term growth target of 20 to 30 percent per year. Performance in Enterprise & Infrastructure and High Velocity business areas were also above long-term growth targets, posting revenue growth of 18 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
"In addition to progress against our long-term objectives, we generated significantly higher cash flow in fiscal 2011, enabling the return of $262 million in capital to shareholders via our dividend and share-repurchase program," said Main. Jabil generated $828 million in cash flow from operations over the course of the year. Business expansion combined with a focus on lean manufacturing principles and capital efficiency continue to be areas of emphasis for the company.

Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP.

Business Update
"While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our expectation for continuing growth underscores our belief in the benefit of diversification and the sustained demand for our services," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "Customers are most concerned with driving higher levels of performance from their supply chain networks. We intend to drive superior levels of customer loyalty by giving them peerless performance throughout our organization."
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.08 per share for stock-based compensation).

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 20, 2011, Jabil Circuit, Inc. issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the first fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported preliminary, unaudited financial first quarter of fiscal year 2012 net revenue of $4.3 billion, a six percent increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. "Jabil posted another company record quarter in revenue and earnings per share, driven by strength in Diversified Manufacturing Services and High Velocity segments," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil. "We are especially pleased with our operating margin performance in the quarter as the emphasis on operational efficiency and business diversity delivered positive results in a period of economic uncertainty."
St. Petersburg, FL  December 20, 2011
Revenue from Diversified Manufacturing Services increased 30 percent year over year, climbing to 42 percent of total revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2012. Jabil saw seasonal strength in its High Velocity segment during the first fiscal quarter, although it declined to 30 percent of total revenue, reflecting the company's increased emphasis on shifting the mix of its business. Revenue from Enterprise & Infrastructure increased four percent from the prior year period, which was lower than expected primarily due to inventory adjustments from specific customers unrelated to weakness in end-market demand. The company expects revenue levels in this segment to increase sequentially in the second fiscal quarter of 2012.
Improving business mix and diversification, combined with an emphasis on operational efficiency, enabled Jabil to expand margins and earnings at lower revenue growth rates in a tepid economic environment.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)
 
Sequential First Quarter Fiscal 2012
Operational Highlights
 
 
 
 
Business Update
"Expectations for the second fiscal quarter of 2012 are consistent with seasonal patterns of demand," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "Although the economic environment has a number of uncertainties, we are on track to deliver another record year in fiscal 2012."
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.09 per share for stock-based compensation).
 
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT:
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2012; the expected sequential increase in revenue levels from Enterprise & Infrastructure customers in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012; the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 being consistent with seasonal patterns of demand; the economic environment's uncertainties; the company being on track to deliver another company record year in fiscal year 2012 and our currently expected second quarter of fiscal year 2012 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; adverse changes in the demand, or expected demand, of our customers, particularly our Enterprise & Infrastructure customers; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire (including, with respect to the acquisition of the Italian and French sites, potential unknown liabilities and the costs associated with addressing potential reduced business activity at these sites); risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, subsequent Reports on Form 8-K and our other securities filings.

St. Petersburg, FL  March 20, 2012
"Overall, we are pleased with being able to increase revenue eight percent from our second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2011 and post a solid operating margin," said Main.

Business Update
"Our continued focus and investment in Diversified Manufacturing Services is paying off for Jabil," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main.

Jabil management also provided guidance for its third fiscal quarter of 2012.
 
GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.09 per share for stock-based compensation).

The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.

On March 19, 2012, Jabil Circuit, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five year credit agreement (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.3 billion, which may, subject to lenders' discretion, potentially be increased up to $1.6 billion (the "Facility"). The Agreement was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Bank of America, N.A., as documentation agents. Most of the lenders under the Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, most of the agents and lenders under the Facility held positions as agent and/or lender under the Company's Existing Credit Agreement, as defined below. The Facility terminates on March 19, 2017. Interest and fees on Facility advances are based on the Company's non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0.175% to 0.850% above the base rate or 1.175% to 1.850% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greatest of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and 1.0% above one-month LIBOR, and the Eurocurrency rate represents adjusted LIBOR for the applicable interest period, each as more fully described in the Agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit. Based on the Company's current non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Moody's Investor Service, the current rate of interest would be 0.45% above the base rate or 1.45% above the Eurocurrency rate. The Facility includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. As of the date of filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, draws in the approximate amount of $520.0 million in revolving credit advances have been made and are outstanding under the Facility.
The Agreement amends and restates the Company's amended and restated five year credit agreement dated December 7, 2010 (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which established a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.0 billion, subject to potential increases up to $1.3 billion, and was to terminate on December 7, 2015. The Existing Credit Agreement was entered into among the Company; the initial lenders named therein; Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Bank of America, N.A., as documentation agents.
Most of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement, and their affiliates, have various other relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. The Company and some of its subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, most of the agents and lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement hold positions as agent and/or lender under the Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarter ending February 29, 2012.
 
To the extent that entering into the Agreement constituted a termination of the Existing Credit Agreement, the information included in Item 1.01 of this Report relating to such termination is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
 
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On June 19, 2012, Jabil Circuit, Inc. issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the third fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
. Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), today reported preliminary, unaudited third quarter net revenue of $4.3 billion for fiscal year 2012. "We are pleased to post core EBITDA margins of 6.5 percent in the quarter, our highest level since 2005. Core operating margins also expanded to 4.5 percent," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil. "This is particularly gratifying during a period of more subdued revenue growth for the company overall."
St. Petersburg, FL  June 19, 2012
Revenue from Diversified Manufacturing Services increased to $1.9 billion, a 22 percent year over year increase, and accounted for 44 percent of total revenue in the third fiscal quarter of 2012.
Jabil's High Velocity business represented 25 percent of total revenue and its Enterprise & Infrastructure business accounted for 31 percent of the quarter's revenue.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil calculates core operating margin as core operating income divided by net revenue. Jabil defines its core EBITDA margin as core operating income before depreciation expense divided by net revenue. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core EBITDA margin, core earnings, core earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, its calculation of core operating margin, Jabil's core earnings and core earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital, its calculation of core EBITDA margin and additional information in the supplemental information.)
Operational Highlights Fiscal Q3 2012 versus Fiscal Q3 2011
 
Business Update
"We are delighted with the outstanding performance of our Diversified Manufacturing Services sector overall and we are actively expanding our capacity in order to meet the growing demands of numerous customers and products," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "The ramp-up of new products, combined with specific customer challenges and muted end-markets give us plenty to focus on in the fourth fiscal quarter," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "We believe success in the fourth quarter will set the stage for a brisk fiscal 2013 and a continuation of record setting years."
 
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.09 per share for stock-based compensation).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT:
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our third quarter of fiscal year 2012; the ramping of new products; specific customer challenges; muted end-markets; our focus in the fourth fiscal quarter; our fiscal 2013 performance and our currently expected fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; our inability to ramp the new products in our Materials Technology Group, an unexpected difference in our focus in the fourth fiscal quarter; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire (including, with respect to the acquisition of the Italian and French sites, potential unknown liabilities and the costs associated with addressing potential reduced business activity at these sites); risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core operating margin, core EBITDA margin, core return on invested capital, core earnings and core earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release are Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculation of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.
The following table reconciles (1) "Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax GAAP operating income" to (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income":
 
 
 
 
 
The Company calculates core EBITDA margin as operating income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on the disposal of subsidiaries and depreciation expense divided by net revenue.
The following table reconciles core EBITDA to net income and operating income in accordance with US GAAP:

untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the information contained in the third paragraph. sixth paragraph (third and fourth sentences only) and tenth paragraph (first sentence only) of the "Underwriting; Conflicts of Interest" section of the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or any other written communication.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 11 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 11, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel, if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying
provided
however
 
 
party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 11 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
provided
however
 
 
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 11, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 11 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(e) The Company hereby confirms its engagement of the services of SunTrust as, and SunTrust hereby confirms its agreement with the Company to render services as, a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Conduct Rules of FINRA with respect to the offering and sale of the Securities.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 25, 2012, Jabil Circuit, Inc. issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended August 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished herewith pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Today Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), announced its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, ended August 31, 2012. The company reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion and fiscal year revenue of $17.2 billion. "In this environment, posting another record fiscal year in revenue, income and earnings was quite an achievement," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil.
St. Petersburg, FL  September 25, 2012...
Market share gains, new customer wins and new production from existing customers allowed Jabil to grow its targeted markets during the fiscal year while most of the industry contracted. Jabil's Diversified Manufacturing Services business grew 24 percent in fiscal 2012. Although Jabil picked up share gains in its Enterprise & Infrastructure business during the year, overall demand weakened, resulting in a decrease of 2 percent from fiscal 2011. Jabil's High Velocity business declined 14 percent during the fiscal year.
"Results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by a challenging new program ramp in our Specialized Services sector," said Main. "Additionally demand remained weak in most of our business segments." Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating income for the quarter was $144 million. These results were negatively impacted by a distressed customer charge of $5.9 million. Excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and distressed customer charges, operating income was $175 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39 cents and core diluted earnings per share was $0.54 cents.
"We are pleased to have generated cash flow from operations of $443 million during the quarter and $634 million over the course of the year. Due to this outstanding performance and ongoing strength of the balance sheet, we were able to return $136 million in capital to shareholders during the fiscal year through dividends and share repurchases," said Chief Financial Officer Forbes Alexander. "We see this positive performance continuing and are estimating operating cash flow of $1 billion in fiscal 2013," Alexander noted.
Management also announced that the Jabil Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million worth of shares of the Company's common stock during the next twelve months. The shares will be repurchased from time-to-time in open market or through privately negotiated transactions at the Company's discretion, subject to factors such as market conditions, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for capital expenses and acquisitions and stock price. The repurchased shares should help to minimize the dilution from the Company's employee equity issuance.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)
Operational Highlights Fiscal 2012 versus Fiscal 2011
 
 
Business Update
"We are fortunate to have a healthy balance sheet, strong operations, dedicated employees and a roster of market-leading customers heading into fiscal 2013," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "While the macroeconomic climate remains challenging, our long-term goals and competitive position are intact and we expect earnings to increase between five and ten percent in fiscal 2013." Jabil provided guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2013, which began on September 1
st
.
 
 
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.10 to $0.12 per share for stock-based compensation).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT:
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012; our estimated operating cash flows in fiscal year 2013; potential repurchases of our common stock; our balance sheet, operations, employees and roster of customers heading into fiscal year 2013; the macroeconomic climate; our long-term goals and competitive position; our fiscal year 2013 earnings and our currently expected first quarter of fiscal year 2013 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; fluctuations in our stock's market price; fluctuations in operating results and cash flows; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire (including, with respect to the acquisition of the Italian and French sites, potential unknown liabilities and the costs associated with addressing potential reduced business activity at these sites); risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011, subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K and our other securities filings.

The non-GAAP or core financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges) are a useful measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core operating income, core return on invested capital, core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculation of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.
The following table reconciles (1) "Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax GAAP operating income" to (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income":

St. Petersburg, FL  October 18, 2012Global electronics manufacturing services provider Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL) today announced that its Chairman of the Board, William D. Morean, will not stand for re-election to the Board at the company's annual meeting of shareholders in January 2013. The Board also announced that it anticipates that current President & Chief Executive Officer Timothy L. Main will be appointed Chairman immediately following Morean's departure. Main will remain President & CEO until March 2013 as part of a planned and orderly executive succession.
In addition, the Jabil Board announced that Chief Operating Officer Mark T. Mondello was nominated to stand for election to join the Jabil Board of Directors in January 2013 and will succeed Main as CEO in March 2013.
"On behalf of the Jabil Board, our employees and our shareholders, we thank Bill for his leadership, passion and dedication to Jabil over the past 35 years. We are proud of our progress and our accomplishments, including the fact that since going public in 1993, Jabil is just one of five Fortune 500 companies to post a compounded annual growth rate in revenue and earnings above 25 percent," said Thomas A. Sansone, who served as Jabil's President from 1988 to 1999, and has since served as Vice Chairman of Jabil's Board of Directors.
William E. Morean and James Golden founded the electronics assembly repair business in 1966 in Detroit, Michigan, combining their first names to create the name Jabil. Bill took over the company in 1978. At that time the company had less than $700,000 in annual revenues, no automated equipment and little capital to invest. In 1979 Bill won an award of business with AC-Delco and bet the company on the success of the program. Bill recruited Tom Sansone to join the company in 1983. The two teamed to create a unique culture of empowerment and accountability that is still a vital part of the company's culture today. In the process, they laid the foundation for the company's long-term success.
Today, Jabil is the third largest EMS provider with over $17 billion in revenue and more than 140,000 employees worldwide. Sixty global operations from the Americas, Asia & Europe, design, build and ship approximately $60 million per day of products such as single-use devices for the healthcare industry, wind-turbine engines for the energy market, innovative materials technologies for mobility products and computing products. "Building this business and watching it grow and prosper over the years has truly been an inspirational experience that I will always cherish. And, this Jabil management team has made it easy to have success," said Morean. He continued, "I'm sure my Dad would be
amazed to see the cultural values of accountability and empowerment intact in the global powerhouse that Jabil has become."
"Bill's vision of enabling employees to proactively help our customers design, build and take their products to market quickly and affordably remains firmly embedded in the Jabil culture. One of the great privileges of my life was to take over this leadership role from Bill. I was provided a unique platform from which to lead," current Chief Executive Officer & President Timothy Main said.
"We have maintained an amazing culture, which was initially authored by our current Chairman Bill Morean and Vice Chairman Tom Sansone. Jabil's culture is truly a differentiator and a catalyst to our success," added incoming CEO Mark Mondello.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
.Today Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), announced its preliminary, unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The company reported first quarter revenue of $4.6 billion. "Diversified Manufacturing Services increased to 47 percent of our overall business, paced by outstanding growth in Specialized Services," said Timothy L. Main, President and CEO of Jabil.
St. Petersburg, FL  December 19, 2012
Jabil's Diversified Manufacturing Services business grew 20 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 when compared to results of the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company's Enterprise & Infrastructure business increased 17 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 while Jabil's High Velocity business declined 20 percent during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $170 million. Excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, core operating income was $193 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51 cents and core diluted earnings per share was $0.61 cents.
"We are pleased to have generated cash flow from operations of $152 million during the quarter. As a result of this outstanding performance and the ongoing strength of our balance sheet, we were able to return $148 million in capital to shareholders during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 through dividends and share repurchases," said Chief Financial Officer Forbes Alexander. "We see this positive performance continuing and continue to estimate operating cash flow of $1 billion in fiscal 2013," Alexander noted.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)
Operational Highlights Fiscal Q1 2013 versus Fiscal Q1 2012
 
 
Repurchased $129 million worth of shares and returned $19 million to shareholders via dividends during the quarter.
Business Update
"Expectations for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 are consistent with seasonal patterns of demand," said Jabil CEO Timothy Main. "End market demand remains muted in business sectors exposed to government and business spending. Although environmental conditions continue to be uncertain, we maintain our expectation that fiscal 2013 will be another record year for Jabil."
Fiscal Q2 2013 Guidance Range
 
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.08 per share for stock-based compensation).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT: 
This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2013; our positive performance continuing, specifically our fiscal year 2013 operating cash flow and our strong balance sheet; our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 being consistent with seasonal patterns of demand; end market demand remaining muted in business sectors exposed to government and business spending; our expectation that fiscal year 2013 will be another company record year for Jabil; and our currently expected second quarter of fiscal year 2013 net revenue, core operating income, core and GAAP earnings per share results and the components thereof. The statements in this news release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2013 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; fluctuations in our stock's market price; fluctuations in operating results and cash flows; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; changes in macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; our financial performance during and after the current economic conditions; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; risks and costs inherent in litigation; whether our realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; our ability to take advantage of perceived benefits of offering customers vertically integrated services; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; business and competitive factors generally affecting the electronic manufacturing services industry, our customers and our business; other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified; and other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, subsequent Reports on Form 8-K and our other securities filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Jabil reports core operating income, core return on invested capital, core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculation of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.

In 2004, Muir was promoted to Regional President for Asia and was stationed there for three years.

Exhibit 99.1
Today Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE: JBL), announced preliminary, unaudited financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2013. For the quarter, Jabil reported revenue of $4.4 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent over the second quarter of fiscal 2012. "We are pleased with these results for the quarter, despite the obviously challenging macro environment," said Jabil's Chief Executive Officer, Mark T. Mondello. "During the quarter we made great progress on the Nypro acquisition and believe the market opportunities of our combined capabilities are considerable," said Mondello. "We look forward to a successful completion of this deal in our fourth fiscal quarter."
St. Petersburg, FL  March 20, 2013...
Jabil's three reporting segments delivered the following year over year revenue results:
 
 
 
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $149 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43 cents.
Core operating income results excluding amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation was $170 million and core diluted earnings per share was $0.53 cents. Acquisition-related expenses were $5 million above the company's second quarter forecast. This portion of the expenses was originally forecasted to be incurred during Jabil's third fiscal quarter.
(Definitions used: "GAAP" means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Jabil defines core earnings as GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, goodwill impairment charges, certain distressed customer charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares determined under GAAP. Jabil calculates core return on invested capital by annualizing its after-tax core operating income for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average net invested capital base. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted and basic earnings per share and core return on invested capital to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil's core operating income to its GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share, its calculation of core return on invested capital and additional information in the supplemental information.)
 
(GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 are currently estimated to include $0.02 per share for amortization of intangibles and $0.08 per share for stock-based compensation)

The Company calculates (1) "Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax GAAP operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base" and (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital" by annualizing its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" for its most recently-ended quarter and dividing that by a two quarter average of its "net invested capital asset base."
The Company calculates: (1) its "after-tax GAAP operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its GAAP operating income and (2) its "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income" by subtracting a certain tax effect (the calculation of which is explained below) from its non-GAAP core operating income. See elsewhere in this earnings release for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP core operating income to its GAAP operating income.
The Company calculates "net invested capital asset base" as the sum of the averages (the calculations of which are explained below) of (1) its stockholders' equity, (2) the non-current portion of its notes payable and long term debt and (3) the current portion of its notes payable and long term debt, less the average (the calculation of which is explained below) of its cash and cash equivalents.
The following table reconciles (1) "Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax GAAP operating income" to (2) "Core Return on Invested Capital," as calculated using "after-tax non-GAAP core operating income":
