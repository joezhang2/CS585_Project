FINANCIAL RESULTS
     Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2003 were $143.5 million compared to $142.3 million in the same period of the prior year.

Additionally, our results illustrate that our customers see great value in our access infrastructure solution, helping lower the costs of computing and increase the productive power of the on-demand enterprise."

Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Expertcity, Inc., the market leader in Web-based desktop access as well as a leader in Web-based training and customer assistance products. The transaction is valued at approximately $225 million in cash and stock, with an additional $12 million in stock to be paid to Expertcity stockholders, contingent on achieving certain financial milestones.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. and SANTA BARBARA, Calif.  December 18, 2003 
     The acquisition expands Citrix's portfolio of access products to include Expertcity's popular GoToMyPC software service for secure, browser-based access to desktop PCs from anywhere, over the Web. The acquisition also adds Expertcity's market-leading GoToAssist software service, which provides online help-desk and call-center assistance, as well as training and customer collaboration over the Web. Citrix will leverage Expertcity's e-commerce infrastructure and expertise in online marketing, selling and fulfillment. Citrix said the combined business will help accelerate its growth in the access infrastructure market, which is expected to grow to $8-10 billion in the next four to five years.
     "With over 120,000 customers, Citrix access infrastructure is becoming the corporate standard for on-demand access to enterprise applications and information from anywhere," said
 
Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "This acquisition extends our on-demand access value to include the applications and information that live on individual desktop PCs. Our customers will get scalable, secure and managed access solutions for even greater information security, employee productivity, and enterprise agility."
     Expertcity is a privately held company based in Santa Barbara, Calif. with approximately 200 employees. Its award-winning GoToMyPC products allow users to instantly access home or office PCs remotely from any location. Users need only an Internet connection; no firewall configuration is necessary. GoToMyPC is preconfigured with industry-standard protocols, including advanced encryption standards (AES), dual password requirements and end-to-end user authentication to ensure high levels of security and privacy. GoToMyPC Corporate features advanced management and control options to protect the integrity of enterprise networks including one-time passwords, a two-factor authentication scheme, RSA SecurID integration and comprehensive control for real-time monitoring and reporting. Numerous Fortune 100 companies including Cardinal Healthcare, Cisco Systems, Pfizer, TIAA-CREF and Verizon use GoToMyPC.
     GoToMyPC software service plans are available for customers of various sizes, including individuals, small businesses and enterprises.
     GoToAssist is a Web-based software service that enables a broad range of solutions, including remote technical support for helpdesks and call centers, corporate training, product demonstrations and customer collaboration. It enables highly secure, permission-based sharing of desktop PC screens and rapidly integrates into any existing infrastructure. Many prominent corporations including Best Software, Cablevision, Intuit, Microsoft Business Solutions and Siemens are GoToAssist customers.
     "Today, Citrix products are used by nearly 50 million end users in the enterprise, and with this acquisition, Citrix gains an efficient way to reach individuals, professionals and SOHO customers through Web-based selling and fulfillment," Templeton added. "Most people think of Citrix as being exclusively focused on the server. The fact is, customers need access to information, regardless of where it lives. We are excited about offering customers the most complete and secure solution available for accessing enterprise applications and desktop resources from one vendor."
     "Citrix and Expertcity share the same goal of making the work environment more flexible and efficient by providing easy, secure and instant access to applications and information," said Andreas von Blottnitz, president and chief executive of Expertcity. "Our complementary offerings, coupled with the similarities in our cultures, allow for synergies and
 
accelerated growth. By working together, we will deliver more choice and flexibility to our customers and partners, and increase adoption of Citrix access infrastructure."
Terms of the Deal
     Under terms of the definitive agreement, Citrix will acquire Expertcity for approximately $225 million, payable in approximately 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock. A $12 million earnout will be paid to all Expertcity stockholders if certain financial targets are achieved in 2004. The transaction is expected to be $0.03 to $0.04 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share in the first half of fiscal year 2004, and neutral to earnings in the second half of 2004. The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company and is subject to regulatory review and approvals, including under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, approval by stockholders of Expertcity, and other customary conditions and approvals. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2004 or early in the second quarter of 2004. When completed, Citrix plans to take an expense charge for the value of Expertcity's in-process research and development costs.
     The acquisition is intended to be tax free to stockholders of Expertcity with respect to the stock consideration the stockholders will receive. Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to Citrix, and Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial advisor to Expertcity.
     Expertcity will continue to operate in Santa Barbara, Calif., led by Andreas von Blottnitz, Expertcity's current president and chief executive officer.

      Correction...by Citrix Systems, Inc.
First paragraph, third sentence under the heading "Terms of the Deal" should read : The transaction is expected to be $0.03 to $0.04 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share in the first half of fiscal year 2004, as adjusted to exclude the effect of a one-time expense charge for the value of Expertcity's in-process research and development (which will result in an additional $.05-$.10 dilution to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis), and neutral to earnings in the second half of 2004. The section under the heading "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures" has been added to this release.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of December 18, 2003 by and among Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), EAC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), Expertcity.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), Edward G. Sim as stockholder representative (the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE"), and Andreas von Blottnitz as the initial Contingent Consideration Representative. RECITALS A Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "MERGER") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and to the extent applicable the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), with the Company to be the surviving corporation of the Merger. Following the Merger, Parent will merge (the "LLC MERGER") the Surviving Corporation with and into a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by Parent (the "LLC"), with the LLC to be the surviving entity of the LLC Merger. B The Merger and the LLC Merger are intended to be part of an integrated plan and together are intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code. C The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) determined to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and approve the Merger. D The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. E Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the Persons listed on SCHEDULE 1 hereto is entering into a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION." 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place as promptly as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP, 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Closing would otherwise occur during the Earnings Period, the Closing shall be deferred until the first Business Day following the Earnings Period. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER"), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing being referred to herein as the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). 1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Expertcity.com, Inc."

The director(s) of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial director(s) of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 1.6 MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. (a) MERGER CONSIDERATION. The aggregate consideration (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger to holders of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall be (x) $225 million plus the Option Proceeds less the Acquisition Expenses and less the Medicare Amount (the "INITIAL MERGER CONSIDERATION") plus (y) the Contingent Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be payable in cash and in shares of common stock of Parent, par value $.001 per share (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK"), as set forth in this Section 1.6. (b) EFFECT ON COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock (the "STOCKHOLDERS"), each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.8 hereof, the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration and the Per Share Contingent Consideration, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation this Section 1.6 and the escrow provisions set forth in Article IX hereof. The Per Share Initial Merger Consideration shall be payable in a combination of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, with (i) the cash portion (the "CASH CONSIDERATION") being an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration by (y) the Applicable Fraction and (ii) the stock portion (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION") being a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Per Share Initial Merger Consideration less the Cash Consideration by (y) the Parent Average Closing Price. The Per Share Contingent Consideration shall be payable in shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Parent Average Closing Price as set forth in Section 1.6(f). (c) COMPANY STANDARD OPTIONS.

(d) REDESIGNATION. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.6, if Parent and the Stockholder Representative reasonably conclude that the aggregate fair market value as of the Closing Date of the Parent Common Stock issuable at the Effective Time (I.E., excluding the Contingent Consideration) to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.6 (the "CONTINUITY SHARES") is less than 45% of the sum of (A) the aggregate fair market value as of the Closing Date of the Continuity Shares and (B) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.6, including the Escrow Amount otherwise payable to the Stockholders, plus any other amounts described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) to the extent a proprietary interest in the Company would not be treated as preserved for purposes of applying Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e) to the Merger as a result of the receipt of such amounts (including without limitation amounts payable with respect to Dissenting Shares) (the sum of (A) and (B) is referred to as the "TOTAL CONTINUITY MERGER CONSIDERATION"), then the Applicable Fraction shall be adjusted downward such that, after such adjustment, the Continuity Shares have an aggregate fair market value as of the Closing Date equal to 45% of the Total Continuity Merger Consideration; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Applicable Fraction with respect to any share of Company Capital Stock that was acquired pursuant to the exercise, during the period from the date of this Agreement through and including the Closing, of a Nonstatutory Option be reduced. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be responsible for all computations contemplated by this Section 1.6(d) and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the Stockholders. For the purposes of the redesignation calculations set forth in this Section 1.6(d), (i) all Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be receiving only Cash Consideration, and (ii) appropriate adjustments shall be made to the extent Parent and the Stockholder Representative determine that shares of Company Capital Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of Standard Options should not be counted as outstanding for purposes of this Section 1.6(d). (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof, each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such Stockholder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price. (f) CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. (i) The Contingent Consideration shall be calculated in accordance with SCHEDULE 1.6(F). (ii) The right to receive the Contingent Consideration, if any, payable pursuant to this Agreement is a contract right only and no certificate evidencing such right shall be issued. The right to receive the Contingent Consideration pursuant to the Merger shall not be transferred or assigned, other than to Affiliates. (iii) If at the end of any fiscal quarter during 2004, Surviving Business Revenue for such fiscal quarter (A) is not less than eighty percent (80%) of the forecast for that fiscal quarter as detailed in the -4-
Company's Business Plan provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "BUSINESS Plan") and Surviving Business Gross Margin for such fiscal quarter is not less than eighty-five percent (85%), then during 2004 Parent shall not cause fundamental business changes materially adversely affecting the Surviving Business' ability to meet the Business Plan without the express consent of the Contingent Consideration Representative (as defined below); and (B) is less than the forecast for that fiscal quarter as detailed in the Business Plan, then Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative shall discuss in good faith possible changes to the Business Plan. (iv) The Contingent Consideration, if any, shall be payable as follows: (A) Parent shall pay the Contingent Consideration, if any, on a date that shall be no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the final financial statements of the Surviving Business for the calendar year ending December 31, 2004 are released by the Surviving Business Auditors, and further provided that such date may be extended pursuant to Section 1.6(f)(v)(B) (the "CONTINGENT CLOSING DATE"). Promptly after the Contingent Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, issuable as Contingent Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.6 for payment to the Stockholders in accordance with this Section 1.6. Such number of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be determined by dividing the Contingent Consideration determined pursuant to SCHEDULE 1.6(F) by the Parent Average Closing Price. (B) Only those Stockholders who have properly transmitted their Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent along with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal as set forth in Section 1.8 shall be entitled to receive the Contingent Consideration, if any, payable pursuant to this Agreement. (v) (A) As soon as practicable following the end of the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004, Parent shall cause the Surviving Business Auditors to review the financial statements for the Surviving Business for the year ending December 31, 2004, which statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and consistent with the accounting principles and practices on the basis of which Parent's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 are prepared. Parent shall use such financial statements to promptly prepare a written calculation of the Contingent Consideration, if any, payable in respect of such period and shall deliver a copy of such calculation with reasonable back-up data and a statement showing the method of computing the Contingent Consideration (if any) together with the audited financial statements of the Surviving Business to the President of the Surviving Business (the "CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION REPRESENTATIVE"), within thirty (30) days after such financial statements are released by the Surviving Business Auditors. In performing it duties under this Section 1.6(f), the Contingent Consideration Representative shall keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed and consider in good faith advice given by the Stockholder Representative. -5-
(B) If the Contingent Consideration Representative disagrees with Parent's calculation of Contingent Consideration, the Contingent Consideration Representative may, within ten (10) days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section 1.6(f)(v)(A), deliver a notice to Parent disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth the Contingent Consideration Representative's calculation of the Contingent Consideration. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the Contingent Consideration Representative disagrees. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Contingent Closing Date specified in Section 1.6(f)(iv)(A) shall be extended as required until Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative agree in writing to the calculation of Contingent Consideration. (C) If the Contingent Consideration Representative shall have delivered a notice of disagreement within the ten (10) day period referred to in Section 1.6(f)(v)(B), the Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Contingent Consideration. If the Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement concerning the Contingent Consideration during that period, they shall promptly thereafter cause KPMG, LLP (the "ACCOUNTING REFEREE") promptly to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Contingent Consideration. In making such calculations, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in Parent's calculations of the Contingent Consideration as to which the Contingent Consideration Representative has disagreed in writing. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Contingent Consideration Representative and Parent as promptly as practicable a report setting forth the Accounting Referee's calculation of the disputed amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Contingent Consideration Representative, Parent, the Surviving Business, the Stockholders, and all other parties to this Agreement. The Parent and the Stockholders shall each pay their own fees and expenses and one-half of the costs and charges of the Accounting Referee's review and report. The Stockholders' share of the costs will first be deducted from the Contingent Consideration and then from the Escrow Amount, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.5(b). (vi) In the event that during fiscal year 2004, (i) any two of the following employees of the Company are terminated for reasons other than "Cause" or terminate their employment for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in their respective employment agreements with Parent): Andreas von Blotnitz, John Greathouse and Brian Donahoo, (ii) Parent shall sell or otherwise transfer for value all or substantially all of either the Company's stock or assets or Parent's assets, (iii) Parent shall merge or consolidate with another corporation and in connection therewith the holders of common stock of Parent shall receive, in exchange for their shares, cash or stock or other securities of another corporation, (iv) a tender offer shall be consummated resulting in a person, entity or group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act) beneficially owning (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of Parent, or (v) the Company or the business of the Company shall be acquired substantially in its entirety as a going concern, then in each such event, Parent shall pay the maximum Contingent Consideration ($12,000,000) to the Stockholders concurrently with the consummation of any such event. -6-
(vii) In the event that the Closing does not occur on or prior to March 10, 2004, then Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative shall in good faith discuss whether the terms of SCHEDULE 1.6(F) should be modified to reflect the delay in the Closing; and, if so determined by Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative, then Parent and the Contingent Consideration Representative shall mutually agree on the terms of any such modification. (g) TAX WITHHOLDING. Parent and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or the Company determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment, or the exercise of Standard Options, under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment exceeds the cash portion of the consideration, if any, otherwise payable to such Person, Parent and the Company are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such portion of consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in order to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement. (h) ESCROW. At Closing, Parent, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall deposit with the Escrow Agent $33,750,000 in cash (the "ESCROW AMOUNT"). Each Stockholder shall be deemed to have contributed his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to provide a source of funding to the Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Article IX. "PRO RATA PORTION" of the Escrow Amount shall mean, with respect to each Stockholder, that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the consideration to be received by such Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and the denominator of which is the value of the consideration to be received by all Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(b). For purposes of calculating the value of the consideration to be received pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the value of each share of Parent Common Stock shall be the Parent Average Closing Price. (i) CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED AND COMPANY-OWNED STOCK. Each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration therefor. (j) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. -7-
1.7 DISSENTING SHARES. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Stockholder who either has demanded and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable, and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights, or who, as of the Effective Time, retains the right to demand and perfect dissenters' rights under the CGCL (collectively, "DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time shall effectively withdraw or lose (through passage of time, failure to demand or perfect, or otherwise) the right to demand and perfect appraisal or dissenters' rights under the DGCL and the CGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares that were Dissenting Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to Section 1.6 (including Section 1.6(h)), without interest thereon upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares. (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, demands for purchase by the Company of any shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL, as applicable, on the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or demands for purchase under the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock, demands for purchase of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any other costs or expenses (including specifically, but without limitation, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (other than payments for such shares) (together "DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"), Parent shall be indemnified under the terms of Article IX for the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments. -8-
1.8 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate EquiServe, Inc. and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (collectively, "EQUISERVE") or, if not EquiServe, then a United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger. (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. At the later of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the completion of the redesignation calculations pursuant to Section 1.6(d), but in no event more than two (2) Business Days following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (A) a letter of transmittal (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") which shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration. The Letter of Transmittal shall indicate that applicable withholding Taxes with respect to the exercise of Nonstatutory Options will be withheld from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable to each Stockholder that acquired shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Nonstatutory Option. Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with surrender of a Certificate (or Certificates) for cancellation, the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (less the cash proceeds to be deposited with the Escrow Agent on such holder's behalf) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6(e), and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration provided for in this Article I. (c) PARENT TO PROVIDE PARENT COMMON STOCK AND CASH. Promptly after the Effective Time and the completion of the redesignation calculations pursuant to Section 1.6(d), Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.8 the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 as Initial Merger Consideration in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, on behalf of the Stockholders, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.6(h) and Article IX. (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the -9-
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange therefor until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock for cash. (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or will have established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (f) NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 1.9 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 1.10 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out -10-
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation (or the LLC, after the LLC Merger) with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action. 1.12 LLC MERGER. Within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, Parent will consummate the LLC Merger. ARTICLE II REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the disclosure letter dated as of the date hereof and delivered herewith to Parent (the "COMPANY SCHEDULES") (each of which exceptions disclosed in one section of the Company Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in each other section provided it is reasonably apparent on its face that the matter is responsive to the representation to which such other section relates), the Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 2.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY.

The Company has delivered a true and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended to date and in full force and effect on the date hereof, to Parent. SCHEDULE 2.1 lists every state or foreign jurisdiction in which the Company has facilities, maintains an office or has an employee. 2.2 SUBSIDIARIES.

The Company has no Subsidiaries. 2.3 COMPANY CAPITAL STRUCTURE. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: 31,552,548 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), of which 6,889,131 shares are issued and outstanding; and 8,223,726 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "PREFERRED -11-

2.7 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS. (a) SCHEDULE 2.7 sets forth (i) the audited balance sheet and the related audited statements of operations and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, and (ii) the unaudited balance sheet of the Company (the "COMPANY BALANCE SHEET") as of September 30, 2003 (the "BALANCE SHEET DATE") and the related unaudited statements of operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the nine month period then ended (the financial statements referred to in items (i) and (ii), collectively, the "COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Company Financial Statements are accurate in all material respects and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles effective in the United States ("GAAP") applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each other, except for the absence of footnotes in the case of the unaudited Company Financial Statements. The Company Financial Statements fairly presented, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and during the periods indicated therein, subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments, which were not material in amount or significance. (b) The Company has in place effective "internal control over financial reporting" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Since January 1, 2001, neither the Company nor, to the Company's knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their internal controls over financial reporting, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. During the periods covered by the Company Financial Statements, (i) there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting; and (ii) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting have been reported to the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's external auditors, and any such reports are identified in SCHEDULE 2.7.

(c) To the Company's knowledge, no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of any applicable statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part of their respective operations. To the Company's knowledge, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary -15-
has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of such employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a). (d) During the periods covered by the Company Financial Statements, the Company's external auditor was independent of the Company and its management. For purposes of this Section 2.7(d), "independent of the Company and its management" shall mean that the Company and its external auditor complied at all times with the auditor independence requirements of Title II of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission and any regulatory body claiming jurisdiction over the accounting profession as if the Company were an issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to the Exchange Act during the periods covered by the Company Financials.

All of the Real Property is leased or subleased by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has an interest in such Real Property pursuant to a warehousing, license or occupancy agreement ("LEASED REAL PROPERTY"). (ii) SCHEDULE 2.12(A)(II) sets forth all leases, subleases and other agreements pursuant to which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries derives its rights in the Leased Real Property (the "LEASES"), including, with respect to each such Lease, the identity of the landlord or sublandlord, the date of such Lease and each amendment thereto, the aggregate annual rent, and the address of all buildings. (iii) The Leases are in good standing and are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and there does not exist under any such Lease any default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company's knowledge, by any other Person, or any event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company's knowledge, by any other Person. The Company has delivered to Parent complete copies of all Leases, including all amendments and agreements related thereto, and the Leases constitute the entire agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each landlord or sublandlord with respect to the Leased Real Property. All rent and other charges currently due and payable under the Leases have been paid. (iv) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the holder of the tenant's interest under the Leases and has not assigned the Leases nor subleased all or any portion of the premises leased thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any material alterations, additions or improvements to the premises leased under the Leases that are required to be removed (or of which any landlord or sublandlord could require removal) at the termination of the respective Lease terms. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns all trade fixtures, equipment and personal property located in the premises leased under the Leases and the landlords thereunder have no Lien thereon or claim thereto.

and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except as reflected in the Company Financial Statements or in SCHEDULE 2.12(B) and except for liens for ad valorem Taxes not yet due and payable and such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which are not material in character, amount or extent, and which do not materially detract from the value, or materially interfere with the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected thereby. (c) All facilities, machinery, equipment, fixtures, vehicles, and other personal properties owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are (i) adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted and (ii) in good operating condition, subject to normal wear and tear, and reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for which they are being used, except where a failure to be in such condition would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has sold, transferred, disclosed, made available to the public or otherwise released for distribution any of its customer files and other customer information relating to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries current and former customers (the "COMPANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION"). Except for information as provided to sales representatives (which information is subject to a customary non-disclosure agreement), no Person other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries possesses or has any claims or rights with respect to use of the Company Customer Information.

If any credit card payment services agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently is a party were terminated, the Company knows of no reason why the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be unable to enter into alternative credit card payment services arrangements at least as favorable to the Company as any of its current credit card payment services arrangements. To the Company's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is listed on a "global watch list" in connection with credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval requests. The Company's business as now being conducted and as now proposed to be conducted is not reasonably expected to produce excessive credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval requests (as defined under any agreement, terms, policies or conditions of any vendor of online or offline credit card payment services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or to place the Company on any "global watch list" in connection with credit card charge-backs and/or retrieval requests. 2.13 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. SCHEDULE 2.13 lists each material consent, license, permit, grant or other authorization issued to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity (i) pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently operates or holds any interest in any of its properties or (ii) which is required for the operation of its business as currently conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted or the holding of any such interest (herein collectively called "COMPANY AUTHORIZATIONS"). The Company Authorizations are in full force and effect and -21-
constitute all Company Authorizations required to permit the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to operate or conduct its business as currently conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted or to hold any interest in its properties or assets. 2.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) SCHEDULE 2.14(A) lists: (i) all Company Registered Intellectual Property; (ii) all hardware products and tools, software and firmware products and tools and services that are currently sold, published, offered, or under development by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries; and (iii) all licenses (in and out), sublicenses and other agreements to which the Company and any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person is authorized to use any of the Company Intellectual Property or exercise any rights with respect thereto, other than in-bound "shrink-wrap" end-user licenses and similar generally available commercial binary code end-user licenses in each case that are not used for software development or in any software, products or services provided by the Company to customers. (b) Each item of Company Intellectual Property is either: (i) owned solely by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens; or (ii) rightfully used and authorized for use by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and their permitted successors pursuant to a valid and enforceable written license or other written grant of a right by a third party to use its proprietary information. Other than in-bound "shrink-wrap" end-user licenses and similar generally available commercial binary code end-user licenses in each case that are not used for software development or in any software, products or services provided by the Company to customers, all of the Company Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a license or other grant of a right by a third party to use its proprietary information is separately identified as such in SCHEDULE 2.14(B). The Company and its Subsidiaries have all rights in the Company Intellectual Property necessary to carry out the Company's and the Subsidiaries' former and current activities and to produce, market, sell and license all products and services currently under development, including without limitation (except as noted in SCHEDULE 2.14(B)) rights to make, use, exclude others from using, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, translate, distribute (directly and indirectly), transmit, display and perform publicly, license, rent, lease, assign and sell the Company Intellectual Property in all geographic locations and fields of use, and to sublicense any or all such rights to third parties, including the right to grant further sublicenses. (c) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(C), the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and have not breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice that they have breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any license, sublicense or other agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound relating to any of the Company Intellectual Property, nor does the Company have knowledge of any event or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to constitute such a breach, violation or default (with or without the lapse of time, giving of notice or both). Each such agreement is in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default -22-
thereunder, nor to the knowledge of the Company is any party obligated to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any such agreement in default thereunder. Following the Closing Date, except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(C), the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to exercise all of the Company's rights under such contracts, licenses and agreements to the same extent the Company and each Subsidiary would have been able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than fees, royalties or payments which the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have been required to pay had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.14(C), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is obligated to provide any consideration (whether financial or otherwise) to any third party, nor is any third party otherwise entitled to any consideration, with respect to any exercise of rights by the Company or any Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, as successor to the Company or any Subsidiary, in the Company Intellectual Property. (d) The use of the Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently used and as currently proposed to be used in products and services currently under development does not infringe any other Person's copyright, trade secret rights, right of privacy, right in personal data, moral right, patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, firm name, logo, trade dress, mask work or other intellectual property right, or give rise to any claim of unfair competition, including without limitation any rights of the University of California.

The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such negotiations, discussions or agreements (other than with Parent) that are the subject matter of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, at any time prior to the time the Merger has been approved by the Stockholders, may, in response to a bona fide written Proposal from a third party that was not solicited by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, advisors, representatives or Affiliates and that involves the acquisition by the third party of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (an "ACQUISITION Proposal"): provide information concerning the Company to, and engage in negotiations and discussions with, the third party proposing or offering the Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the third party so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent for informational purposes) the terms of which are (without regard to the terms of the Acquisition Proposal) (x) no less favorable to the Company and (y) no less restrictive on the third party requesting such information than those contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement. In the event that (w) the Acquisition Proposal does not contain a financing contingency, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, (y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the Acquisition Proposal would, taking into account all relevant material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, if consummated, result in a transaction that (1) involves the acquisition by the third party of all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (2) is superior, from a financial point of view, to the -47-
Stockholders than the Merger and (3) is more favorable generally to the Stockholders than the Merger (any Acquisition Proposal as to which such determinations have been made being referred to in this Agreement as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and (z) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject to the conditions of Section 10.1(g) hereof. (c) Nothing in this Section 6.15 shall permit the Company to enter into any agreement, orally or in writing, with respect to a Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement as described above). After the date hereof and before the Effective Time, neither the Company's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation to the Stockholders that they approve this Agreement and the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the time this Agreement and the Merger has been approved by the Stockholders, the Company's Board of Directors, as a result of a Superior Proposal, may withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to the Stockholders that they approve this Agreement and the Merger if and only to the extent that the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company shall advise Parent in writing of any Proposal (including the terms thereof and the identity of the Person making the Proposal) and inquiries with respect to any Proposal within 24 hours of the receipt of such Proposal or inquiry and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status of any discussions regarding a Proposal. Nothing herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act. (d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 6.15 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.15 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, employee, stockholder, agent, advisor, representative, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 6.16 RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The Company shall obtain the resignations of the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, effective as of the Effective Time. 6.17 HSR ACT. To the extent applicable, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to file within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause -48-
any applicable Stockholder of the Company to file within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), Notification and Report Forms (as defined in the HSR Act) relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any applicable stockholder of the Company) to promptly (a) supply the others with any information which reasonably may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's affiliates of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or its affiliates or of the Company or its affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, property and stock. 6.18 INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity) determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), to the fullest extent that the Company would have been required or permitted under its Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof (the "COMPANY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time which are asserted after the Effective Time. In connection therewith, Parent shall also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under the Company Indemnification Obligations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. However, the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.18 shall not apply to: (i) any claim for indemnification made pursuant to Article IX hereof, (ii) any matter that, were it asserted by a third party against Parent or the Surviving Corporation, would be an indemnifiable claim pursuant to Article IX hereof, (iii) any claim or matter that relates to a willful or intentional breach of a representation, warranty or covenant made by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or made by a Stockholder in connection with the Voting Agreement, or (iv) any claim made by Bertelsmann A.G. or any of its Affiliates against any Person. (b) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.18 upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or -49-
investigation, (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, provided that Parent or Surviving Corporation does promptly assume and defend such claim, Parent shall not be liable to such Company Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the Company Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Company Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Company Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. (c) Parent will not, nor will Parent permit the Surviving Corporation to, merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell all or substantially all of the Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's assets unless Parent or the Surviving Corporation will ensure that the surviving or resulting entity assumes the obligations imposed by this Section 6.18. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.18 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and estates.

As an integral term of the Merger, each Stockholder, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the LLC and each of their officers, directors, employees, members, agents and Affiliates (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, interest and penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and expenses of investigation and defense (hereinafter individually a "LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES"; provided that "LOSSES" shall not include any amounts actually received by the Company in respect of insurance) incurred or suffered by any such Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to or in connection with (i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, (ii) any failure by the Company to fully perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant set forth herein or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, (iv) any expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with -58-
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are not specifically set forth on the Expense Certificate or which exceed the amount of expenses specifically set forth on the Expense Certificate, or (v) any Stockholder claims relating to or arising out of the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for claims arising out of or related to disputing a claim to indemnification made by an Indemnified Party hereunder. The Escrow Amount shall be available to reimburse the Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.2. 9.3 LIMITATIONS. The sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for money damages with respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be to make claims against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. No claims shall be made by any Indemnified Party against the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 9.2(i) hereof unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2(i) exceed $300,000 (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT"), at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses (including all Losses included within the Threshold Amount). Parent, Merger Sub, the LLC and the Indemnified Parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matters relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit (i) any right or remedy for fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or misconduct or (ii) any equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance. 9.4 PROCEDURES. (a) Promptly after the discovery of any Loss or Losses by any Indemnified Party, but excluding any claim by a third party described in Section 9.4(c) hereof, which might give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a certificate (the "CLAIM CERTIFICATE"), which Claim Certificate shall: (i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses, or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses, for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and (ii) specify in reasonable detail, to the extent available, each individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty -59-
or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder. (b) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object to the indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim Certificate, the Stockholder Representative shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of such Claim Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a written notice to such effect and the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party shall, within the thirty-day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Stockholder Representative shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative shall succeed in reaching agreement with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to pursue its available remedies for resolving its claim for indemnification. (c) Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim against any Indemnified Party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") that, in the good faith judgment of such Indemnified Party, may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified Party of Losses for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written notice describing in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholder Representative shall relieve the Stockholders of any liability or obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Stockholders have been prejudiced thereby, and then only to such extent. The Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any such Third Party Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Stockholders shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any such Third Party Claim effected without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld. If any such action or claim is settled with the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount of any Loss relating thereto. (d) Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which the Stockholder Representative did not object in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 9.4(b), and claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of resolution by arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "AGREED CLAIMS." The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed Claims within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any such Agreed Claims. -60-

Sim (together with his permitted successors, the "Stockholder Representative"), as his, her or its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to enter into any agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any transactions contemplated by the Escrow Agreement, and to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf of itself of any other Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such stockholders individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Parent of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party, including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) object to such claims pursuant to Section 9.4; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims; (v) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party, against any such stockholder or by any such stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (vi) amend this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement referred to herein or contemplated hereby; and (vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The person serving as the Stockholder Representative may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the cash then on deposit in the Escrow Fund upon not less than ten days' prior written notice to Parent and with Parent's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders. (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or -61-
administration of his duties hereunder. The Stockholder Representative shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties (including without limitation the reasonable fees of counsel), and such fees shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement provided that the sum of the amount of such reimbursement and the amount of any costs deducted from the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 1.6(f)(v)(C) hereof shall be limited to $100,000 in the aggregate; provided, however, that such $100,000 limit shall in no way limit the Stockholder Representative's right to indemnification under this Section 9.5(b). (c) The Stockholder Representative shall have access to relevant information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Company's officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially). (d) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Stockholder; and each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Stockholder. Except for their gross negligence and willful misconduct, each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. (e) Except for matters that are subject to Section 9.4, and without limiting the generality or effect of Section 9.5(a) any and all claims and disputes between or among any Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative and/or any one or more Stockholders relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall in the case of any claim or dispute asserted by or against or involving any such Stockholder (other than any claim against or dispute with the Stockholder Representative), be asserted or otherwise addressed solely by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of such Stockholder (and not by such stockholder acting on its own behalf). 9.6 NO SUBROGATION. Following the Closing, no Stockholder shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any indemnification made by or on behalf of any Stockholder under Section 9.2 if the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. -62-

the part of Parent or Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied; (g) by the Company if (A) the Company is not in breach of Section 4.4 or 6.15 hereof, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to enter into such an agreement attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice, (C) Parent does not make, within five Business Days of receipt of the Company's written notification of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, is at least as favorable to the Stockholders as the Superior Proposal (taking into account all financial and strategic considerations and other relevant factors), (D) concurrent with such termination the Company pays to Parent in immediately available funds the fees and expenses required to be paid pursuant to Section 10.2(b) and (E) concurrently with such termination the Company enters into a binding written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

The Stockholder agrees that process may be served upon him, her or it in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process. 16.

By way of illustration only, and not limitation, Confidential Business Information may include information regarding (a) marketing strategies, programs, plans and methods; (b) pricing policies, product strategies, and methods of operation and other business methods; (c) customer lists, customer identification, customer prospects, prospective leads or target accounts, and other basic customer information; (d) technical data, specifications, designs, concepts, discoveries, improvements, product plans, research and development information, formulas, compilations, programs, methods, techniques, inventions, devices, systems, and techniques; (e) expansion plans, management policies and other business policies and strategies, (f) business forecasts, financial data, costs, sales and revenue reports, and any analyses not publicly disclosed; (g) employment lists, salary information and other information regarding employees, agents, representatives, consultants and independent contractors of Company; (h) internally developed computer programs and software, computer source codes, integrated computer systems and data, and internal procedures and forms; (i) lists of Company's vendors and C-2
suppliers and terms of service contracts; (j) any Confidential Business Information of any third party which Company is obligated to keep confidential and (k) other information which enables Company to compete successfully. I hereby agree not to use any of the Confidential Business Information for any purpose other than in the course and scope of my employment with Company and for the exclusive benefit of Company. Except for disclosure in the course and scope of my employment with Company and on behalf of Company, I will not at any time, either during or after my employment by Company, directly or indirectly, use, publish, disseminate, copy, distribute or otherwise disclose any Confidential Business Information to any other person or entity. I agree to take all steps necessary, and all steps requested by Company, to ensure that the Confidential Business Information is kept secret and confidential and for the sole use and benefit of Company and to comply with all applicable policies and procedures of Company regarding the storage and security of all Confidential Business Information, whether in hard copy form or stored on computer disks or other electronic media. I also acknowledge that the Confidential Business Information is and has been the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its confidentiality. I acknowledge and agree that the Confidential Business Information is a special and unique asset of Company and derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known by the public or by other persons or entities who can obtain economic value from its disclosure. I further agree that the disclosure of any Confidential Business Information to competitors of Company both during and after my employment with Company, or use of any Confidential Business Information for my own benefit would constitute misappropriation of the Confidential Business Information. I acknowledge that all documents and materials that I prepare, and Confidential Business Information that I may have access to, may be given or entrusted to me or that I may acquire knowledge of in the course of my employment by Company, are and shall remain the sole property of Company. In the event that my employment with Company terminates for any reason, or upon demand by Company, I agree to (i) immediately return or turn over to Company all Confidential Business Information (and any copies thereof) in my possession, custody or control, as well as any documents, notes or other work product, information and other property in my possession, custody or control which is in any way connected with or derived from my services to, or affiliation with, Company, and (ii) sign and return to Company a copy of the "Termination Certificate" attached hereto as Exhibit "A." 3. NON-SOLICITATION OF CLIENTS During my employment with Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment with Company for any reason, I agree not to, either individually or jointly, directly or indirectly, either as an employee, employer, operator, agent, independent contractor, owner, consultant, partner, investor or otherwise, provide to any actual or prospective client of Company serviced by me or with whom I otherwise have dealt while employed by Company any products or services that compete with the C-3
products and services offered, planned to be offered and/or under development by Company during the term of my employment and/or at the time of my employment termination. I agree that during my employment with Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of my employment with Company for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly, call upon or solicit, either for myself or for any other person or entity, any clients or accounts of Company for the purpose of competing, whether directly or indirectly, nor shall I make known to any other person or entity, either directly or indirectly, the names and addresses of and other pertinent information relating to any such clients or accounts, or any Confidential Business Information relating to any of them. I agree that this covenant not to solicit clients is reasonable and necessary to protect Company's legitimate business interests, including, without limitation, the confidential business or professional information and trade secrets of Company, the substantial relationships between Company and its clients, and the goodwill of Company. I also agree that the 12-month duration of this covenant not to solicit clients is reasonable. I further agree that the enforcement of this covenant not to solicit clients, whether by injunctive relief, damages, or otherwise, is in no way contrary to the public health, safety and welfare. 4. NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES I agree that during my employment with Company and for a period of twelve (12) months after the termination of my employment with Company for any reason, I will not, directly or indirectly, myself or through any individual or entity, (i) solicit, induce or attempt to induce away, or aid, assist or abet any other person or entity in soliciting, inducing or attempting to induce away from his/her employment or association with Company any officer, director, employee, independent contractor, consultant, agent, or other personnel or representative of Company, or (ii) otherwise disrupt, impair, damage or interfere with any relationship between Company and any of its officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, consultants, agents, or other personnel or representatives. In addition, I agree that during my employment with Company and for a period of six (6) months after the termination of my employment with Company for any reason, I will not, directly, myself, hire, retain, or engage, or aid, assist or abet any other person or entity in hiring, retaining or engaging, any current officer, director, employee, independent contractor, consultant, agent, or other personnel or representative of Company, or any such person whose relationship with Company terminated either six months prior to or six months after my relationship with Company terminated. I agree that these covenants are reasonable and necessary to protect Company's legitimate business interests, including, without limitation, the confidential business or professional information and trade secrets of Company, the substantial relationships between Company and its officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, consultants, agents, and other personnel or representatives. I also C-4
agree that the 12-month duration of this covenant not to solicit or six-month duration of this covenant not to hire employees is reasonable. I further agree that the enforcement of this covenant not to solicit or hire employees, whether by injunctive relief, damages, or otherwise, is in no way contrary to the public policy. 5. NON-COMPETITION In addition, I agree that during my employment with Company and for a period of four (4) years after the Merger's Effective Date or two (2) years after the termination of my employment with Company for any reason, whichever period is longer, I will not, anywhere in the world, individually or jointly, directly or indirectly, whether as a partner, owner, investor, joint venturer, officer, director, employer, employee, operator, consultant, agent, independent contractor, stockholder or otherwise, engage in or be related to any business or enterprise in competition with the business of Company. I agree that this covenant not to compete is reasonable and necessary to protect Company's legitimate business interests, including, without limitation, the confidential and professional information and trade secrets of Company, the substantial relationships between Company and its customers and clients, and the goodwill of Company. Additionally, I acknowledge and agree that Company provides its products and services on a worldwide basis and, thus, the geographical limitation of this covenant not to compete also is reasonable. I further agree that the enforcement of this covenant not to compete, whether by injunctive relief, damages, or otherwise, is in no way contrary to the public policy. The ownership by me of not more than one percent of the shares of stock of any corporation having a class of equity registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or a foreign country equivalent, shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to violate the prohibitions against competition in this Section 5. 6. OTHER OBLIGATIONS I represent and warrant to Company that I am not under any contract, agreement or restrictive covenant, and have not previously executed any documents whatsoever with any other person, firm, association, or corporation, that will, in any manner, prevent me from performing any of the job duties and responsibilities that may be assigned to me from time to time by Company. I also represent and warrant that I will not bring and have not brought with me to Company and that I will not use in the course and scope of my employment with Company any confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret materials, documents or information that I obtained from a former employer or other individual or entity, without the express written authorization of the pertinent former employer or other individual or entity. I further represent and warrant that, during my employment with Company, I will not breach any obligation or duty to maintain confidential and not to disclose or use that I may owe to any former employer or other individual or entity, and I agree to fulfill and comply with any and all such obligations and duties during my employment by Company. 7. DISCLOSURE AND ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS If at any time during the term of my employment by Company, I (either alone or with others) made, C-5
conceived, discovered, or reduced to practice, or make, conceive, discover or reduce to practice any invention, modification, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, software program, work of authorship, documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, secret or intellectual property right whatsoever or any interest therein (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes or subject to analogous protection) (hereinafter called "Developments") that (i) related or relate to the business of Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured or sold by Company, or which may be used in relation therewith; (ii) resulted or result, directly or indirectly, from tasks, duties and/or responsibilities assigned to me by Company; or (iii) resulted or result, directly or indirectly, from the use of premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by Company, such Developments and the benefits thereof shall be considered work made for hire and shall immediately become the sole and absolute property of Company and its assigns. I agree that I have disclosed, and shall immediately disclose, to Company (or any persons designated by it) each of such Developments and agree to immediately communicate to Company, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto (with all necessary plans and models). If any of the Developments may not, by operation of law or otherwise, be considered work made for hire by me for Company, or if ownership of all right, title, and interest of the intellectual property rights therein shall not otherwise vest exclusively in Company, I hereby assign to Company, and upon the future creation thereof automatically assign to Company, without further consideration, the ownership of all such Developments. I understand and agree that Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name copyrights, patents, registrations, and any other protection available in the Developments. Upon disclosure of each of such Developments to Company, I agree during the term of my employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of Company, to sign, execute, make and do all such deeds, documents, acts and things as Company may reasonably require to perfect and protect all interests therein. NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE 2870 AND SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON MY OWN TIME WITHOUT USING COMPANY'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE DEVELOPMENTS THAT EITHER: (I) RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF THE DEVELOPMENT TO COMPANY'S BUSINESS, OR ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF COMPANY; OR (II) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY ME FOR COMPANY. In the event Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure my signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to any Developments, whether because of my physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on my behalf and stead to execute and file any such application(s) and to C-6
do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to any Developments with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. I represent that the Developments, if any, identified in the Schedule of Separate Works attached hereto as Exhibit "B", comprise all the Developments which I have made or conceived PRIOR to my employment by Company and any of its predecessors. Any such Developments listed in Exhibit B are excluded from and shall not be assigned to Company pursuant to this Agreement. I understand that it is only necessary to list in Exhibit B the title and purpose of such Developments but not details thereof. I also agree not to include, in whole or in part, any Developments listed in Exhibit B in the materials I prepare for Company or otherwise use, in whole or in part, any Developments listed in Exhibit B in connection with my employment by Company unless and until such items are licensed or assigned to Company under separate written agreement. 8. NOTICE TO FUTURE EMPLOYERS AND OF FUTURE EMPLOYMENT I agree and acknowledge that during my employment with Company and for the effective period of the non-competition provision set forth in Section 5, I will inform each prospective new employer I may have, prior to accepting employment, of the existence of this Agreement, and I shall provide each prospective employer with a copy of this Agreement. I also agree and acknowledge that Company has the right to independently contact any potential or actual future employer of mine to notify the future employer of my obligations under this Agreement and provide such future employer with a copy of this Agreement. Company shall also be entitled to notify such actual or potential future employer of Company's understanding of the requirements of this Agreement and what steps, if any, Company intends to take to insure compliance with or enforcement of this Agreement. 9. ENFORCEMENT I understand that if I violate the terms of this Agreement while I am employed by Company, I will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge from my employment. I further agree and acknowledge that the covenants and undertakings contained in this Agreement relate to matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and that a violation or breach of any of the restrictive covenants in this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to Company, the full amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. For that reason, I agree that, in addition to any other remedies, Company will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order, writ of mandamus or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement in the event of an actual, potential or threatened breach of the restrictive covenants in this Agreement. Without regard to whether Company seeks or is granted any such equitable relief, Company will not be prejudiced in its right to seek and be awarded damages for any breach of any restrictive covenant in this Agreement. I understand that the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and will be in addition to any rights and remedies otherwise available to Company under applicable law. I also agree that the existence of any claim or cause of action that I may have against Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a valid defense to the enforcement of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement. C-7
I further agree and acknowledge that should legal proceedings be initiated by Company to enforce the restrictive covenants contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Agreement, the commencement of the duration of said covenants, as the case may be, will commence on the date of the entry of an order granting Company injunctive, monetary or other relief from my actual or threatened breach of said covenants and will remain in effect for the next succeeding six months, 12 months or time period as specified in Section 5, as the case may be. I acknowledge that the purpose and effect of the covenants contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Agreement would be frustrated by measuring the duration of said covenants from the termination of this Agreement where I fail to honor the covenants contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Agreement until directed to do so by court order. 10. AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION This Agreement may not be changed or amended except in writing signed by the parties. 11. SUCCESSORS Expertcity may assign the rights and benefits given to it in this Agreement, to which I expressly agree and this Agreement shall survive any sale of assets, merger, consolidation, or other change in corporate structure. Without limiting the foregoing, I expressly acknowledge and agree that Expertcity currently intends to merge with and into the LLC and further agree that Expertcity shall assign the rights and benefits given to it in this Agreement to the LLC and this Agreement shall survive any such assignment. My obligations under this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment regardless of the manner of such termination and shall be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. Company also may assign its rights and benefits in this Agreement. 12. WAIVER The waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or the breach of any other provision contained in this Agreement. 13. CHOICE OF LAW I understand that this Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California. 14. SEPARATE COVENANTS This Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a series of separate covenants by me, one for each line of business carried on by the Company. The parties expressly agree that the character, duration and geographical scope of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the covenants in Section 5, are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date upon which this Agreement has been executed. However, should a court of competent jurisdiction nonetheless determine at a later date that the character, duration or geographical scope of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the covenants in Section 5, are unreasonable in light of the circumstances as they then exist, then it is my intention and agreement that this Agreement shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only those restrictions on my conduct that are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they then exist and as are necessary to assure the Company of the intended benefit of this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If, in any C-8
judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed included herein because, taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure the Company of the intended benefit of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that those of such covenants (or portions thereof), which, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced in such proceeding shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed eliminated from the provisions hereof. 15. SEVERABILITY Without limiting the applicability of Section 14, it is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in California. Accordingly, if any particular provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable as written, it is the intent and desire of the parties that the court shall modify the language of such provision or portion of this agreement to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If no such modification by the court is possible, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom only the provision or portion thus determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Such modification or deletion is to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such court determination is made. 16. NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT FOR A SPECIFIC TERM Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as giving rise to any contract of employment or guarantee of employment for any fixed period of time. Absent a separate written employment contract for a specific term signed by the parties, I understand that my employment by Company is for an indefinite period of time, is at-will and therefore may be terminated by either me or Company or the Company at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice. 17. HEADINGS Any section or paragraph title or caption contained in this Agreement is for convenience only, and in no way defines, limits or describes the scope or intent of this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof. 18. CONSTRUCTION This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of the fact that the party may be responsible for the drafting of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 19. KNOWLEDGE OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES I have carefully reviewed and completely read all of the provisions of this Agreement and understand and have been advised that I may consult with counsel of my choice for any explanation of my rights, duties, obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement, should I so desire. I acknowledge that I enter into this Agreement of my own free will. C-9
20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Agreement sets forth the complete, sole and entire agreement between the parties on the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all other agreements, negotiations, discussions, proposals, or understandings, whether oral or written, previously entered into, discussed or considered by the parties; provided, however, that for the period from the start of my Expertcity.com, Inc. employment up to and until the date on which I execute this Agreement (the "pre-Citrix term"), the General Employment Terms and Conditions, Invention Assignment Agreement and any other confidentiality and/or invention assignment provision and agreement, all of which I executed as a condition of my Expertcity employment, remain in full force and effect for the pre-Citrix term.

EXHIBIT C Permissible activities:
CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870 (a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.
EXHIBIT D FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT") is entered into as of this __ day of _______, 2004, by and among Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Expertcity.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), Edward Sim (the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE"), and American Stock Transfer & Trust, a New York corporation (the "ESCROW AGENT"). RECITALS WHEREAS, Parent, EAC Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December __, 2003 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), with the Company to be the surviving corporation of the Merger; WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to $33,750,000 in cash (the "ESCROW AMOUNT") is to be paid by Parent, on behalf of the Stockholders, to the Escrow Agent and held in escrow for the purpose of funding claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX of the Merger Agreement; and WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders have appointed the Stockholder Representative to represent them for all purposes in connection with the indemnification provisions of the Merger Agreement and this Escrow Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual obligations and covenants set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. RECEIPT OF ESCROW AMOUNT. By its signature below, the Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount. The parties hereto hereby constitute and appoint the Escrow Agent as, and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to assume and perform the duties of, the escrow agent pursuant to this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent as a trust fund in a separate account (the "ESCROW ACCOUNT") maintained for the purposes, and on the terms and subject to the conditions, set forth in this Agreement. 2. INVESTMENT OF ESCROW AMOUNT. During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Amount and all interest thereon shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent in the investment(s) indicated on SCHEDULE 1. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment in an D-1
investment indicated on SCHEDULE 1 or any investment made pursuant to the instructions of the parties hereto or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to reinvest the Escrow Amount. If the Escrow Agent has not received joint written instructions of Parent and the Stockholder Representative ("JOINT WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS") at any time that an investment decision must be made, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Amount and all interest thereon in commercial paper rated AA. All interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount through the Termination Date shall not become part of the Escrow Amount. For tax purposes, all interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount shall be reported as taxable income of the Parent and the Escrow Agent shall file applicable tax forms consistent with such treatment. The Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow Account annually, no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar year, the amount of such interest and other income earned during such calendar year. The correct taxpayer identification number of Parent and each of the Stockholders is set forth on SCHEDULE 2. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall be provided with a fully completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable, from Parent and each of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent shall file such reports and withhold such taxes as it determines is required by law or regulation. It is expressly agreed and understood that the Escrow Account shall be treated as a grantor trust of the Parent for tax purposes and Parent shall be responsible for filing any applicable tax returns with respect to the interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount. 3. RELEASE OF ESCROW AMOUNT. (a) On each occasion on which Parent determines that any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification for any amount pursuant to Article IX of the Merger Agreement, Parent may deliver to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent a Claim Certificate for the payment of such amount. (b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of a Claim Certificate, the Stockholder Representative may deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent a written objection to all or any part of the Claim Certificate (an "OBJECTION"). The Objection shall set forth in detail the basis of the Stockholder Representative's objection to the Claim Certificate and the amount in dispute. (c) If the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver an Objection to Parent and the Escrow Agent by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the receipt by the Stockholder Representative of a Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Indemnified Parties out of the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the amount requested in the Claim Certificate (up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount). Any such payment shall be made on or before the second (2nd) Business Day following the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. The Escrow Agent shall continue to hold any amounts remaining in the Escrow Account following the payment of any Claim Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (d) If the Stockholder Representative properly delivers a timely Objection with respect to all or any portion of a Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse, and shall continue to hold in the Escrow Account, the amount requested in the Claim Certificate or the disputed portion D-2
thereof, as the case may be, pending receipt of either (i) payment instructions signed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, specifying the agreement of the parties as to the action to be taken by the Escrow Agent in respect of such Claim Certificate ("JOINT PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS") or (ii) a notice from either Parent or the Stockholder Representative stating that either such Claim Certificate has been submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for judgment and that a judgment with respect to such matters has been rendered or such Claim Certificate has been submitted to a panel of arbitrators with proper jurisdiction and that a final non-appealable award with respect to such arbitration has been rendered (in each case, a "JUDGMENT NOTICE") which is accompanied by a copy of a final, nonappealable order of such court or such arbitration panel, as the case may be (each an "ORDER"), pursuant to which such court has determined whether and to what extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the amount requested in the Claim Certificate. Upon receipt of Joint Payment Instructions or a Judgment Notice, as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall thereafter act in accordance with Section 3(e) or 3(f) below, as applicable. A copy of the Judgment Notice or Order shall be delivered to each party at the same time as it is delivered to the Escrow Agent. (e) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Joint Payment Instructions, if such Joint Payment Instructions indicate that any Indemnified Parties are entitled to payment in respect of all or any portion of the Claim Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account and pay to the Indemnified Parties the amount indicated in such Joint Payment Instructions (up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount). Such payment shall be made on or before the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on which such Joint Payment Instructions are received by the Escrow Agent. If such Joint Payment Instructions indicate that the Indemnified Parties are not entitled to all or any portion of the amount claimed in such Claim Certificate (a "DISCHARGE NOTICE"), then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until such amounts are to be disbursed (A) to the Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3(i), 3(j) or 3(k), (B) to any Indemnified Parties in respect of another Claim Certificate pursuant to Sections 3(c), 3(e) or 3(f) or (C) to any Person pursuant to Section 3(l). (f) If the Escrow Agent has received a Judgment Notice and an Order with respect to any Claim Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account and pay to the Indemnified Parties an amount equal to the amount due the Indemnified Parties. Such payment shall be made on or before the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on which the Escrow Agent received such Order. If such Order indicates that the Indemnified Parties were not entitled to all or any portion of the amount claimed in the Claim Certificate (a "DETERMINATION DISCHARGE"), then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount to which the Indemnified Parties were determined not to be entitled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until such amounts are to be disbursed (A) to the Stockholders pursuant to Sections 3(i), 3(j) or 3(k), (B) to any Indemnified Parties in respect of another Claim Certificate pursuant to Sections 3(c), 3(e) or 3(f) or (C) to any Person pursuant to Section 3(l). (g) Upon receipt of written instructions signed by the Stockholder Representative indicating that the Stockholder Representative has incurred expenses in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly reimburse the Stockholder Representative for the amount of such expenses from the Escrow Account; provided that in no event shall the Escrow Agent reimburse the D-3
Stockholder Representative for any amount in excess of $100,000 for all expenses incurred in the aggregate throughout the term of this Agreement; provided further that such $100,000 limit shall in no way limit the Stockholder Representative's right to indemnification under Section 9.5(b) of the Merger Agreement. (h) As promptly as practicable following the disbursement of any funds from the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall send a written statement to the Stockholder Representative and Parent stating the amount of the disbursement and the amounts remaining in the Escrow Account. (i) The twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date is referred to herein as the "INITIAL REDUCTION DATE". On the Initial Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the balance of the Escrow Amount on the Initial Reduction Date over (y) $20,375,000 (such excess being referred to as the "INITIAL ESCROW DISBURSEMENT"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent notifying the Escrow Agent of the Initial Reduction Date, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders the Initial Escrow Disbursement. If, however, the Escrow Agent shall have received on or before the Initial Reduction Date one or more Claim Certificates which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(c) as of the Initial Reduction Date and as to which, on the Initial Reduction Date, the Escrow Agent has not received and fully acted upon Joint Payment Instructions or an Order, nor received a Discharge Notice or a Determination Discharge (any such Claim Certificate being referred to as an "INITIAL OUTSTANDING CLAIM"), the Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to hold in accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the amount requested in all such Initial Outstanding Claims (the "INITIAL RETAINED AMOUNT") but shall pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Initial Escrow Disbursement over the Initial Retained Amount; and, thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account all or portions of the Initial Retained Amount to Parent and/or the Stockholders, as applicable, as and when it receives Joint Payment Instructions, Orders, Discharge Notices or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the Initial Outstanding Claims. Following the Initial Reduction Date, in the event that the Initial Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all Initial Outstanding Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified Parties or which are not subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders within five (5) Business Days of the Stockholder Representative's written request for such payment, an amount equal to such excess. The balance of the Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow to fund claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX of the Merger Agreement. (j) The twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date is referred to herein as the "SECOND REDUCTION DATE". On the Second Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the balance of the Escrow Amount on the Second Reduction Date over (y) the sum of (a) an amount equal to the portion of the Initial Retained Amount not previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(i) hereof and (b) $7,000,000 (such excess being referred to as the "SECOND ESCROW DISBURSEMENT"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent notifying the Escrow Agent of the Second Reduction Date, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders the Second Escrow Disbursement.

Following the Second Reduction Date, in the event that the Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all Outstanding Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified Parties or which are not subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders within five (5) Business Days of the Stockholder Representative's written request for such payment, an amount equal to such excess. The balance of the Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow to fund claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX of the Merger Agreement. (k) The forty-second (42nd) month anniversary of the Closing Date is referred to herein as the "FINAL REDUCTION DATE". On the Final Reduction Date, the Escrow Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the balance of the Escrow Amount on the Final Reduction Date over (y) the portion of the Retained Amount not previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(j) hereof (the "FINAL DISBURSEMENT Amount"). On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the receipt of Joint Written Instructions by the Escrow Agent notifying the Escrow Agent of the Final Reduction Date, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders from the Escrow Account the Final Disbursement Amount. If, however, the Escrow Agent shall have received on or before the Final Reduction Date one or more Claim Certificates which have not been paid in accordance with Section 3(c) as of the Final Reduction Date and which were not included in determining the Retained Amount and as to which, on the Final Reduction Date, the Escrow Agent has not received and fully acted upon Joint Payment Instructions or an Order, nor received a Discharge Notice or a Determination Discharge (all such Claim Certificates, together with the Outstanding Claims, the "FINAL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS"), the Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to hold in accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the amount requested in all such Final Outstanding Claims (all such amounts, together with any portion of the Retained Amount not previously disbursed as provided in Section 3(j), the "FINAL RETAINED AMOUNT") but shall pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Disbursement Amount over the Final Retained Amount; and thereafter the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account to Parent D-5
and/or Stockholders, as applicable, all or portions of the Final Retained Amount as and when it receives Joint Payment Instructions, Orders, Discharge Notices or Determination Discharges, as applicable, related to the Final Outstanding Claims. Following the Final Reduction Date, in the event that the Final Retained Amount at anytime exceeds the amount of all Final Outstanding Claims which have not been paid to the Indemnified Parties or which are not subject to a Discharge Notice or Determination Discharge, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholders within three (3) Business Days of the Stockholder Representative's written request for such payment, an amount equal to such excess. (l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Escrow Agent shall receive Joint Written Instructions to release all or a portion of the Escrow Amount, then within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such Joint Written Instructions, the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Amount in accordance with such Joint Written Instructions. The parties will cooperate in good faith in executing such Joint Written Instructions whenever reasonably necessary to ensure distributions of escrowed funds to the party entitled thereto under the terms of the Merger Agreement. The date on which the entire Escrow Amount has been disbursed from the Escrow Account shall be referred to herein as the "TERMINATION DATE." 4. DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT. (a) DUTIES IN GENERAL.

Upon the happening of either of the above, the Escrow Agent shall be fully relieved and discharged of any further duties hereunder. (3) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise by Joint Written Instructions or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, if the Escrow Agent should at any time be confronted with inconsistent claims or demands by the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall also have the right to interplead such parties in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware (or if such court does not have jurisdiction, any other court of competent jurisdiction), to deposit the Escrow Amount with the clerk of such court, and to request that such court determine the respective rights of the parties with respect to this Agreement, and upon doing so, the Escrow Agent automatically shall be released from any obligations or liability as a consequence of any claims or demands hereunder. D-6
(b) EXCULPATION.

(c) NO ADDITIONAL DUTIES.

Upon their receipt of notice of D-7
resignation from the Escrow Agent, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts jointly to designate a successor Escrow Agent. If the parties do not agree upon a successor Escrow Agent within fifteen (15) Business Days after the receipt by the parties of the Escrow Agent's resignation notice, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent or other appropriate relief and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all parties hereto. By mutual agreement, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall have the right at any time upon not less than seven (7) Business Days written notice to terminate their appointment of the Escrow Agent, or any successor Escrow Agent, as the Escrow Agent hereunder.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Earnings; Fourth Quarter Revenues of $157.7 Million; GAAP Earnings Per Share of $0.21; Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.22 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2004-- Annual Revenues of $588.6, Up 12% over 2002; GAAP Earnings Per Share of $0.74; Adjusted Annual Earnings Per Share of $0.78, Up 39% Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Financial Results Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 were $157.7 million compared to $148.8 million in the same period of the prior year, a 6% increase. Net income was $36.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or $0.21 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to $39.6 million, or $0.23 per share on a GAAP basis, in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, was $38.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or $0.22 per share, compared to $40.6 million, or $0.23 per share, in the comparable period of the prior year. Annual revenues for 2003 were $588.6 million, compared to $527.4 million in the previous year, a 12% increase. Annual net income for 2003 was $126.9 million, or $0.74 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to net income for 2002 of $93.9 million, or $0.52 per share on a GAAP basis. Annual net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, was $134.2 million, or $0.78 per share for 2003, compared to $100.8 million, or $0.56 per share for 2002. "It was a solid quarter to end a very strong year," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "In 2003 we saw tremendous growth in larger purchases, in our Subscription Advantage program, and in deferred revenue as our customers made larger and longer-term commitments to Citrix. In addition, we executed well, improving our year-end operating margin by 6.5 percentage points to 26.2%. "And we've kicked off 2004 aggressively," Templeton said. "Last week we held our first annual Global Summit Week, where we trained more than 2,000 members of our channel community and our worldwide sales force. They learned about new products and programs that will help them offer more value to customers as trusted advisors, recommending complete access solutions. "Enthusiasm within Citrix and our partner ecosystem is at an all-time high. It's well-founded. We have the right products, the right partners, and the right programs working synergistically to achieve our growth and operating goals. "We'll continue to invest in expanding our product portfolio, to grow in emerging countries, and to scale the organization -- both people and infrastructure -- so that we can execute on our strategy of making Citrix synonymous with access." Financial Highlights -- Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 6% over the comparable period last year; annual revenues grew 12%. -- Deferred revenue grew by $20.5 million, approximately 14%, during the quarter to a total of $165.1 million. Annually, deferred revenue grew by 59%. -- Operating margin was 26.8% for the quarter; adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%, excluding the effect of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations. Operating margin for 2003 was 26.2%, up from 19.7% in 2002. -- Cash flow from operations was approximately $69.0 million for the quarter. -- Cash and investments totaled approximately $898.3 million at the end of the quarter. -- During the quarter, the company repurchased about 0.7 million shares at an average net price per share of $23.24. For the year, Citrix repurchased 8.9 million shares at an average price of $15.86. Customer Highlights Citrix closed several large deals during the quarter, including British Airport Authority, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina and DaimlerChrysler. Citrix signed a deal with the British Airport Authority (BAA), which owns and operates seven airports including the world's busiest international airport, London Heathrow, and has management contracts or stakes in numerous other major transportation hubs around the globe. Serving more than 200 million passengers worldwide, BAA has implemented 10,000 licenses of the Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Access Suite to provide secure access to more than 500 applications from the organization's numerous airports, retail locations and the runways themselves, enabling the company to focus on its customers' needs and safety. Founded in 1946 and with more than 12,000 employees, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of South Carolina provides nearly one million South Carolinians with health insurance. With Citrix access infrastructure, BCBS of South Carolina delivers industry-specific insurance applications instantly and reliably to more than 16,000 users at offices throughout South Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Texas. As a result, BCBS of South Carolina can easily transition employees currently working in headquarter facilities to work from home. In addition, Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server will also enable the company to quickly integrate newly acquired business units into its corporate IT environment. DaimlerChrysler, one of the world's leading automotive companies, sells passenger cars and commercial vehicles under brands including Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Jeep(R) and Dodge. To improve application deployment, DaimlerChrysler ordered nearly 3,000 licenses of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server and has already nearly 7,000 additional seats. With Citrix access infrastructure, DaimlerChrysler benefits from secure, easy and instant access to Microsoft(R) Office, Lotus Notes and numerous proprietary applications. Alliance Highlights During the fourth quarter, Citrix strengthened relationships with key partners including Microsoft, IBM, SAP, HP, and PeopleSoft. -- Microsoft named Citrix its first "Global Independent Software Vendor Partner of the Year." The honor was given to Citrix for delivering the best customer solutions as a Microsoft(R) Global Gold Certified Partner for Software Products. Also in October, Citrix announced its support of the Microsoft Office System, which includes all Microsoft Office branded programs, servers, services and solutions. The two companies have been working together for well over a decade in support of joint customers' business objectives. -- Citrix signed a systems integration agreement with IBM, which allows IBM to offer the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite of products to IBM eServer(R) xSeries customers. In addition, the two companies announced that their decade-long strategic relationship would now include the release of a new portlet that provides integration with IBM WebSphere Portal(R), giving joint customers secure, easy and instant access to information resources managed by Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server through their WebSphere Portal. -- Citrix and SAP announced expanded development work encompassing the seamless integration of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server and SAP(R) Enterprise Portal, a technology solution of the SAP NetWeaver(TM) Technology Suite. -- Citrix announced in October its support for HP's Adaptive Enterprise strategy with HP OpenView certification and a new probe tool for optimizing system performance. Citrix also joined the HP OpenView Solution Alliance Program at the enhanced Solution Partner level. -- Citrix announced an expanded integration agreement with PeopleSoft. Citrix said it would make available a template "pagelet" that will make it easier for PeopleSoft(R) Enterprise Portal customers to deploy non-PeopleSoft applications to the portal using the web interface feature of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server. Business Outlook Citrix management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2004: -- Revenue is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $156 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2004. -- GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.18 for the quarter ending March 31, 2004. -- Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, is expected to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.19 for the quarter ending March 31, 2004. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements also do not include the effects of either the closing of the acquisition of Expertcity, Inc., or the tender or redemption of the company's convertible debentures if either should occur in the quarter ending March 31, 2004. For a discussion of these effects, please see "Definitive Agreement to Acquire Expertcity" and "Convertible Debentures" below. Definitive Agreement to Acquire Expertcity In December, Citrix announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Expertcity, Inc., the market leader in Web-based desktop access as well as a leader in Web-based training and customer assistance products. The transaction is valued at approximately $225 million in cash and stock, and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2004 or early in the second quarter of 2004. A $12 million earnout will be paid to all Expertcity stockholders if certain financial targets are achieved in 2004. The transaction is expected to be $0.03 to $0.04 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share in the first half of fiscal year 2004, as adjusted to exclude the effect of amortization and an expense charge for the value of Expertcity's in-process research and development (which will result in an additional $0.05-$0.10 dilution to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis), and neutral to adjusted earnings in the second half of 2004. The impact of the acquisition is not included in the forward-looking statements included in "Business Outlook" above. The acquisition expands Citrix's portfolio of access products to include Expertcity's popular GoToMyPC(R) software service for secure, browser-based access to desktop PCs from anywhere over the Web. The acquisition also will add Expertcity's market-leading GoToAssist(TM) service, which provides online help-desk and call center assistance, as well as training and customer collaboration over the Web. Convertible Debentures In March 1999, Citrix sold $850 million principal amount at maturity of the company's zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in March 2019. Citrix can redeem the debentures on or after March 22, 2004, and the holders of the debentures can require the company to repurchase the debentures on fixed dates and at set redemption prices (equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount) beginning on March 22, 2004. If either of these two events were to occur, the company expects to incur a non-cash charge to earnings in the amount of approximately $7 million to account for unamortized debt issuance costs. The effect of this potential charge is not included in the forward-looking statements included in "Business Outlook" above.

The combined business will help accelerate Citrix's growth in the access infrastructure market, a market that is expected to reach $8-10 billion in the next three to four years. "With this acquisition, Citrix is uniting two market leaders focused on access - the leader in access infrastructure solutions and the leader in Web-based desktop access - to create one source for complete and secure access solutions," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Now, no matter where a company's applications and information live - whether on the server, the desktop, or both - users will be able to access them on demand with Citrix access infrastructure." Citrix announced a definitive agreement to purchase Expertcity on December 18, 2003. With the completion of the acquisition, Citrix is expanding its portfolio of access products to include Expertcity's popular GoToMyPC(R) software service for secure, browser-based and managed access to desktop PCs from anywhere. The acquisition also adds Expertcity's market-leading GoToAssist(TM) software service, which provides secure and reliable Web-based technical support and customer collaboration. GoToMyPC and GoToAssist will now become part of Citrix access infrastructure for the on-demand enterprise. Citrix will also leverage Expertcity's e-commerce infrastructure and expertise in online marketing, selling and fulfillment. Citrix acquired Expertcity for approximately $225 million, payable in approximately 50% cash and 50% stock. An additional amount up to $12 million in stock will be paid to all Expertcity stockholders if certain financial milestones are achieved by Expertcity in 2004. Expertcity will continue to operate in Santa Barbara, Calif., as the Citrix Online Division. Andreas von Blottnitz, Expertcity's former president and chief executive officer, will serve as president of the division reporting directly to Templeton.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated April 21, 2004 of Citrix Systems, Inc.

Exhibit 99 Citrix Reports First Quarter Earnings FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2004-- First Quarter Revenues of $161.3 Million; GAAP Earnings Per Share of $0.05 Include Debenture Redemption and Expertcity Acquisition Costs; Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.19 Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. FINANCIAL RESULTS Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2004 were $161.3 million, compared to $143.5 million in the same period of the prior year, a 12.4% increase. Net income was $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2004, or $0.05 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, compared to $30.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, in the comparable period of the prior year. As expected, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share were down in the first quarter of 2004 as compared to the comparable period of the prior year due to a charge for in-process research and development of $18.7 million in connection with the acquisition of Expertcity and a charge of approximately $7.2 million for the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of the company's convertible subordinated debentures. Net income, adjusted to exclude the effects of these charges and the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, was $32.8 million for the first quarter of 2004, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $32.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the comparable period of the prior year. "We're reporting solid results for the first quarter, and I am quite pleased," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Our results for the first quarter demonstrate we are building on the progress and momentum we established last year. Our focus is paying off - access is a growing strategic priority for organizations, and Citrix access infrastructure is a compelling solution.

Citrix accessPARTNER Network At January's Citrix Solutions Summit(TM), the company's annual global partner conference, Citrix unveiled the Citrix accessPARTNER network, the new name for the company's global network of partners. The new partner network unifies a strong ecosystem of solution advisors, educators and alliance partners to meet specific customer needs in developing and executing an access strategy. In addition to the new partner network, Citrix introduced Advisor Rewards, a program that provides a new way for Citrix channel partners to enhance their profitability from sales of the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite. Combining the industry's best incentive vehicles, Advisor Rewards provides monetary rewards for Citrix Solution Advisors (formerly resellers within the Citrix Solutions Network(TM)) that register deals, submit sales forecasts earlier in the volume licensing sales process and provide value-based solution selling around the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite. The rewards can reach as high as 10 percent incremental margin of the suggested licensing price of the products sold and are available to Citrix Solution Advisors. The new program gives Solution Advisors a fixed commission rate for driving demand - no matter where the customer fulfills the licenses - rewarding value-added selling efforts.

In conjunction with the next phase of the integration process, Andreas von Blottnitz, who has successfully led Citrix Online for the past five years, will be leaving Citrix in the fourth quarter. von Blottnitz sees this new phase of integration as the best time for a smooth transition. Brett Caine, senior vice president of sales for Citrix Online, will assume the responsibilities of president beginning August 1, 2004. von Blottnitz will continue to consult with the company to ensure a smooth transition through October 1, 2004. Caine has successfully run sales for Citrix Online for the past year, helping the business reach its sales goals and providing additional operational discipline. Caine will report to John Burris, senior vice president of worldwide sales and services for Citrix. "Brett has delivered outstanding results since joining the division," said Klaus Schauser, founder and chief technology officer for Citrix Online. "Brett has the full support of the management team in Santa Barbara as well as the executive team at Citrix to lead the division and drive a smooth hand-off.

Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Net6 Inc., a leader in providing secure access gateways. The all-cash transaction is valued at approximately $50 million and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2004.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. and SAN JOSE, Calif.  Nov. 23, 2004 
 
The Net6
acquisition gives Citrix:
 
 
 
 
"This is an exciting day for Citrix customers and partners," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "This acquisition consolidates our leadership role in the access infrastructure market, simplifies access and access security, and gives us an opportunity to tap the potential of IP voice applications on IP telephones.
"With Net6, we'll be able to provide a single point of access from any device to any IT resource over an SSL secure connection, providing on-demand access to both voice and data across virtually any screen size, device type and location.
 
"We're making the last mile of computing secure, simple for users and adaptable to almost any access scenario. Only Citrix can do this."
 
Net6 has two major products focused on access, both in growth markets  SSL Access Gateway and Application Gateway with Voice Office Application Suite.
 
SSL Access Gateway
 
Net6's SSL Access Gateway delivers an innovative and superior alternative to IPSec and traditional SSL VPNs. It gives Citrix a simpler approach to providing secure access to private resources over the Internet, and can be used in conjunction with existing Citrix access infrastructure solutions. When used as the single point of access, this gateway greatly reduces the complexity and cost involved in managing several different access scenarios for users. The gateway allows users to access information technology (IT) resources in the same secure way  whether they are in front of or behind the firewall  giving them the same experience regardless of location. For the administrator, installation and configuration of both the client and appliance is quick and easy, and helps reduce the need for some types of additional security mechanisms.
 
Citrix will offer the SSL Access Gateway as a compelling stand-alone access solution, and with its always-on and single point of secure access functionality, and as part of the Citrix
MetaFrame
Access Suite, it will enhance Citrix's SmoothRoaming and upcoming SmartAccess capabilities.
 
Application Gateway and Voice Office Application Suite
 
Net6's Application Gateway
and Voice Office
Application Suite deliver productivity applications to users of IP telephones and mobile devices. The Net6 Voice Office Application Suite enables enterprises to further leverage their IP telephony investment and increase workforce productivity by delivering converged applications to the screens and speakers of IP telephones. The Application Gateway delivers applications to users of IP telephones from leading IP PBX vendors including Avaya, Cisco, Mitel, NEC, Nortel Networks and Siemens.
 
Net6 has been in the IP telephony and VoIP market since its founding in 2000 and brings extensive skills and experience to Citrix in this area. Net6 also brings new competencies in packaging software as an appliance to complement Citrix's existing software license and services business.
Converging Voice, Data and Applications to Enable the Ultimate Mobile Office
 
Templeton said the combination of Citrix and Net6 technologies will enable the creation of an unrivaled end-to-end access infrastructure system that converges voice, data and applications.
 
The combined technologies could support several different types of user scenarios. For example:
 
 
 
 
 
With the SSL Access Gateway serving as a single entry point, these services and resources can be accessed securely by a wide range of devices including IP phones and soft phones, simply and cost-efficiently.
 
"Businesses today are trying to manage access to their IT resources across several dimensions," said Templeton. "They have to factor in all the different network scenarios, such as wired or wireless, trusted or untrusted, public or private; the type of devices being used, such as IP phones, PDAs or notebooks, managed or unmanaged, trusted or untrusted.
 
"It is a complex problem that, until now, has been solved with various tactical and ad-hoc solutions. Our new approach, which regards voice as a data type, will enable a common, single gateway to accommodate application, data and voice application access needs simply and cost effectively."
 
Located in San Jose, Calif., Net6 has approximately 30 employees and more than 150 customers.
 
"Citrix is the leader in access infrastructure market and with the price points and disruptive feature capabilities of the Net6 Access Gateways, we can accelerate our growth through global distribution channels," said Murli Thirumale, president and chief executive officer of Net6. "Our network-integrated appliance technology and unique VoIP solutions bring Citrix customers significant new value, and Citrix channels new revenue streams."
Terms of the Deal
 
Under terms of the definitive agreement, Citrix will acquire Net6 for approximately $50 million, payable in cash. Assuming the transaction closes as expected, the transaction will result in approximately a $1 to $3 million expense charge for in-process research and development in the fourth quarter, which equates to approximately $0.01 per share. The remaining purchase consideration will be allocated among acquired net tangible and intangible assets and goodwill.
 
In the first half of 2005, the transaction is expected to be $0.03 to $0.04 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis and $0.02 to $0.03 on an adjusted basis to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets. The transaction is expected to be neutral to accretive to earnings in the second half of 2005.
 
The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company, and has been approved by the stockholders of Net6. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Net6 will continue to operate in San Jose, Calif., led by Murli Thirumale reporting to Mark Templeton.
 
Conference Call Information

On December 21, 2004, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), announced a technology collaboration agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Microsoft"). In conjunction with the Collaboration Agreement, Citrix and Microsoft entered into a Microsoft Master Source Code Agreement (the "2004 Source Code Agreement") and a License Form, each dated December 16, 2004 (together with the 2004 Source Code Agreement, the "2004 License Agreements"). The 2004 License Agreements renew Citrix's access to source code for current versions of Microsoft Windows Server that had previously been provided to Citrix pursuant to the Microsoft Master Source Code Agreement between Citrix and Microsoft dated May 15, 2002 (the "2002 Source Code Agreement") and the License Form between Citrix and Microsoft dated May 15, 2002 (together with the 2002 Source Code Agreement, the "2002 License Agreements"). More information about the 2002 License Agreements is included in Item 1.02 below. There are no material relationships among Citrix, Microsoft or their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the 2004 License Agreements and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves.
 
The 2004 License Agreements permit Citrix, during the five-year term of such agreements, to use source code for Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and Windows Server 2003, including terminal services source code and future versions of Windows Server 2003 (collectively, "Microsoft Source Code"), for purposes of developing Citrix's terminal services and client software products. Microsoft may terminate the 2004 License Agreements before the expiration date of the five-year term for a material breach by Citrix and upon a change of control of Citrix. The 2004 License Agreements do not provide for payments to or from Microsoft.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 16, 2004, Citrix and Microsoft terminated the 2002 License Agreements, which were originally scheduled to expire on May 15, 2005 pursuant to their terms. The 2002 License Agreements formalized Citrix's access to source code for Microsoft Windows Server 2000 and future server operating systems, including access to terminal services source code. The 2002 License Agreements did not provide for payments to or from Microsoft. Simultaneously with the termination of the 2002 License Agreements, Citrix and Microsoft entered into the 2004 License Agreements described in Item 1.01 above in order to renew the arrangements established by the 2002 License Agreements. The Collaboration Agreement provides for access by Citrix to the source code for the forthcoming version of Microsoft Windows Server codenamed "Longhorn".
 
There are no material relationships among Citrix, Microsoft or their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the 2002 License Agreements and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves. Citrix incurred no early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the 2002 License Agreements.

"In the quarter, we saw double-digit software license revenue growth over last year's fourth quarter; license revenue from new products reached the high end of our target range; and we experienced very strong sequential growth in EMEA. "For the year, we saw strength in three key areas: in our subscription business, our new products, and in our core enterprise business. In addition, we executed well, maintaining our adjusted operating margins in the desired range of mid-to-upper 20 percent while investing for the future. "In addition to our strong financial results, in 2004 we made both company and technology acquisitions to expand into adjacent markets and double the number of offerings in our product portfolio. We also continued to increase the company's visibility worldwide and articulate the strategic value of access infrastructure. "We just kicked off the year with our annual Global Summit Week, where we trained over 2,600 members of our channel community and worldwide sales force. We look forward to solid execution in 2005, and we're off to a great start."

Customer Highlights Citrix closed several large customer sales during the quarter, including ADESA, Arla Foods, ICTRO and SHCP Servicio de Administracion Tributaria. ADESA, North America's largest publicly traded provider of wholesale vehicle auctions and used-vehicle-dealer floorplan-financing, licensed 2,900 seats of Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Presentation Server 3.0. The growing company uses MetaFrame Presentation Server to deploy all applications from its headquarters in Indianapolis to each of its 50-plus remote auction locations, eliminating costs associated with visiting each locale for application upgrades and database maintenance. The largest dairy company in Europe, Arla Foods, has licensed 6,700 seats of the Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Access Suite to provide its employees with secure, instant access to business information and centrally manage key enterprise applications. Arla Foods, a vast co-operative owned by 11,600 Swedish and Danish milk producers, intends to standardize on Citrix access infrastructure to maintain its strong presence in markets spanning more than 27 countries. In addition, by enabling the company's workforce to access supply chain applications from any connection in real-time, Arla Foods will further develop its position as an innovative global supplier of added value, milk-based ingredients for consumers throughout the world. ICTRO, the information systems organization in charge of maintaining the information technology infrastructure and applications for the courts and prosecution services in the Netherlands, selected Citrix access infrastructure to streamline its datacenter, enabling its large staff of judges, lawyers and support personnel to have on-demand, real-time access to key agency applications. With 5,000 additional licenses of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, over 15,000 ICTRO employees now have a secure, centralized platform to protect confidential government data from unauthorized access while being able to deploy new applications quickly and easily. SHCP Servicio de Administracion Tributaria, the federal tax collection agency in Mexico, recently acquired 1,000 seats of the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite as a part of its access strategy. With the full suite the government agency is also fulfilling a new business continuity initiative. Product and Alliance Highlights During the fourth quarter, Citrix: -- Signed a five-year agreement with Microsoft Corporation that enables Citrix to deliver more comprehensive access solutions on the Microsoft(R) Windows(R) platform and will improve the access capabilities available in the forthcoming version of Windows Server(TM) codenamed "Longhorn." -- Acquired privately held Net6 Inc., a leader in providing secure access gateways.

The acquisition will enable Citrix to offer an unrivaled end-to-end access infrastructure system for voice, data and applications on a single, always-on gateway that can be accessed securely from a wide range of devices. -- Strengthened its strategic alliance with SAP AG by extending its SAP(R) Global Technology partnership to include membership in the SAP NetWeaver(TM) Partner Initiative. Further, in the first quarter of 2005, Citrix and SAP announced that the companies will offer a joint offering for small and mid-size businesses (SMB) that bundles SAP Business One with Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server. The companies also have unveiled a go-to-market strategy for the joint offering. -- Launched the Citrix Online suite of products in Australia and New Zealand, targeting individuals, SMB and large organizations through channel partners in the South Pacific. -- Formed an alliance with ViewSonic(R) Corp., a worldwide leader in visual display products, to offer a wireless computing solution with a 60-day free trial of Citrix(R) GoToMyPC(R) with every ViewSonic airsync(TM) V210 wireless display. -- Launched Citrix(R) GoToMeeting(TM) Corporate 1.1 with the capability of hosting scheduled online meetings for up to 200 attendees.

On February 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Citrix Systems, Inc.

The Bonus Plan establishes target bonus levels for each Participant expressed as a percentage of each Participant's base salary. The 2005 bonuses will be paid based on the achievement of certain company-wide, geographic segment and and/or individual goals. The actual bonus payments may be less than or greater than the target bonus amounts depending on whether and the extent to which the goals upon which such bonuses are based are achieved. Except under certain circumstances, bonus awards are payable following the conclusion of fiscal year 2005. The Compensation Committee and/or the Board of Directors retain the right to amend, alter or terminate the Bonus Plan at any time.

participation is approved. New Participants approved for the Plan may be eligible to receive a bonus (prorated based on the number of full and partial months remaining in the performance period) for the achievement of individual performance measures, as recommended by the President & CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
C. . For all Participants other than the VP, EMEA, bonus awards are tied solely to the achievement of corporate financial targets ("Financial Targets").

Bonus awards are subject to a minimum performance requirement before any award may be earned. The performance requirements are as follows:
 
 
 
For purposes of this Plan, EPS shall be calculated on an adjusted basis that specifically excludes amortization of intangible assets, write-offs of in-process research and development, charges associated with the expensing of equity-based compensation and other adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
Financial components and weightings will be reviewed periodically throughout the year to ensure continued alignment with the Company's business strategy and objectives. Upon the recommendation of the President & CEO and approval of the Compensation Committee, the financial components and weightings may be adjusted at such time to reflect changes in business priorities.
 
 
In the event of the under-achievement by the Company of the Financial Targets, or geo financial target (as the case may be), for each financial component category but subject to the requirements of subsections IV.C (1) and (2) above, bonus awards will be adjusted downwards from the Plan Participant's target bonus award as follows:

For all Participants other than the VP, EMEA:
 
 
For VP, EMEA:
 
 
 
EMEA, up to twenty-five percent (25%) of targeted bonus awards will be paid quarterly in cash based on the applicable percentage achieved of each associated Financial Target, or geo financial target (as the case may be), with a reconciliation based on final achievement of Financial Targets, or geo financial target (as the case may be), at year-end.

Today the Company will file its restated consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements in an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and in amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Systems Announces Restatement of Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements Consistent With Previously Disclosed Presentation of Certain Restricted Cash and Investments FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 7, 2005-- No Effect on Historical or Future Revenues, Net Income, Earnings Per Share or Cash Flow from Operations Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today announced that it will restate the presentation of cash and investments on its balance sheet. As previously disclosed in the unaudited balance sheet that accompanied the Company's fourth quarter and year-end earnings press release issued by the Company on January 27, 2005, Citrix will present collateral pledged under the Company's synthetic lease, credit default contracts and interest rate swaps as restricted cash equivalents and investments. The nature and extent of all pledged collateral arrangements and restrictions have been fully and consistently disclosed from the inception of each arrangement in narrative form in the Company's reports filed with the SEC. The Company previously believed that its audited balance sheets and cash flow statements, which reflected pledged collateral in cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of a normal periodic review of the Company's financial reports by the staff of the SEC, the Company has reevaluated its presentation of cash and investments and will present pledged collateral on its balance sheet as restricted. The Company's balance sheet adjustments will not in any way affect the Company's historical or future revenues, net income, earnings per share, cash flow from operations, total assets or total cash and investments. Moreover, these adjustments do not change the Company's liquidity position or its ability to access its funds. The Company is restating its consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and for the first three quarters of 2004 to revise its presentation of cash and investments. The Company filed its restated financial statements with the SEC today. Citrix additionally reclassified, or adjusted its financial statement presentation for, the following items in its restated financial statements: -- expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangibles from amortization expense to a component of cost of revenues in the Company's consolidated income statement; -- proceeds from sales and maturities of the Company's investments, as well as cash flows from the Company's available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, now presented separately in the Company's cash flow statement; and -- investments in auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments pursuant to a recently published accounting interpretation. The Company does not currently anticipate any additional revisions to the Company's previously reported fiscal 2004 results of operations and financial position in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which the Company anticipates filing with the SEC on or before March 16, 2005. A reconciliation of amounts previously reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements to adjusted balances is included in this press release. About Citrix Citrix Systems, Inc.

(Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended March 31, 2005. Financial Results In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Citrix achieved revenue of $202 million, compared to $161 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, representing 25 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $39 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $9.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Non-GAAP Results Adjusted net income, in the first quarter of 2005 increased 28 percent to $42 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $33 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Net income in the first quarter of 2005 was adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets and amortization of deferred stock-based compensation and in the first quarter of 2004 was adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and in-process research and development. "We posted a solid quarter with strong execution and growth across the company, continuing the momentum into 2005," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Compared to the first quarter of 2004, we saw double-digit growth in all regions, including the Americas; impressive momentum from Citrix Online, including strong growth from Citrix GoToMeeting; and growth in new product revenue, especially with the Access Suite. "Our results show excellent execution as well as leverage from our expanded product portfolio. "On April 26, at our third annual Strategy Day, we will outline additional details of how the company plans to leverage its investments in the access infrastructure market."

These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix To Expand Access Platform with Acquisition of NetScaler; Citrix Aggressively Driving Its Strategy to Enable the Best Access Experience for Every User and Every Application -- Everywhere FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 2, 2005--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held NetScaler, Inc., a global leader in high-performance application networking. The transaction is valued at approximately $300 million in cash and stock, plus the assumption of approximately $23 million in unvested stock options. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2005 subject to customary closing conditions including shareholder and regulatory approvals. NetScaler, founded in 1998, is based in San Jose, Calif., and has approximately 200 employees, with research and development teams in Silicon Valley and India. The company pioneered the market for next-generation application networking acceleration and initially rose to prominence in the Internet market, delivering technology to top companies such as Google, Amazon, Dow Jones, Earthlink, E rade, MSN and Ticketmaster. Today, NetScaler estimates that up to 75 percent of all Internet users go through a NetScaler system each day. NetScaler now has more than 500 enterprise customers and over 3,000 deployments of its award-winning products, including Fortune 500 leaders Merrill Lynch, JC Penney, 7-Eleven, Blue Cross, Ford and United Airlines, and is consistently ranked number one in both performance and customer satisfaction. "This is an exciting acquisition for Citrix," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We're aggressively pursuing the strategy we outlined in early 2003 to expand into high-growth markets adjacent to the access infrastructure market through building and acquiring best of breed access infrastructure technologies. "With this acquisition, our existing customers will further lower costs and increase the performance of their Citrix Presentation Server systems, and we'll be able to offer greater performance and lower costs for customers deploying Web-based applications and services. "NetScaler extends our best access experience value for the entire range of Web-based applications, including enterprise, browser-based, XML Web services, and others. And, with NetScaler accelerators, Citrix customers can significantly optimize their entire set of legacy, client/server, or three-tier applications delivered on our Presentation Server system," said Templeton. "By adding NetScaler products to the Citrix Access Platform, we are the only company offering a complete system that provides end users with the best access experience and delivers cost-saving benefits to IT staffs through reduced overhead, enhanced security and increased manageability of all enterprise applications and resources." Bringing a New Level of Intelligence to OSI (Open System Interconnection) Layers 4-7 NetScaler products will extend the Citrix Access Platform and provide a range of application networking solutions. Application networking is a fast-growing, emerging segment of the overall networking market expected to grow to about $3 billion by 2007 according to market research. Unlike traditional networking products that focus on the underlying connectivity between systems and networks, application networking solutions provide application layer intelligence called "application fluency." This ensures that every user receives the best possible access experience based on their role, device, network and location, as well as the specific application or service being accessed. And IT organizations can reduce the overall costs in their data centers by reducing network overhead and the number of servers needed to run enterprise applications. While some traditional networking products may be "application-aware," only application networking products can make networks truly "application-fluent." In addition, with NetScaler adding to the built-in intelligence of the system, the Citrix Access Platform will dynamically choose the best possible delivery method for each access session, automatically sensing and responding appropriately to each user's access scenario to deliver the best access experience. Strong Execution on Citrix's Growth Strategy In 2004, Citrix completed two acquisitions as part of its strategy to drive growth by offering the industry's most complete, integrated access platform. In the first quarter, Citrix acquired Expertcity, now the Citrix Online division, moving the company into the real-time collaboration, desktop access and on-demand assistance markets. In the fourth quarter, Citrix acquired Net6, now the Citrix Gateways division, extending Citrix's reach in the SSL VPN (secure socket layer virtual private network) and IP (internet protocol) telephony markets. "This is a great move for Citrix and a great fit for NetScaler. Both companies are committed to making customers successful and improving the experience for end users accessing any application," said B.V. Jagadeesh, president and chief executive officer for NetScaler. "Our combined teams will be a powerful force in providing the infrastructure required for intelligently controlling access and delivery of any application or resource based on the end-user's scenario. Further, we expect that the demand for NetScaler products will grow significantly as we leverage Citrix's 5,000 plus resellers in more than 100 countries - one of the most loyal and well developed channels in the industry." "NetScaler will bring to Citrix key leadership, award-winning products and critical competencies in the areas of networking and security," added Templeton. "Further, the NetScaler business culture is a great fit with Citrix in terms of shared values, a passion for customer success and a desire to deliver complete end-to-end access solutions for on-demand computing. The NetScaler team will give Citrix increased presence in Silicon Valley and the ability to attract top industry talent in the Bay Area to keep pace with our plans for continued rapid growth." Terms of the Deal Under terms of the definitive agreement, Citrix will acquire NetScaler for approximately $300 million, payable in approximately 45 percent cash and 55 percent stock. Citrix will also assume approximately $23 million in unvested options. Assuming the transaction closes as expected, the transaction is expected to result in approximately a $5 million to $6 million expense charge for in-process research and development (IPR&D) in the third quarter, which equates to approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share on a GAAP basis. The remaining purchase consideration will be allocated among acquired net tangible and intangible assets and goodwill. For the three months ended September 30, 2005, the transaction is expected to add $5 million to $6 million in revenue and is expected to be $0.06 to $0.07 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.02 to $0.03 on an adjusted basis to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, write-off of IPR&D and compensation expense. For the three months ended December 31, 2005, the transaction is expected to add $10 million to $12 million in revenue and is expected to be $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.02 to $0.03 on an adjusted basis to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets and compensation expense. For 2006, the transaction is expected to add between $58 million and $60 million in revenue. In the first half of 2006, the transaction is expected to be $0.11 to $0.12 dilutive to Citrix's earnings per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive to earnings on an adjusted basis to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets and compensation expense. In the second half of 2006, we expect the acquisition to be dilutive on a GAAP basis and neutral to accretive to earnings on an adjusted basis. The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2005 and is subject to closing conditions including regulatory review and approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, approval by the stockholders of NetScaler and other customary conditions. NetScaler will continue to operate in San Jose, Calif. as the Application Networking Group, and will be led by B.V. Jagadeesh, reporting to Citrix CEO Mark Templeton.

FINANCIAL RESULTS GAAP Results In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Citrix achieved revenue of $211.2 million, compared to $178.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, representing 18 percent revenue growth. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $27.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share - which included a net tax provision of approximately $16 million recorded in anticipation of repatriating certain foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) - compared to net income of $31.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

"Our second quarter results were excellent," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We're showing continued momentum in our business with strong top line and adjusted earnings growth, and another quarter of very solid cash flow. Our business continued its product license and license update growth while we built revenue streams from new products - with strong performances from Citrix GoToMeeting and Citrix Access Gateway. The traction in our new products makes us confident in our strategic moves into adjacent access infrastructure markets. "Our second quarter release of Access Suite 4.0 is getting partners and customers excited, giving them compelling reasons for adopting, expanding, or standardizing on Citrix. "We kicked off the third quarter by launching Access Essentials, our new product designed to bring secure, remote access to small businesses, and by winning our second 'Global ISV of the Year Award' from Microsoft. "We head into the second half of the year executing well on our strategy, and we look forward to the closing of the NetScaler transaction to further enhance our market leadership and the competitiveness of the Citrix Access Platform."

Recognizing the advantages of deploying an Access Platform, the hospital chose the Citrix Access Suite for IT centralization, employee cost control and PC maintenance. Hamilton Health Sciences, one of Canada's largest multi-site teaching hospitals, selected the Citrix Access Platform for centralized application access and Citrix SmoothRoaming(TM) capabilities for its staff. With 3,500 seats of Citrix Presentation Server 3.0, the hospital has lowered its desktop costs and simplified application management for business-critical software such as Microsoft, Meditech and Peoplesoft. Once the roll-out is complete, 80 percent of all employees will use Citrix day-to-day for secure application access anytime, anywhere. Postini, the leading provider of e-mail security and management solutions, selected the Citrix Access Gateway to improve its VPN solution for secure remote access. Each week the company processes more than three billion e-mail messages for more than 5,000 companies around the globe - all while relying on a staff that works around the clock. The Access Gateway's self-installing client reduced support costs and provides an extra layer of security against threats by hiding the IP addresses of the remote network.

We consider these measures important indicators of our success. In addition, Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

"With this acquisition, we are extending our best access experience value to the entire range of Web-based applications, including enterprise, browser-based, XML Web services, and others," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "With the addition of the Citrix NetScaler Application Accelerator and Application Switch, the Citrix Access Platform can significantly optimize the customer's entire set of client/server, Web, desktop, or legacy enterprise resources. This reduces their IT costs through increased server scalability and availability, reduced back-end server loads, and increased network bandwidth efficiency, all while increasing user satisfaction and productivity." NetScaler, with approximately 200 employees, including research and development teams in Silicon Valley and India, will continue to operate from San Jose, Calif., as the Application Networking Group of Citrix. B.V. Jagadeesh, previously president and chief executive officer for NetScaler, will now report to Mark Templeton as group vice president and general manager. In early 2003, Citrix outlined a strategy to expand its coverage of the overall Access Infrastructure category by penetrating into adjacent high-growth markets such as collaboration and VPN. Since that time, Citrix has completed three acquisitions of best-of-breed companies. In 2004, Citrix acquired Expertcity, now the Online Group, moving the company into the real-time collaboration, desktop access and on-demand assistance market segments. Citrix also acquired Net6, now the Gateways Group, extending Citrix's reach in the SSL VPN (secure socket layer virtual private network) and IP (internet protocol) telephony market segments. NetScaler is the latest acquisition, adding innovative application networking technologies, including application acceleration & optimization; application traffic management, and application security. These technologies will allow end users to access enterprise resources faster; they'll improve the service levels that IT departments provide to the organizations they support; and they'll increase agility for businesses that run on the Citrix Access Platform.

GAAP Results Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $41.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share - which includes a $7.0 million expense charge for in-process research and development associated with the NetScaler acquisition - compared to net income of $38.4 million or $0.22 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

"Good momentum drove solid growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. "We saw strong performance and accelerating momentum from our new products, especially with our online services, gateways and application networking product lines. The results indicate that customers are finding our much broader portfolio of products and services to be the most compelling set of access infrastructure solutions on the market. "We just kicked off the fourth quarter with Citrix iForum, explaining our vision for access to a record number of customers and previewing new technologies and capabilities. The excitement and interest was high, and we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum generated at iForum in the coming quarters."

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
NetScaler, Inc.
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of NetScaler, Inc. as of June 30, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operation, stockholders' equity, and cash flow for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NetScaler, Inc. at June 30, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Description of Business
 
NetScaler, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on December 9, 1997, in the state of Delaware and provides networking systems that enable the fast and secure delivery of applications by integrating a unique suite of optimization, security and switching capabilities.
 
Since inception on December 9, 1997, the Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $76,764,560 through June 30, 2005, and expects to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis for the next year. Moreover, the Company expects to continue to incur significant sales, marketing, and research and development expenses. Management's plans for fiscal 2006 anticipate that product and maintenance revenues, together with the Company's existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balances and borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund the Company's cash requirements through at least June 30, 2006. However, management's plans for fiscal 2006 include certain discretionary spending that is predicated on the Company's ability to successfully market its products and generate the anticipated product and maintenance revenues during the year.
 
On June 1, 2005 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Citrix Systems, Inc. ("Citrix") and certain other parties including NCAR Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix ("NCAR"), and NCAR, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix ("LLC"), pursuant to which the Company will merge with NCAR (the "Merger") with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. The Merger will be followed by a roll-up merger of the Company and LLC with LLC continuing as the surviving entity after the roll-up merger. On August 15, 2005, the Merger was consummated, and Citrix acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company (see Note 8, Subsequent Events).
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries in India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary in India is the rupees, in Japan is Yen, and in the United Kingdom is the pound. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of the period and translates revenues and expenses using rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of operations.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
At June 30, 2005, cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less.
 
The Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained in checking and money market accounts. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates the fair value.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions.
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (continued)
 
A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of the Company's revenues and accounts receivable. The loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2005. No customer individually accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2005. The Company does not require collateral to support credit sales. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers. Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses and sales returns. The Company has not experienced significant losses to date.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, generally one to four years.
 
The Company periodically evaluates whether changes have occurred that would require revision of the remaining estimated useful life of the property and equipment or render them not recoverable. If such circumstances arise, the Company uses an estimate of the undiscounted value of expected future cash flows to determine whether the long-lived assets are impaired. Impairment, if any, is determined using discounted expected future cash flows.
 
Inventories
 
Inventories consist of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost (as determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
 
Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of revenues. Customer payments for shipping and handling are included in net revenues.
 
Advertising Expenses
 
The Company accounts for advertising costs as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expense for the year ended June 30, 2005, was approximately $321,000.
 
Research and Development Costs
 
Research and development expenditures primarily include personnel, related overhead, and materials expenses incurred to design, create, and test network infrastructure solutions. The Company expects to launch and market additional products within the coming 12 months. Software development costs incurred by the Company subsequent to the establishment of
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Research and Development Costs (continued)
 
technological feasibility which, based on the Company's product development process, is established upon completion of a working model, and prior to general product release, have been insignificant. Therefore, through June 30, 2005, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes product revenues from direct sales and sales made through resellers and other channel partners when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery and customer acceptance, where applicable, has occurred: the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Product revenue is deferred when the Company: (i) has to obtain customer acceptance, or (ii) has provided price protection and/or right of return on products unsold by resellers and channel partners, in which case, revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met.
 
The Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and fair value of all undelivered elements exists. Fair value for undelivered elements is based on normal pricing for those elements when sold separately and, for training and installation, is additionally measured by third party sales prices for comparable services. The revenue associated with customer support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of obligation. The revenue associated with service arrangements is primarily derived from fees for product installation and is recognized when the service is performed.
 
The Company's products carry a warranty that includes factory repair services or replacement parts as needed. The Company estimates expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and records the amount in the cost of sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. The Company estimates the expense based upon actual experience or for specific product warranty problems that are identified after shipment.
 
Accounts receivable is recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its accounts receivable allowance and sales return reserve by considering the accounts receivable aging, customer concentrations, the customer's expected ability to pay, and the collection history of each customer. The Company reviews any outstanding past due balances to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above. In addition, the Company maintains an additional allowance for doubtful accounts for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. The allowance for doubtful accounts represent management's best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowance or reserve in the future.
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for employee stock option grants using the intrinsic-value method and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative for the effect of accounting for such grants under the fair-value method. Accordingly, no stock compensation is recognized for stock options granted to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of shares of common stock for accounting purposes. The Company accounts for stock options granted to nonemployees under the fair-value method using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
 
Pro forma information regarding net loss is required as if the Company has accounted for its employee stock options under the fair-value method using the minimum-value option model. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the options' vesting period.
 
The following table illustrates the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair-value method:
 
 
The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2005 was $0.2825 per share.
 
In fiscal 2006 the Company must adopt FASB Statement No. 123R (SFAS 123R), which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, . Under SFAS 123R, all shared-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be expensed in the financial statements based on their fair value determined by applying a fair value measurement method. The adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.
"Share-Based Payment"
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which provides for the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 
For the period presented, the comprehensive loss is materially equal to the net loss and has been disclosed in the statements of stockholders' equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at June 30, 2005, relates to currency translation adjustments.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short period of time until their maturity.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 154, "" ("SFAS 154"). The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. SFAS 154 requires that a change in method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. Opinion 20 previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe this pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial results.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 151, " ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 clarifies treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage, specifying that such costs should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. The new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Companies must apply the standard prospectively. The Company does not believe the impact of this new standard will have a material effect on its financial statements or results of operations.

Property and equipment consist of the following:
 
 
3. Warranty Accrual
 
The Company generally sells its products with warranty for a period of 12 months from the date of shipment. A provision for the estimated cost of the warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under the warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is shipped. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
 
Changes in the Company's product liability, which is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, is as follows:
 
 
4. Financing Arrangements
 
On November 7, 2003 and subsequently amended, the Company entered into an accounts receivable purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with a financial institution. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company may sell certain of its receivables and customer purchase orders to the financial institution on a full recourse basis for an amount equal to 80% of the face amount of such purchased receivables and customer purchase orders, with the aggregate face amount of purchased receivables not to exceed $2.5 million and with an aggregate face amount of purchased customer purchase orders not to exceed $1.25 million. The aggregate amount of all outstanding advances may not exceed $2.0 million. The Purchase Agreement expires November 3, 2005 and from year to year thereafter until terminated by either party and payments are due monthly. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company granted the financial institution a security interest in substantially all of its tangible assets, other than intellectual property, in which the Company granted a negative pledge. The Purchase Agreement includes certain nonfinancial covenants with which the Company must comply. The Company is required to pay a monthly finance charge equal to prime plus 2.5% or prime plus 1.0%.
 
4. Financing Arrangements (continued)
 
Per annum of the average daily gross amount of unpaid purchased receivables and an administration fee equal to either 0.75% or 0.15% of the face amount of each purchased receivable, depending upon the Company's financial position. Since the Company's obligation to repay the financial institution is not conditioned on the collection of the related accounts receivable balances, the Company recorded the amounts due under this agreement in current liabilities. As of June 30, 2005, the Company had zero outstanding under the Purchase Agreement and the Company terminated the Purchase Agreement in June 2005.
 
In December 2003, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution that provided up to $3,000,000 under a revolving line of credit bearing interest at prime less 0.5% but in no case less than 3.5% that matures on December 31, 2005. The revolving line of credit was secured by a certificate of deposit to be maintained by the Company at the financial institution. This certificate of deposit was included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of June 30, 2005 the Company had no outstanding borrowing under the revolving line of credit and terminated the loan agreement in June 2005.
 
5. Stockholders' Equity
 
Preferred Stock
 
The Series 1 convertible preferred stock ("Series 1 preferred stock") and the Series 2 convertible preferred stock ("Series 2 preferred stock") have a liquidation preference of $1.10 and $5.6455 per share, respectively, plus all declared and unpaid dividends. The Series 1 preferred stock and Series 2 preferred stock are entitled to a noncumulative dividend at the rate of $0.088 and $0.452, per share per annum, respectively, when and if declared by the board of directors, in preference and priority to any common stock dividend.
 
The holders of the shares of Series 1 preferred stock and Series 2 preferred stock ("Series preferred stock") are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which such share may convert. The holders of Series preferred stock have the right at any time, at the option of the holder, to convert their shares into common stock at the exchange rate in effect at the time of conversion (currently 1-for-1), which is subject to appropriate adjustment for common stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions. Series 1 and 2 preferred stock automatically converts into common stock upon the closing of a qualifying initial public offering.
 
Stock Option/Rights Plan
 
The Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), under which employees, directors, and consultants may be granted Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs"), Stock Purchase Rights ("SPRs"), or Nonstatutory Stock Options ("NSOs") to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.
 
The Company is authorized to grant up to 6,692,000 shares of its common stock under the Plan and up to 90,911 shares of common stock outside of the Plan. The Plan permits ISOs to be
 
5. Stockholders' Equity (continued)
 
Stock Option/Rights Plan (continued)
 
granted to employees at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value on the date of the grant as determined by the board of directors. For employees who own stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price must not be less than 110%. The Plan permits NSOs to be granted at an exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value on the date of grant as determined by the board of directors. For service providers who, at the time of grant of such option, own stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price must not be less than 110%, and the term of the option shall be five years from the date of the grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. Options that expire (generally ten years from the date of grant) are canceled and returned to the Plan. The term of the Plan is ten years. Options may be granted with different vesting terms as determined by the board of directors. The options generally vest at 12.5% upon completion of six months of service and 1/48 per month thereafter.
 
The following is a summary of activity under the Plan and outside of the Plan:
 
 
The following table summarizes information regarding stock options outstanding at June 30, 2005:
 
 
Under the Plan, the Company may also grant stock purchase rights ("SPRs") either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards under the Plan. Exercise of these SPRs is made pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions established by the board of directors. These provisions give the Company the right to repurchase the shares at the original

purchase price. This right expires at a rate determined by the board of directors, generally at a rate of 12.5% after six months and 1/48 per month thereafter. The Company issued zero shares in the form of SPRs during the year ended June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2005, 109,166 shares of common stock, at a weighted-average exercise price of $0.1298, remained subject to repurchase under such restricted stock purchase agreements.
 
At June 30, 2005, there were 71,839 shares available for future grant under the Plan.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2005 the Company recorded stock compensation expenses of $142,924 related to stock options granted to consultants, service providers, and advisory board members. The value of the options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The unvested options have been and will continue to be marked-to-market until they vest using the estimated fair value at the end of each accounting period.
 
Warrants
 
The following warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding as of June 30, 2005:

6. Income Taxes
 
Income taxes of $48,042 for the year ended June 30, 2005, relate to current tax expense on income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes differs from the expected tax benefit amount computed by applying the statutory federal income rate of 34% to loss before taxes as follows as of June 30, 2005:
 
 
The components of net deferred tax assets are as follows as of June 30, 2005:
 
 
The valuation allowance increased by $5,352,000 and $4,500,000 during the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
 
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $71,112,000 and $38,366,000, respectively. The Company also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $617,000 and
 
6. Income Taxes (continued)
 
$634,000 respectively. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2006 if not utilized.
 
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
 
A subsidiary of the Company has a tax holiday valid for a period of 10 years from April 2002, under which 90% of the subsidiary's profits are not subject to tax. The subsidiary did not have taxable income for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 due to prior years' net operating losses carried forward.
 
7. Commitments and Contingencies
 
Operating Commitments
 
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year as of June 30, 2005, and other noncancelable commitments are as follows:
 
 
The Company's rental expense under operating leases for the year ended June 30, 2005, totaled $972,079.
 
In connection with the Company's operating lease for its corporate headquarters, the Company is required to provide a standby letter of credit of $65,320, through March 31, 2009, unless the lease is terminated earlier. The standby letter of credit is fully collateralized by way of a restricted cash certificate of deposit with a financial institution that the Company recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. Total interest earned in the restricted escrow accounts for the year ended June 30, 2005 was approximately $435.
 
7. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Licensing Termination Arrangement
 
In connection with the Company's technology licensing agreement with F5 Networks, Inc, ("F5") in the event of a change of control during the term of the licensing agreement that expires in March 2008, at F5's option, the Company will be obligated to pay the lesser of: (a) a royalty equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the sales revenue for products incorporating the licensed patent or (ii) $175 per unit; or (b) a lump sum royalty equal to $1,650,000 less the amount of any royalties paid to F5. (See Note 8, Subsequent Events)
 
Other
 
From time to time, the Company may be subject to claims, which arise in the normal course of business. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company's future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
 
8. Subsequent Events
 
On August 15, 2005, Citrix acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company in exchange for $140,100,000 in cash and approximately 6,600,000 shares of Citrix's common stock. Citrix also assumed certain options of the Company upon the closing of the transaction.
 
In accordance with the terms of the technology license agreement with F5 (see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies  Licensing Termination Arrangement), the Company made a termination payment of $1,275,000 in October 2005 in full satisfaction of its obligation.

On June 1, 2005, Citrix and NetScaler entered into a merger agreement that resulted in Citrix acquiring 100 percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NetScaler by means of a reverse triangular merger of NetScaler and NCAR Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix, with NCAR Acquisition Corporation ceasing to exist as a separate corporate entity and NetScaler continuing as the surviving corporation. The reverse triangular merger was consummated on August 15, 2005 and followed by a roll-up merger of NetScaler and NCAR, LLC, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Citrix, with NCAR, LLC continuing as the surviving entity of the roll-up merger. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total consideration for this transaction was approximately $302.4 million, comprised of approximately $140.0 million in cash, approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $155.3 million and direct transaction costs of approximately $6.1 million. The value of the common stock issued was based on 55% of the total purchase price divided by a fixed value per share of $24.83 as defined in the merger agreement. As of September 30, 2005, there were outstanding commitments for the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock related to the purchase consideration for NetScaler of approximately $0.5 million. The Company also assumed approximately $20.1 million in unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction that were accounted for in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44, and were recorded as deferred compensation. The options assumed had an excess of fair value over intrinsic value of approximately $0.5 million and is reflected in the total consideration for the transaction.
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 2)
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price was allocated to NetScaler's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the merger. Based on the preliminary third party valuation and other factors as described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements, the preliminary estimated purchase price was allocated as follows (in thousands):
 
 
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was based upon a preliminary valuation and the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change upon the finalization of the
 
valuation. The purchase price allocation is not finalized primarily due to IPR&D.
 
Of the total estimated purchase price, a preliminary estimate of approximately $13.0 million was allocated to net tangible assets acquired. Net tangible assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts, which management believes approximated fair value, except for adjustments to deferred revenue, deferred tax assets and a pre-acquisition royalty liability. Deferred revenues were reduced by $2.8 million in the pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet, to adjust deferred revenue to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the support and maintenance services, product delivery and installation obligations under NetScaler's existing contracts. Deferred tax assets include the tax effects of fair value adjustments related to NetScaler's net tangible and intangible assets and the pre-acquisition royalty liability which relates to a termination payment made in accordance with the terms of the technology license agreement with F5 is recorded at the amount paid subsequent to the acquisition.
 
Approximately $70.2 million was allocated to identifiable amortizable intangible assets acquired. Core technology is comprised of products that have reached technological feasibility, which includes most of NetScaler's technology, principally NetScaler's application acceleration networking product line. The remainder of amortizable intangible assets is associated with customer relationships, trade names and covenants not to compete. The amortization related to the amortizable intangible assets is reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated income statements.
 
Of the total estimated purchase price, approximately $212.2 million was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually. In the event that the Company determines that the value of the goodwill has become impaired, an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment will be incurred in the quarter in which such determination was made.
 
Of the total estimated purchase price, approximately $7.0 million was allocated to IPR&D and was charged to expense upon completion of the merger. The IPR&D amount is primarily related to NetScaler projects related to development in multiple product areas that have not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses.
 
 
Effective August 9, 2005, the Company entered into a senior revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") with a group of financial institutions, to, among other things, fund a portion of the cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of the outstanding shares of capital stock of NetScaler. The Credit Facility provides for a five year revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to continued covenant compliance. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on the level of the Company's total debt and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). In addition, the Company is required to pay
 
an annual facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% based on the aggregate amount available under the Credit Facility and the level of the Company's total debt and its adjusted EBITDA. The Company repaid all initial borrowings under the Credit Facility on September 29, 2005.
 
 
Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect purchase accounting adjustments and borrowings as if the merger and the borrowings occurred on June 30, 2005 and to present the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated income statements for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
 
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements are as follows:

We consider these measures important indicators of our success. Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. In addition, we believe that it is useful to investors to review information concerning Citrix's results of operations on both a GAAP basis and a non-GAAP basis that excludes stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123(R) amongst others as it relates to 2006 forward-looking guidance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports First Quarter Earnings Results; Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 29%; GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.24 Versus $0.22 Over Comparable Period Last Year FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2006-- Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.33 Versus $0.24 Over Comparable Period Last Year Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ended March 31, 2006. Financial Results In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $260 million, compared to $202 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 29 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $45 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $39 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the first quarter of 2006 increased 45 percent to $61 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $42 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and the effects of stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation impacted operating income by approximately $12 million. "Our first quarter results were excellent," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We had strong top line and earnings growth, and another quarter of very solid cash flow. Our business continued its product license and license update growth, especially in Presentation Server licenses as our customers continued to upgrade to version 4. "The results indicate that customers are finding our broad portfolio of products and services to be the most compelling set of access infrastructure solutions on the market." Q1 Financial Highlights In reviewing the first quarter results of 2006, compared to the first quarter of 2005: -- Revenue grew in the America's region by 27 percent; the EMEA region by 26 percent, and the Pacific region by 18 percent; -- Product license revenue increased 27 percent; -- Online services contributed $32 million of revenue, up 55 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 22 percent; and, -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 42 percent.

This brings total twelve month trailing cash flow from operations to $316 million. Financial Outlook for Second Fiscal Quarter 2006 Citrix management offers the following guidance for the second fiscal quarter 2006 ending June 30, 2006: -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $259 million to $265 million, compared to $211 million in the second quarter of 2005. -- GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.26, compared to $0.16 in the second quarter of 2005.

We consider these measures important indicators of our success. In addition, Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Citrix Systems, Inc. 2006 Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") and established bonus awards that may be earned for fiscal year 2006 under the Bonus Plan by the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Senior Vice President, Corporate Sales and Services; General Counsel and Corporate Vice President, Human Resources; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Vice President, EMEA Sales and General Manager; and Group Vice President and General Manager, Online Group; and other executive officers approved for participation in the Bonus Plan by the Compensation Committee (each a "Participant"). The Bonus Plan establishes target bonus levels for each Participant expressed as a percentage of each Participant's base salary. The 2006 bonuses will be paid based on the achievement of certain company-wide, geographic segment and/or individual goals. The actual bonus payments may be less than or greater than the target bonus amounts depending on whether and the extent to which the goals upon which such bonuses are based are achieved. Except under certain circumstances, bonus awards are payable following the conclusion of fiscal year 2006. The Compensation Committee and/or the Board of Directors retain the right to amend, alter or terminate the Bonus Plan at any time.
The Bonus Plan is filed with this report as .

The purpose of the Citrix Systems, Inc. 2006 Executive Bonus Plan ("Plan") is to provide to executive officers of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") competitive compensation opportunities that are aligned with and promote the overall financial objectives of the Company and its shareholders. In addition to base salary and long-term equity awards, this will be accomplished through incentives payable in the form of cash bonuses designed to reward executives for the financial and operational success of the Company. This Plan does not govern the Company's base salary and long-term equity awards compensation practices.

Other individuals may become Plan Participants during a fiscal year ("New Participants") provided such an individual is: (1) an executive of the Company; (2) recommended for participation by the President & CEO; and (3) approved for participation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee").
 
The Plan will be administered by the President & CEO and the Compensation Committee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Participants will be eligible to participate in this Plan upon the recommendation of the President & CEO and approval by the Compensation Committee. A New Participant's bonus opportunity will be prorated based on the number of full and partial months remaining in the performance period at the time Plan participation is approved. New Participants approved for the Plan may be eligible to receive a bonus (prorated based on the number of full and partial months remaining in the performance period) for the achievement of individual performance measures, as recommended by the President & CEO and approved by the Compensation Committee.
 
For all Participants other than the Group Vice President and General Manager, Online Group and VP, EMEA Sales and General Manager, bonus awards under this Plan will be calculated based on the following financial components for purposes of performance measurement and weightings:

For purposes of this Plan, Corporate Operating Income and EPS shall be calculated on an adjusted basis that specifically excludes amortization of intangible assets, write-offs of in-process research and development, charges associated with the expensing of equity-based compensation and other adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee.
Financial components and weightings will be reviewed periodically throughout the year to ensure continued alignment with the Company's business strategy and objectives. Upon the recommendation of the President & CEO and approval of the Compensation Committee, the financial components and weightings may be adjusted at such time to reflect changes in business priorities.
 
 
In the event of the under-achievement by the Company of the Financial Targets, or segment financial target (as the case may be), for each financial component category but subject to the requirements of subsections IV.C (1) and (2) above, bonus awards will be adjusted downwards from the Plan Participant's target bonus award as follows:
For all Participants other than the Group Vice President and General Manager, Online Group and the VP, EMEA Sales and General Manager:
 
For the Group Vice President and General Manager, Online Group:
 
For the VP, EMEA Sales and General Manager:

Subject to approval by the Compensation Committee, the balance of all bonus awards will be paid in cash no later than the first quarter following the conclusion of the fiscal year to which the award relates.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Second Quarter Earnings Results; Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 30%; GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.24 Versus $0.16 Over Comparable Period Last Year FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2006-- Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.33 Versus $0.27 Over Comparable Period Last Year Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 ended June 30, 2006. Financial Results In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $275 million, compared to $211 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 30 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $46 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $28 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the second quarter of 2006 increased 34 percent to $64 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $48 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, adjusted results for the second quarter of 2005 exclude a net tax provision recorded in anticipation of repatriating certain foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). "I'm pleased with our second quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We saw across-the-board strength in our product portfolio and in our geographic segments. We are well positioned for the second half of 2006 as we continue to drive our access infrastructure strategy." Q2 Financial Highlights In reviewing the second quarter results of 2006, compared to the second quarter of 2005: -- Revenue grew in the America's region by 36 percent, the EMEA region by 20 percent and the Pacific region by 24 percent; -- Product license revenue increased 28 percent; -- Online services contributed $35 million of revenue, up 47 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 24 percent; and -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 52 percent. Other financial highlights included: -- Deferred revenue totaled $311 million, compared to $243 million on June 30, 2005; -- Operating margin was 19 percent for the quarter; non-GAAP operating margin was 27 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to those items; and -- Cash flow from operations was $60 million, compared to $65 million in the second quarter of 2005. This brings total twelve month trailing cash flow from operations to approximately $310 million. Financial Outlook for Third Fiscal Quarter 2006 Citrix management offers the following guidance for the third fiscal quarter 2006 ending September 30, 2006: -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $280 million, compared to $227 million in the third quarter of 2005. -- GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.26, compared to $0.23 in the third quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.34, excluding $0.03 related to the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and $0.05 to $0.06 related to the effects of stock-based compensation expenses. This compares to $0.29 in the same quarter of the previous year, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write off of in-process research and development and the tax effects related to those items. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2006 Citrix management offers the following guidance for the fiscal year 2006 ending December 31, 2006: -- The company expects net revenue to be in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.120 billion, compared to $909 million in fiscal year 2005. -- The company expects GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.05, compared to $0.93 in fiscal year 2005. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.39, excluding $0.14 related to the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and $0.20 to $0.22 related to the effects of stock-based compensation expenses. This compares to $1.17 for fiscal year 2005, when adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in process research and development, the related tax effects of these items and the tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

We consider these measures important indicators of our success. In addition, Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the Company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Item 1.01. Entry into Material Definitive Agreements.
On September 27, 2006, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), entered into an amendment and restatement of its five-year $100 million credit facility (as so amended and restated, the "Credit Agreement"), among Citrix Systems International GmbH as co-borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and UK Security Trustee (together with the other lenders, the "Lenders"). Citrix's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by several of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement amended and restated Citrix's previously existing secured credit facility with the Lenders that was dated as of August 9, 2005 and was set to expire August 9, 2010. Subject to continued covenant compliance, the Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to $100 million (of which up to $25 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to $15 million may be used for the making of swing loans by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) and will expire on September 27, 2011. Citrix may from time to time increase the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $175 million. The borrowings under the credit facility bear interest and fees as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Under the Credit Agreement, Citrix must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The primary non-financial covenants limit Citrix's ability to pay dividends, conduct certain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments and loans, incur future indebtedness or liens, alter Citrix's capital structure, or sell stock or assets. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money and bankruptcy-related defaults. The Lenders are entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the events of default.
The Lenders and/or their affiliates have provided and may continue to provide commercial banking, investment management and other services to Citrix, its affiliates and employees, for which they receive customary fees and commissions.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description above is a summary of the Credit Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Credit Agreement.

Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
Reimbursement
provided
mutatis
mutandis
(f) . The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any
Obligations Absolute
 
Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; that the foregoing, including clauses (i) through (iv), shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or (ii) such Issuing Bank's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit issued by it after presentation to it of a request that it has determined strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
(g) . Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
(h) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest
provided
 
(i) . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank (if any, it being understood that a successor Issuing Bank shall not be required if there is more than one Issuing Bank obligated to issue additional Letters of Credit at the time). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of an Issuing Bank
(j) . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. On the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, whether or not an Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate LC Exposure with respect to Letters of Credit with an expiration date later than five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, plus any accrued unpaid interest thereon. Such deposits shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made in Cash Equivalents as directed by the Borrower and at the Borrower's risk and expense; that at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of
Cash Collateralization
provided
provided
 
Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of an approaching Maturity Date, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Letters of Credit have expired.
SECTION 2.07. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City (or, in the case of the Subsidiary Borrower, in such other location as may be designated by the Administrative Agent) and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings
provided
provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.08. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
 
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
SECTION 2.09. . (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Increase of Commitments
(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
provided
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent, subject to the provisions of Section 2.09(d). Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
(d) At any time prior to a second reduction of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09(b), the Borrower may, from time to time, at its option, seek to increase the total Commitments by up to an aggregate amount of $75,000,000 (resulting in maximum total Commitments of $175,000,000) upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such increase and shall be delivered at a time when no Default has occurred and is continuing. After delivery of such notice, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, in consultation with the Administrative Agent, may offer the increase (which may be declined by any Lender in its sole discretion) in the total Commitments on either a ratable basis to the Lenders or on a non pro-rata basis to one or more Lenders and/or to other Lenders or entities reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. No increase in the total Commitments shall become effective until the existing or new Lenders extending such incremental Commitment amount and the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a document in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which any such existing Lender states the amount of its Commitment increase, any such new Lender states its Commitment amount and agrees to assume and accept the obligations and rights of a Lender hereunder and the Borrower accepts such incremental Commitments. The Lenders (new or existing) shall accept an assignment from the existing Lenders, and the existing Lenders shall make an assignment to the new or existing Lender accepting a new or increased Commitment, of a direct or participation interest in each then outstanding Loan and Letter of Credit such that, after giving effect thereto, all Revolving Credit Exposure hereunder is held ratably by the Lenders in proportion to their respective Commitments. Assignments pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made in exchange for
 
the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid interest and commitment and letter of credit fees. The Borrower shall make any payments under Section 2.16 resulting from such assignments. Any such increase of the total Commitments shall be subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower of such supplemental opinions, resolutions, certificates and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
SECTION 2.10. . (a) Each Applicable Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each of its Revolving Loans on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least three Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
provided
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima
facie
provided
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
SECTION 2.11. . (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
provided
SECTION 2.12. . (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be invoiced and payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.

of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be invoiced and payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by either of the Borrowers hereunder is not paid when due and invoiced, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(d) For the purposes of the laws of Switzerland, and without duplication of Section 2.17, all payments under this Agreement have been computed as minimum payments net of any mandatory reduction on account of Swiss withholding taxes to the extent such withholding taxes constitute Indemnified Taxes.

SECTION 2.14. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
provided
SECTION 2.15. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank (without duplication of any amounts paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17), as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or an Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or such Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 225 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 225-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16. . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
Break Funding Payments
 
hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any loss, cost or expense incurred more than 225 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the loss, cost or expense and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.
provided
SECTION 2.17. . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of either of the Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if either of the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Applicable Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes
provided
(b) In addition, the Applicable Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Applicable Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Applicable Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section but excluding Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable) and
 
any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Applicable Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) (i) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Applicable Borrower is organized, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. The Borrower agrees to furnish to each Lender (other than a Foreign Lender that is not a Qualifying Lender) such certificates or other documents as shall be necessary to claim a refund or reduction of Swiss withholding taxes.
(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, each Foreign Lender with respect to Loans to the Borrower, shall deliver to the Borrower, with copies to the Administrative Agent, two copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption from the withholding of U.S. federal income tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest," a certificate representing that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, (B) a ten-percent shareholder of the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) or (C) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in all cases properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding of U.S. federal income tax on all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Such forms shall be delivered by each such Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement. In addition, each such Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it may do so under applicable law, deliver such forms immediately prior to the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Each such Foreign Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
 
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by one of the Borrowers or with respect to which one of the Borrowers has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Applicable Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Applicable Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that the Applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Applicable Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to either of the Borrowers or any other Person.
provided
SECTION 2.18. . (a) Each of the Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans
 
or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by either of the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each of the Borrowers consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Applicable Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Applicable Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if either of the Borrowers is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
 
Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Borrower or to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing, designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such filing, designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if either of the Borrowers is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, the Borrower reasonably expects that such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments under Section 2.15 or 2.17 in the future or a reduced risk of such compensation or payments being claimed or required in the future. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01. . Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent that such concept applies) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

Properties
(b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
SECTION 3.06. . (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) which could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that, as of the Effective Date, involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

SECTION 4.02. . The obligation of each Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of the Issuing Bank to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:
Each Credit Event
(a) The representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable (except any such representation or warranty that expressly relates to or is made expressly as of a specific earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct with respect to or as of such specific earlier date).
(b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Until the Commitments have expired or been terminated and the principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the write-off of in-process research and development. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors: -- The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. -- Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. -- Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact because such charges are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Results Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 19% Annual Revenue Growth of 25% FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Preliminary Financial Results In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $321 million, compared to $269 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 19 percent revenue growth. Annual revenues for 2006 were $1.134 billion, compared to $909 million in the previous year, a 25 percent increase. GAAP Results Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $59 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Annual net income for 2006 was $196 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $166 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by nine percent to $73 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $67 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, and the tax effects related to those items. Annual non-GAAP net income for 2006 was $262 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to $209 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in 2005. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in-process research and development (IPR&D) and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, in 2005 non-GAAP net income also excludes the tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). "A strong finish to another very strong year of growth," said Mark Templeton, Citrix president and chief executive officer. "We've built excellent momentum in each of our businesses, and I believe we're entering 2007 with the best product pipeline, channel partnerships, and brand strength we've ever had. We're well-positioned for continued growth as we lead the formation of the application delivery market." Stock Option Review During the quarter, the Audit Committee of the company's Board of Directors began a voluntary review of the company's historical stock option granting practices and the related accounting. This voluntary review was initiated in light of news about the option practices of numerous companies across several industries and not in response to any governmental investigation, whistleblower complaint or inquiries from media organizations. The Audit Committee has engaged independent outside legal counsel to conduct the review. Because this review is ongoing, the company has not yet determined if it will need to record any non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants, making today's results preliminary. Specifically, the company does not know whether any such non-cash compensation charges would affect the preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 or the full year 2006 being announced today, or would be deemed material and require the company to restate previously issued financial statements or would require an adjustment to the retained earnings balance on the company's balance sheet. If any such charges are required, Citrix will also need to determine the impact of this matter on its system of internal controls.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in-process research and development and for 2005, a non-recurring tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors: -- The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. -- Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. -- Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. -- The company considers the 2005 tax provision related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the AJCA as non-recurring as it is not reasonably likely to recur within two years and there was no similar provision in the prior two years. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of this tax provision provides investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

(a) As previously announced, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") is conducting a voluntary review of the Company's historical stock option granting practices from 1996 to present and the related accounting.
On March 14, 2007, after discussion with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors and its independent registered accounting firm, the Company concluded that it had used incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes for certain historical stock option grants issued during the period under review and that it will restate the financial statements described below. The Company has determined that non-cash stock-based compensation expenses should have been recorded with respect to those stock option grants and recognized over the vesting period of those options, and that the amount of such additional expenses is material.
The Company's previously issued financial statements and reports thereon for the fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005, which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with respect to each of those fiscal years and the financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2006 and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to such periods should no longer be relied upon. In addition, the restatement will materially affect financial statements for fiscal years prior to 2003, and the Company will reflect those adjustments as part of the opening balances in the financial statements for the restated periods. The financial statements for fiscal years prior to 2003 should also no longer be relied upon.
Because the Audit Committee's review is ongoing, the Company has not determined the final aggregate amount of additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense or the amount of such expense to be recorded in any specific prior period or in any future period. The Company has also not identified all stock option grants for which the accounting measurement dates may have been incorrectly determined. In addition, the Company expects that the expenses arising from the voluntary review, the anticipated restatements and related activities, which will be recorded in the periods incurred, will be significant.
The Company currently expects to file its restated financial statements and to become current in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as practicable following the completion of the Audit Committee's review.
 
Citrix issued a press release on March 14, 2007 a copy of which is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

 Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today provided an update on its independent, voluntary stock option review.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  March 14, 2007
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Citrix Systems, Inc. has reached a determination that incorrect measurement dates were used to account for certain historical stock option grants during the period under review. The Company expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses. Accordingly, on March 14, 2007, the Company's Audit Committee, after consultation with the Company's management, Board of Directors and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, determined that the Company's previously issued financial statements and reports thereon, earnings releases and other historical financial information and related disclosures should no longer be relied upon. Consequently, the Company will restate previously issued financial statements as necessary.
The Audit Committee has not completed its investigation or reached any final conclusion. However, it has found nothing to date that would cause it to conclude that there was intentional wrongdoing by a current executive of the Company.
The Company also reported that it will further delay the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 beyond March 16, 2007.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press release dated April 25, 2007 of Citrix Systems, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports First Quarter Revenues of $308 Million Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 18% FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported quarterly revenues and other financial information for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended March 31, 2007. Operational Highlights In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, Citrix achieved revenue of $308 million, compared to $260 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, representing 18 percent revenue growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, total cost of revenues and operating expenses - which include cost of product license and services revenues, research and development, sales, marketing and support, general and administrative, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related charges was approximately $250 million. This amount includes amortization expense of approximately $10 million, a $1 million write-off of in-process research and development related to the closing of the Ardence acquisition and approximately $6 million in accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the voluntary stock option review. Other income was approximately $12 million. Due to the ongoing voluntary stock option review, costs and expenses reported today do not include any stock-based compensation expense. "I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We generated great momentum in our product lines, and are off to a solid start to 2007. "We saw good pipeline growth for Presentation Server Platinum Edition due to the positioning, pricing and packaging moves we made, as well as the positive influence EdgeSight has on upgrades. I am also pleased with the growth in our application networking product line." Stock Option Review Update In the quarter ended December 31, 2006, the Audit Committee of the company's Board of Directors began a voluntary review of the company's historical stock option granting practices and the related accounting for the years 1996 through 2006. This voluntary review was initiated in light of news about the option practices of numerous companies across several industries and not in response to any governmental investigation, whistleblower complaint, stockholder lawsuit or inquiries from media organizations. The Audit Committee engaged independent outside legal counsel to conduct the review. The Audit Committee has nearly completed its review and has reached a determination that incorrect measurement dates were used to account for certain historical stock option grants during the years under review. Citrix expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and the restatement of previously issued financial statements. Today Citrix is not providing full GAAP or non-GAAP financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 due to the ongoing stock option review. Because this review is ongoing, the Audit Committee has not reached any final conclusions. However, it has found nothing to date that would cause it to conclude that there was intentional wrongdoing by a current executive of the company. Citrix intends to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 containing the required restatements of its financial statements as soon as practicable after the voluntary review is completed. The company will release full first quarter financial statements on a press release at that time. Q1 Financial Highlights In reviewing the first quarter of 2007, compared to the first quarter of 2006: -- Product license revenue increased 7 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 20 percent; -- Online services contributed $47 million of revenue, up 49 percent; -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 28 percent; -- Deferred revenue totaled $376 million, compared to $292 million at March 31, 2006; and -- There was no stock repurchase activity during the quarter due to the ongoing stock option review. Citrix has over $330 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization. Financial Outlook for Second Fiscal Quarter 2007 Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during the second fiscal quarter 2007 ending June 30, 2007. As a result of the voluntary stock option review, Citrix is not providing earnings per share guidance at this time. -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $317 million to $324 million, compared to $275 million in the second quarter of 2006. -- Total cost of revenues and operating expenses in the second quarter are expected to be in a range of approximately $254 million to $258 million. Included in the second quarter outlook are amortization expenses in the range of $10 million to $11 million and $3 million for accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the ongoing stock option review. This estimate of second quarter spending does not take into account any stock-based compensation expense or other charges likely to result from the voluntary stock option review. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2007 Citrix management expects to achieve the following results for the fiscal year 2007: -- For fiscal year 2007, the company expects net revenue to be in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion, compared to $1.13 billion in fiscal year 2006. The company expects total cost of revenues and operating expenses to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion. Included in the fiscal year 2007 outlook is amortization expenses in the range of $41 million to $42 million, a $1 million write-off of in-process research and development related to the closing of the Ardence acquisition and $9 million for accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the ongoing stock option review. This estimate of fiscal year 2007 spending does not take into account any stock-based compensation expense or other charges likely to result from the voluntary stock option review. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Company, Product and Alliance Highlights During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, Citrix: -- Introduced a new version of its flagship product - Citrix Presentation Server(TM) 4.5 redefining state-of-the-art application delivery for Windows; -- Introduced a new Citrix Access Gateway(TM) appliance that supports more than 10,000 users, which is more than double what other market leading products offer; -- Introduced a new version of Citrix(R) GoToMyPC(R) 6.0, the market-leading remote access service, with a new sound capability allowing users to listen to music, voice-mail and system sounds on their PC from anywhere; -- Completed the acquisition of Ardence Inc. bringing on-demand provisioning to its application delivery infrastructure; -- Introduced version 7.1 of Ardence(R) RTX(R), a market-leading real-time software solution, with significant enhancements including support for IPv6 and greater performance and reliability; -- Acquired Aurema Pty Ltd., which improved application delivery for Windows-based applications by boosting workload management capabilities; -- Opened a new Silicon Valley headquarters in Santa Clara, California; -- Won the 2007 SC Magazine Reader Trust Award for IPSec/SSL VPN Solution; -- Placed in the SSL VPN Leader Quadrant by Gartner, Inc., and soared to No. 2 in worldwide SSL VPN market share according to Infonetics Research Inc.; -- Won a "Top 10 Product of the Year Award" from Small Business Technology for Citrix(R) GoToWebinar(TM), and an "Excellence in Technology Award" from Small Business Computing; and -- Honored with INTERNET TELEPHONY(R) Magazine's 2006 Product of the Year Award for Citrix Application Gateway(TM).

The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each potential non-GAAP financial measure used above and under the caption Operational Highlights and a reconciliation of the differences between each such potential non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided by Citrix at this time because the ongoing voluntary stock option review, among other things, makes such information with respect to stock-based compensation expense unavailable. Until the completion of the voluntary stock option review, Citrix intends to use cost of revenues and operating expenses as presented above for internal reporting and forecasting purposes and to evaluate the company's performance. Citrix has provided cost of revenues and operating expenses as presented above because it believes that these financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts during the pendency of the Audit Committee's voluntary stock option review. Citrix will release GAAP cost of revenues and operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007 upon completion of the stock option review.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Announces Findings of Voluntary Stock Option Review Citrix Granted Extension by NASDAQ FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 13, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors reported its findings from the voluntary review into Citrix's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting that has been ongoing for approximately the last seven months. This comprehensive review was conducted by the Audit Committee, which was assisted by both independent outside legal counsel and forensic accounting consultants. The review covered option grants made to employees, executives and directors during the period from January 1996 to December 2006, consisting of approximately 200 grant dates representing over 27,000 individual option grants. The review included an extensive examination of the Company's stock option granting practices, accounting policies, related accounting records, supporting documentation and electronic data, including e-mail, as well as over 50 interviews with current and former officers, employees, members of the Board of Directors and outside professionals. The Audit Committee concluded that from 1996 until mid-1998, the Company followed processes and procedures that likely led to the setting of grant dates retrospectively for many stock options granted to employees and executives. The Audit Committee found that none of the Company's current executives were responsible for retrospective selection of grant dates during this period. For grants from 1996 through late-2003, the accounting issues corrected in the restatement were caused mainly by errors such as delays in obtaining written approvals of grants, incomplete adherence to grant procedures, and process deficiencies in the grant procedures. Many of the errors during this period resulted from delays in obtaining written approval of grants for which the grant dates were selected in advance. After late 2003, there were only a few issues, caused by administrative errors. After completion of its investigation, the Audit Committee concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current executive of the company in connection with the Company's stock option grants and procedures during the period under review (1996-2006). As a result of the voluntary review, and as previously announced by the Company, the Company intends to restate its previously issued financial statements and reports thereon for the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and for the interim quarterly periods for 2005 and 2006 to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised. The Company intends to submit a request for consultation on certain interpretive issues to the Office of Chief Accountant ("OCA") of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of the pending OCA consultation, the Company has not yet determined conclusively the amount of additional non-cash compensation expense to be recorded or the resulting tax impact. As a result of the information collected by the Audit Committee during its review, management has proposed recommendations for further enhancement of the Company's equity-based compensation granting practices. Today the Company also announced that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, subject to certain conditions, has granted the Company an extension of time until July 30, 2007 in which to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, all required restated and other financial statements for previous periods, and to otherwise meet all necessary listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. During the extension period, the Company's common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. About Citrix Citrix Systems, Inc.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Citrix Reports Record Second Quarter Revenue of $334 Million Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 21% Year-over-year Product License Growth of 16% FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported quarterly revenues and other financial information for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 ended June 30, 2007. Operational Highlights In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Citrix achieved revenue of $334 million, compared to $275 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, representing 21 percent revenue growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, total cost of revenues and operating expenses - which include cost of product license and services revenues, research and development, sales, marketing and support, general and administrative and amortization of intangible assets was approximately $268 million. This amount includes amortization expense of approximately $10 million and approximately $3 million in accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the voluntary stock option review. Other income was approximately $12.5 million. Due to the voluntary stock option review, costs and expenses reported today do not include any stock-based compensation expense. "I'm very pleased with our second quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We capped a great first half of the year with record $334 million of revenue in the second quarter, and $642 million for the first half -- growing 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively. "The combination of our results, strong market traction, and the relevancy of Application Delivery Infrastructure to our customers, fuels my optimism for the rest of the year." Stock Option Review On June 13, 2007, the company announced the findings of its voluntary review into Citrix's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting. As a result of the voluntary review and as previously announced, the company intends to restate its issued financial statements and reports for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and for the interim quarterly periods for 2005 and 2006 to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised. After completion of its investigation, the Audit Committee of the company's Board of Directors concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current executive of the company in connection with the company's stock option grants and procedures during the period under review (1996-2006). The company also announced its decision to consult with the Office of Chief Accountant ("OCA") of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of the pending OCA consultation, the company has not yet determined conclusively the amount of additional non-cash compensation expense to be recorded or the resulting tax impact and today is not providing full GAAP or non-GAAP financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Citrix intends to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 containing the required restatements of its financial statements as soon as practicable after the completion of the OCA consultation process. The company will release full second quarter financial statements in a press release at that time. Today the company also announced that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, subject to certain conditions, has granted the company a further extension of time until August 30, 2007 in which to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, all required restated and other financial statements for previous periods, and to otherwise meet all necessary listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. During the extension period, the company's common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Q2 Financial Highlights In reviewing the second quarter of 2007, compared to the second quarter of 2006: -- Product license revenue increased 16 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 18 percent; -- Online services contributed $52 million of revenue, up 47 percent; -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 22 percent; -- Deferred revenue totaled $395 million, compared to $311 million on June 30, 2006; -- There was no stock repurchase activity during the quarter due to the voluntary stock option review. Citrix has over $330 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization. Financial Outlook for Third Fiscal Quarter 2007 Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during the third fiscal quarter 2007 ending September 30, 2007. As a result of the voluntary stock option review, Citrix is not providing earnings per share guidance at this time. -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $335 million to $343 million, compared to $278 million in the third quarter of 2006. -- Total cost of revenues and operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to be in a range of approximately $266 million to $272 million. Included in the third quarter outlook are amortization expenses in the range of $10 million to $11 million and $2 million for accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the voluntary stock option review. This estimate of third quarter spending does not take into account any stock-based compensation expense or other charges likely to result from the voluntary stock option review. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2007 Citrix management expects to achieve the following results for the fiscal year 2007: -- For fiscal year 2007, the company expects net revenue to be in the range of $1.340 billion to $1.360 billion, compared to $1.13 billion in fiscal year 2006. The company expects total cost of revenues and operating expenses to be in the range of $1.066 billion to $1.076 billion. Included in the fiscal year 2007 outlook is amortization expenses in the range of $41 million to $42 million, a $1.2 million write-off of in-process research and development related to the closing of the Ardence acquisition and $11 million for accounting, legal, and tax fees related to the voluntary stock option review. This estimate of fiscal year 2007 spending does not take into account any stock-based compensation expense or other charges likely to result from the voluntary stock option review. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each potential non-GAAP financial measure used above and under the caption Operational Highlights and a reconciliation of the differences between each such potential non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided by Citrix at this time because the voluntary stock option review, among other things, makes such information with respect to stock-based compensation expense unavailable. Until the completion of the voluntary stock option review, Citrix intends to use cost of revenues and operating expenses as presented above for internal reporting and forecasting purposes and to evaluate the company's performance. Citrix has provided cost of revenues and operating expenses as presented above because it believes that these financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts during the pendency of the Audit Committee's voluntary stock option review. Citrix will release GAAP cost of revenues and operating expenses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 upon completion of the company's consultation with the OCA.

Section 3--Securities and Trading Markets Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, as expected, it received on August 9, 2007, an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination notice stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with Nasdaq for continued listing. As anticipated, the letter was issued in accordance with Nasdaq's procedures as a result of the delayed filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. As previously disclosed, Nasdaq initially informed the Company on March 15, 2007 that its securities would be delisted due to the Company's delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 unless the Company requested a hearing in accordance with applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Company subsequently requested and was granted a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. Prior to the Panel rendering its decision, on May 11, 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination Notice as a result of the Company's delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Currently, the Panel has rendered decisions granting the Company's request for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to, among other things, the Company being current in its public filings prior to August 30, 2007. The Company intends to make a submission to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council to address the delayed filing of its second quarter Form 10-Q. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council will grant the Company's request for continued listing. On June 13, 2007, the Company announced the findings of the voluntary investigation of its historical stock option granting practices and related accounting conducted by the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. As a result of the voluntary investigation, and as previously announced by the Company, the Company intends to restate its previously issued financial statements and reports thereon for the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and for the interim quarterly periods for 2005 and 2006 to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised. Further, as previously announced, the Company intends to shortly submit a request for consultation on certain interpretive issues to the Office of Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "OCA"). Because of the pending OCA consultation, the Company has not yet become current in its public filings or determined conclusively the amount of additional non-cash compensation expense to be recorded as a result of the investigation of the Company's historical stock option granting practices or the resulting tax impact. The Company intends to file its annual and quarterly reports as soon as practicable after completion of the OCA consultation process. Section 7--Regulation FD Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

Section 1--Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On August 14, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix ("Merger Sub"), and PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix ("LLC"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") with XenSource, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("XenSource"), and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Citrix proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of XenSource by means of a merger of XenSource and Merger Sub, with XenSource continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). Promptly following the Merger, XenSource will merge with and into the LLC, with the LLC to be the final surviving entity. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration pursuant to the Merger is approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock, which includes the assumption of approximately $107 million in unvested stock options upon the closing of the Merger. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the stock consideration is based on a per share value for Citrix's common stock of $36.18. This transaction has been approved by the board of directors of both Citrix and XenSource. The parties to the Merger Agreement currently anticipate completing this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2007, subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory review and approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, approval by the stockholders of XenSource, Citrix becoming current in its periodic reporting obligations and other customary conditions. The Sevin Rosen funds, a venture capital firm, is a stockholder in XenSource. Steve Dow, a director of Citrix, is a general partner of the Sevin Rosen funds and does not directly hold any interest in XenSource. Although the Sevin Rosen funds are represented on the Board of Directors of XenSource, Mr. Dow is not a director of XenSource. The Merger will provide a return to all general partners of the firm, including Mr. Dow. Subject to certain assumptions, Citrix currently estimates that the potential allocation to Mr. Dow through the general partner entities of the Sevin Rosen funds related to the Merger is approximately $1.9 million. Mr. Dow has been on the Citrix Board of Directors since 1989 and currently owns 262,352 shares of Citrix common stock. Mr. Dow did not attend the meeting at which the Citrix Board approved the transaction and recused himself from the vote to approve the transaction. Consistent with Citrix's policies and the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Citrix's Board of Directors, the Merger was reviewed and approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. There are no material relationships among Citrix and XenSource or any of their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves and as disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K. -2-
The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement. Section 3--Securities and Trading Markets Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and assuming no exercises of XenSource stock options prior to the consummation of the transaction, Citrix will issue to the shareholders of XenSource approximately 5.6 million shares of Citrix common stock on the date of the consummation of the transaction. If certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are satisfied, however, the number of shares to be issued could be increased to approximately 7.9 million shares. These shares are expected to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the issuance and exchange of securities approved, after a public hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange, by a state commission authorized by law to grant such approval. Citrix intends to apply for such a public fairness hearing before the Commissioner of the California Department of Corporations, in accordance with Section 25142 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. -3-

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix to Enter Server and Desktop Virtualization Markets with Acquisition of XenSource Combination of Citrix and XenSource Accelerates the Mainstreaming of Virtualization and Strengthens End-to-End Application Delivery Strategy FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today announced a definitive agreement to acquire XenSource, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., a privately held leader in enterprise-grade virtual infrastructure solutions, for approximately $500 million in a combination of cash and stock, which includes the assumption of approximately $107 million in unvested stock options. This acquisition moves Citrix into adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets, expected by Citrix to grow to nearly $5 billion over the next four years.1 The combination of Citrix and XenSource brings together significant customer, technical, channel and go-to-market synergies. This will allow Citrix to extend its leadership in the broader Application Delivery Infrastructure market by adding key enabling technologies that make the end-to-end computing environment far more flexible, dynamic and responsive to business change. The acquisition will also strengthen each company's strong partnership with Microsoft and commitment to the Windows platform. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007 subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. Leveraging the Power of Xen XenSource is the leading provider of enterprise-class virtual infrastructure solutions built on the open source Xen(R) hypervisor. Originally created by the founders of XenSource at University of Cambridge, the Xen virtualization "engine" is now developed collaboratively by an active open source community of senior engineers at many of the industry's most innovative infrastructure companies, including leading hardware vendors like Intel, IBM, HP and AMD. This open collaborative approach significantly accelerates the innovation of the Xen engine, leading to continual state-of-the-art improvements in performance, scalability and cross-platform support. The next-generation Xen architecture is widely acknowledged for its industry-leading performance, efficiency, security and native support for the latest hardware-assisted virtualization features from Intel, AMD and leading device vendors. Today's acquisition announcement comes on the heels of a substantial new release of XenEnterprise(TM), the company's flagship commercial product line powered by the Xen engine. XenEnterprise v4 marks a significant milestone in XenSource's transition from a next-generation technology company into a leading provider of comprehensive enterprise-class virtual infrastructure solutions. With powerful new management, availability and ease-of-use features, XenEnterprise v4 raises the bar as the most open, scalable, high performance virtualization platform on the market. In a recent head-to-head product comparison published this week in CRN, the industry's leading publication for channel resellers and integrators, reviewers praised XenEnterprise v4 as an "easy-to-use, feature rich offering that is quickly catching up to its main rival". Channel partner and customer enthusiasm over the XenEnterprise product line has lead to a rapid increase in customer demand. Version 4 will further accelerate an installed base that has more than doubled in the last 90 days to over 650 customers. "The combination of Citrix and XenSource brings together both presentation and server virtualization to deliver more choice and flexibility to the market, particularly Citrix's strong installed base," said John Humphreys, program vice president of Enterprise Virtualization for IDC. "By adding mobility, monitoring and storage integration in the recently introduced XenEnterprise v4, XenSource has narrowed the capability gap and delivered a viable virtualization solution for server consolidation." Upon close of the acquisition, the XenSource team and products will form the core of the new Virtualization & Management Division of Citrix dedicated to building and growing these important new businesses. Peter Levine, XenSource, CEO, will lead the new division, reporting directly to Mark Templeton, Citrix President and CEO. Under Peter's leadership, Citrix is also committed to maintaining and growing its support for the Xen open source community, led by XenSource co-founder and Xen project leader, Ian Pratt. Between now and the close of the acquisition, XenSource will work with the key contributors to the Xen project to develop procedures for independent oversight of the project, ensuring that it continues to operate with full transparency, fairness and vendor neutrality - principles that are critical to the continued role of Xen as a freely available open source industry standard for virtualization. "Today is a great day for the virtualization market because customers will now have a strong alternative that is open, proven and backed by one of the most successful end-to-end software infrastructure leaders in the entire industry," said Peter Levine, CEO of XenSource. "This move is not about competing for the five percent of the market that is already being served. It's about steering into the 90 percent white space that is wide open, both at the server and in new emerging opportunities at the desktop." "This announcement represents a key milestone for the Xen project," said Ian Pratt, leader of the Xen project and co-founder of XenSource. "Citrix is committed to our community and the principles of transparency and neutrality that allow us to work together on the reference standard for virtualization, promoting the rapid, ubiquitous adoption of virtualization." Strong Alignment with Microsoft The acquisition will also strengthen each company's strong partnership with Microsoft and commitment to the Windows platform. As an independent company, XenSource has built a strategic relationship with Microsoft designed to ensure broad interoperability between XenSource products and the upcoming Microsoft Windows hypervisor, code named "Viridian". This relationship complements and broadens the successful partnership between Citrix and Microsoft in the Windows application delivery, application networking and branch office infrastructure markets. "Although the market is still in the earliest phase, virtualization already offers significant opportunities for cost savings and innovation," said Bob Muglia, Senior Vice President, Microsoft Server & Tools Business. "Citrix and XenSource have long been strong partners for Microsoft and it is exciting to see them team up to help move the market forward." Extending Application Delivery Infrastructure from the Datacenter to the Desktop Virtualization has become one of the most talked-about technologies in recent years because it breaks the "hard-coded" link between hardware and software, allowing individual computing components to be dynamically combined and reassembled for maximum efficiency and agility. Citrix has long been the leading provider of virtualization technologies at the user tier of computing with products that deliver mission-critical applications to end users with the best performance, security and cost savings. This acquisition will allow Citrix to extend its use of virtualization into the logic and data tier of applications, improving overall customer value and enhancing its position as a market leader in end-to-end application delivery infrastructure. In the datacenter, this means extending virtualization to the servers that run the business logic of applications and the storage systems that manage application data. Citrix customers and partners are increasingly requesting non-proprietary, easy-to-use server virtualization solutions that are optimized to work best on the Microsoft Windows platform. Citrix currently intends to distribute the XenEnterprise product line through more than 5,000 channel partners with proven expertise in enterprise datacenter solutions built on the Windows Server platform. The company also plans to leverage its strong relationships with leading server and datacenter infrastructure partners to create additional routes to market through OEM sales channels. In the storage market, Citrix will continue the XenSource strategy of leveraging key industry partners to ensure that the open-architecture XenEnterprise product line fully supports leading storage management and infrastructure solutions and a robust ecosystem of storage software vendors. The two companies share a strong belief that customers should be able to manage their virtual environments with the same proven storage management solutions they use for their physical environments. This strategy is exemplified by the recently announced partnership between Symantec and XenSource which ensures that XenEnterprise works transparently with Symantec's Veritas Storage Foundation and Veritas NetBackup solutions. "Symantec and XenSource share a common belief that customers want unified server and storage virtualization," said Rob Soderbery, senior vice president, Data Center Management Group at Symantec. "Incorporation of Symantec's Veritas Storage Foundation solution into XenSource open-architecture virtualization technology delivers that capability. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Citrix and XenSource to help customers simplify data center operations and dramatically reduce costs." At the desktop, the combination of Citrix and XenSource will help make the emerging market for virtual desktop delivery a mainstream reality. Industry experts estimate that up to 30 million office workers will move to virtual desktops over the next five years, creating a new $1 billion market for desktop virtualization.2 While much of the underlying technology to realize this vision exists today, the available solutions are still far too complex and expensive for most customers to assemble, integrate and manage. By combining the capabilities of XenEnterprise v4 with the newly-released Citrix Desktop Server(TM), Citrix will be able to provide customers with a comprehensive set of desktop delivery solutions that offer unparalleled economics, ease-of-use and end user experience. Citrix further intends to enhance this strategy by incorporating other relevant application delivery infrastructure technologies such as Citrix EdgeSight(TM) end user experience monitoring, Citrix Access Gateway(TM) for secure application access, Citrix WANScaler(TM) for accelerated delivery to branch office users, Citrix(R) GoToAssist(TM) for remote desktop support and the OS-streaming and provisioning capabilities from its recent Ardence acquisition. "We are tremendously excited about the opportunity to add the XenSource products, team and culture to the Citrix family," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Incorporating XenSource's dynamic virtualization services into our market-leading application delivery infrastructure will enable our entire product line to be more flexible, agile and dynamic, qualities that have never been more important than they are today. We believe application delivery will be a defining issue for IT over the next decade because applications are the language of business. Companies that are fluent with application delivery will be the winners, while those who do not will lag behind, struggling with the pace of change in an increasingly dynamic world." Terms of the Agreement Under terms of the definitive agreement, Citrix will acquire XenSource for approximately $500 million in a combination of cash and stock, which includes the assumption of approximately $107 million in unvested stock options. The acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of each company and is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2007. The acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory review and approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, approval by the stockholders of XenSource, Citrix becoming current in its periodic reporting obligations and other customary conditions. Assuming the transaction closes as expected, the acquisition is expected to add approximately $1 million in revenue and $3 million in cost of revenues and operating expenses to fiscal year 2007. The acquisition is expected to add approximately $50 million in revenue and $60 to $70 million in total cost of revenues and operating expenses to fiscal year 2008. The transaction will also result in approximately an $8 to $10 million non-cash expense charge for the write-off of in-process research and development in the quarter in which the acquisition closes. These estimates of cost of revenues and operating expenses do not take into account any stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense, or other charges resulting from the closing of the acquisition.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Files its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 7, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, announced today that it has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As previously announced, these reports were delayed pending the conclusion of the voluntary investigation of the Company's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting conducted by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and a consultation on certain related interpretive issues with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. With the filing of the Annual Report and Quarterly Reports referred to above, the Company believes that it has returned to full compliance with SEC reporting requirements and Nasdaq listing requirements. As a result of the voluntary investigation, on March 14, 2007, the Company announced its intention to restate its previously issued financial statements to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates were revised. In the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company restated its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and each of the quarters in 2006 and 2005 to reflect such additional stock-based compensation expense and related income tax effects for stock option awards granted since late 1995 and the financial statement impact for all subsequent periods. Based on the findings of the voluntary investigation, the Company has recorded a pre-tax cumulative charge of $165.7 million ($120.9 million net of income taxes and other tax charges) in its consolidated financial statements through December 31, 2005 to reflect additional stock-based compensation expense. Of this total cumulative pre-tax charge, $156.3 million ($119.9 million net of income taxes and other tax charges) is related to the years 2003 and earlier. After completion of its investigation, the Audit Committee concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current executive of the Company in connection with the Company's stock option grants and procedures during the period under review (1996-2006). "Citrix is fully committed to compliance with all applicable accounting standards and regulations. The rigor with which the company conducted this voluntary investigation is testimony to our commitment," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We are pleased that the investigation and restatement are complete and are focused on moving forward with our business." Financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at http://www.citrix.com/investors. This press release should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q referred to in this release. About Citrix Citrix Systems, Inc.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the write-off of in-process research and development. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors: -- The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. -- Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. -- Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact because such charges are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Section 2--Financial Information Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On October 19, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), completed its previously announced acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("XenSource"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2007 and as amended on September 20, 2007, by and among Citrix, PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, XenSource, and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative (the "Merger Agreement"). The purchase price was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock, which includes the assumption of approximately $106 million in unvested stock options. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the stock consideration is based on a per share value for Citrix's common stock of $36.18. $62.5 million of the purchase price was placed in escrow as security for the indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement. The purchase price was determined in arms length negotiations between Citrix and XenSource. The Sevin Rosen funds, a venture capital firm, was a stockholder in XenSource. Steve Dow, a director of Citrix, is a general partner of the Sevin Rosen funds and did not directly hold any interest in XenSource. Although the Sevin Rosen funds were represented on the Board of Directors of XenSource, Mr. Dow was not a director of XenSource. The Merger provided a return to all general partners of the firm, including Mr. Dow. Subject to certain assumptions, Citrix currently estimates that the potential allocation to Mr. Dow through the general partner entities of the Sevin Rosen funds related to the Merger is approximately $1.9 million. Mr. Dow has been on the Citrix Board of Directors since 1989 and currently owns 262,349 shares of Citrix common stock. Mr. Dow did not attend the meeting at which the Citrix Board approved the transaction and recused himself from the vote to approve the transaction. Consistent with Citrix's policies and the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Citrix's Board of Directors, the Merger was reviewed and approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. There are no material relationships among Citrix and XenSource or any of their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves and as disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K. The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Completes Acquisition of XenSource LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2007--Today at Citrix iForum(TM), the world's largest application delivery conference and expo, Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) announced it has completed the acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held leader in enterprise-grade virtual infrastructure solutions. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock. This acquisition moves Citrix, a pioneer in the application virtualization market, into adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets -- expected by Citrix to grow to nearly $5 billion over the next four years. By acquiring XenSource, Citrix is now the only company to offer organizations an end-to-end application delivery infrastructure that leverages the method of application, desktop and server virtualization best suited for the dynamic delivery of applications to any user (see today's separate press release on the company's enhanced virtualization strategy). As previously announced on Aug. 15 upon close of the acquisition the XenSource team and products will form the core of the new Virtualization & Management Division of Citrix dedicated to building and growing these important new businesses. Peter Levine, XenSource, CEO, will lead the new division, reporting directly to Mark Templeton, Citrix president and CEO. Under Peter's leadership, this new division will oversee Citrix's businesses in server virtualization and application delivery management solutions as part of the company's overall application delivery infrastructure strategy. Citrix also reiterated its commitment to maintaining and growing support for the independent Xen open source community which develops the underlying virtualization engine used by many commercial products throughout the industry, including those from XenSource. The Xen project, which includes significant contributions from companies like Intel, AMD, HP, IBM and Dell, is led by XenSource co-founder, and new Citrix employee, Ian Pratt. Since news of the acquisition, XenSource has worked with the key contributors to the Xen project to develop procedures for independent oversight of the project, ensuring that it continues to operate with full transparency, fairness and vendor neutrality. Citrix agrees these principles are critical to the continued role of Xen as a freely available open source industry standard for virtualization. "The XenSource products, team and culture are a great addition to the Citrix family," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "The combination of Citrix and XenSource brings together application, desktop and server virtualization to deliver more innovation, choice and flexibility to the market, including our installed base of more than 200,000 customers worldwide. As application delivery becomes a top issue for IT and the world becomes more dynamic, we find it important to be sure we are providing customers the most cutting-edge technologies out there." About iForum 07 - The App Delivery Expo Now in its tenth year, the Citrix App Delivery Expo is the industry's largest conference focused entirely on application delivery infrastructure, bringing together thousands of business leaders, IT managers and technology leaders from around the world. Application delivery infrastructure best practices will be highlighted in more than 60 sessions, including keynotes and general sessions from analysts at Gartner, Forrester, IDC and Yankee Group, as well as industry leaders like Accenture, Dell, Microsoft, HP, IBM, Intel, Oracle and SAP.

Explanatory Note
As previously reported, on October 19, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc. ("Citrix") acquired Xensource Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("Xensource"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2007, by and among Citrix, PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, Xensource and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative. This Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment (Amendment No. 1) to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Citrix on October 22, 2007 to report the completion of its acquisition of Xensource under Items 2.01 and 9.01 (the "Original Form 8-K"). This Amendment No. 1 is being filed to delete Items 9.01(a) and (b) of the Original Form 8-K, which previously referenced Citrix's intention to file financial statements of Xensource and pro forma financial information. Citrix has determined that the acquisition of Xensource did not involve the acquisition of a business that is significant, as such terms are defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and no such filing of financial statements or pro forma financial information is required.
 
On October 19, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), completed its previously announced acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("XenSource"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2007 and as amended on September 20, 2007, by and among Citrix, PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, XenSource, and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative (the "Merger Agreement"). The purchase price was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock, which has been recorded by Citrix as approximately $328.5 million in purchase price consideration payable in cash and common stock plus the issuance of approximately 1.3 million unvested shares of common stock and the assumption of approximately 3.3 million stock options each of which will be exercisable for the right to receive one share of Citrix common stock upon vesting. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the stock consideration is based on a per share value for Citrix's common stock of $36.18. $62.5 million of the purchase price was placed in escrow as security for the indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement. The purchase price was determined in arms length negotiations between Citrix and XenSource.
The Sevin Rosen funds, a venture capital firm, was a stockholder in XenSource. Steve Dow, a director of Citrix, is a general partner of the Sevin Rosen funds and did not directly hold any interest in XenSource. Although the Sevin Rosen funds were represented on the Board of Directors of XenSource, Mr. Dow was not a director of XenSource. The Merger provided a return to all general partners of the firm, including Mr. Dow. Subject to certain assumptions, Citrix currently estimates that the potential allocation to Mr. Dow through the general partner entities of the Sevin Rosen funds related to the Merger is approximately $1.9 million. Mr. Dow has been on the Citrix Board of Directors since 1989 and currently owns 262,349 shares of Citrix common stock. Mr. Dow did not attend the meeting at which the Citrix Board approved the transaction and recused himself from the vote to approve the transaction. Consistent with Citrix's policies and the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Citrix's Board of Directors, the
Merger was reviewed and approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. There are no material relationships among Citrix and XenSource or any of their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves and as disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
LAS VEGAS(BUSINESS WIRE)Oct. 22, 2007Today at Citrix iForum(TM), the world's largest application delivery conference and expo, Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) announced it has completed the acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held leader in enterprise-grade virtual infrastructure solutions. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock.
This acquisition moves Citrix, a pioneer in the application virtualization market, into adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets  expected by Citrix to grow to nearly $5 billion over the next four years. By acquiring XenSource, Citrix is now the only company to offer organizations an end-to-end application delivery infrastructure that leverages the method of application, desktop and server virtualization best suited for the dynamic delivery of applications to any user (see today's separate press release on the company's enhanced virtualization strategy).
As previously announced on Aug. 15 upon close of the acquisition the XenSource team and products will form the core of the new Virtualization & Management Division of Citrix dedicated to building and growing these important new businesses. Peter Levine, XenSource, CEO, will lead the new division, reporting directly to Mark Templeton, Citrix president and CEO. Under Peter's leadership, this new division will oversee Citrix's businesses in server virtualization and application delivery management solutions as part of the company's overall application delivery infrastructure strategy.
Citrix also reiterated its commitment to maintaining and growing support for the independent Xen open source community which develops the underlying virtualization engine used by many commercial products throughout the industry, including those from XenSource. The Xen project, which includes significant contributions from companies like Intel, AMD, HP, IBM and Dell, is led by XenSource co-founder, and new Citrix employee, Ian Pratt. Since news of the acquisition, XenSource has worked with the key contributors to the Xen project to develop procedures for independent oversight of the project, ensuring that it continues to operate with full transparency, fairness and vendor neutrality. Citrix agrees these principles are critical to the continued role of Xen as a freely available open source industry standard for virtualization.
"The XenSource products, team and culture are a great addition to the Citrix family," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "The combination of Citrix and XenSource brings together application, desktop and server virtualization to deliver more innovation, choice and flexibility to the market, including our installed base of more than 200,000 customers worldwide. As application delivery becomes a top issue for IT and the world becomes more dynamic, we find it important to be sure we are providing customers the most cutting-edge technologies out there."

On December 6, 2007, the Board of Directors of Citrix Systems, Inc. ("Citrix") amended Section 1.9 of its By-laws to change the voting standard for the election of directors from a plurality of the votes cast to a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections, the voting standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, Section 1.10 of Citrix's By-laws was amended to require stockholder nominees for director elections to submit a written statement that he or she, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following his or her election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon his or her failure to receive the required vote for re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors.
The press release announcing the By-law amendments disclosed in this Item 5.03 is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Citrix's Amended and Restated By-laws are filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with the amendment to Citrix's By-laws implementing a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, on December 6, 2007, Citrix amended its Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to provide, among other things, that the Board of Directors expects a director to tender his or her resignation if he or she fails to receive the required number of votes for re-election. Further, the Guidelines provide that (i) the Board of Directors shall nominate for election or re-election as a director only candidates who agree to tender irrevocable resignations that will be effective upon the failure to receive the required vote at the next annual meeting at which they face re-election and Board acceptance of such resignation, and (ii) the Board of Directors shall fill director vacancies and new directorships only with candidates who agree to tender, promptly following their appointment to the Board of Directors, the same form of resignation tendered by other directors in accordance with the Guidelines.
The Guidelines were also amended to provide that if an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of votes cast, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall promptly consider his or her resignation, and make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote.
The Guidelines continue to provide that the Board of Directors shall promptly disclose its decision whether to accept a director's offer of resignation and the factors it considered in making its decision in a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board (if any), a majority of the Board of Directors or the President and shall be held at such place, on such date and at such time as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or the person calling the meeting.

1.3

. Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

1.6
Quorum
. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these By-Laws by the stockholders present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum, or, if no stockholder is present, by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting. It shall not be necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment of less than 30 days if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
1.7
Adjournments
. At any meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote at such meeting held of record by such stockholder and a proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.

No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from the date of its execution, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 1.8 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
1.8
Voting and Proxies
 
In the election of directors, voting shall be by written ballot, and for any other action, voting need not be by ballot.
The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at such meeting may, and to the extent required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
. When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the stock present or represented and voting on a matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, the holders of a majority of the stock of that class present or represented and voting on such matter) shall decide any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders at such meeting, except when a different vote is required by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in these By-Laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the tenth day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. For the purposes of this paragraph, Broker Non-Votes represented at the meeting but not permitted to vote on a particular matter shall not be counted, with respect to the vote on such matter, in the number of votes cast, votes cast affirmatively, or votes cast negatively.

 Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today announced that it has amended its corporate bylaws to change the voting standard for the election of directors from a plurality of votes cast to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. Contested elections (in which there are more nominees than directors to be elected) will continue to use the plurality standard. Citrix is joining other technology leaders in delivering corporate governance excellence and greater accountability of directors to stockholders.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  Dec. 12, 2007
Under the laws of Delaware, where Citrix is incorporated, if an incumbent director is not elected, that director continues to serve as a "holdover director" until the director's successor is duly elected and qualified or that director resigns. To address this potential outcome, the board has also amended its director resignation policy to provide that only candidates who agree to tender irrevocable resignations will be nominated for election or re-election as a director. In an uncontested election, if an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of votes cast, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall promptly consider his or her resignation, and make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. The Board will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it promptly thereafter.
The new majority vote standard is effective immediately and will be implemented at Citrix's upcoming annual meeting of stockholders on May 30, 2008.
Additional information on Citrix's board of directors and corporate governance guidelines are available at www.citrix.com/aboutcitrix/governance.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.61 to $1.64. In addition, this number excludes $0.27 related to the effects of the amortization of intangible assets and $0.49 to $0.50 related to the effects of stock-based compensation expenses.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In our earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement and can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at http://www.citrix.com/investors.

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures (Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the write-off of in-process research and development. The companys basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the companys performance and to evaluate and compensate the companys executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the companys historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the companys gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the companys financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the companys operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the companys operating performance due to the following factors:
The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the companys employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact because such charges are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the companys liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

(e) See Item 8.01 below for information concerning compensation related arrangements with certain executive officers of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company").
 
Background
On November 30, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company commenced a voluntary, independent investigation of the Company's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting during the period from January 1996 through December 2006. This voluntary investigation was not in response to any governmental investigation, stockholder lawsuit, whistleblower complaint or inquiries from media organizations. The Audit Committee's voluntary investigation was completed in June 2007, and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was filed on September 7, 2007, contains a description of the Audit Committee's investigation, management's related review, the conclusions of the Audit Committee and management and the restatement of the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and each of the quarters in the 2006 and 2005 fiscal years, to reflect additional stock-based compensation expense and related income tax effects for stock option awards granted since December 1995. After completion of its investigation, the Audit Committee concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current executive of the Company in connection with the Company's stock option grants and procedures during the period under review (1996-2006).
The Company has taken actions to address certain adverse tax consequences that were incurred by non-executive employees holding stock options which were granted with per share exercise prices found in the voluntary investigation to be below the fair market value of a share of Citrix common stock on the date of grant (referred to as 409A stock options). The primary adverse tax consequence is that the 409A stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 subject the option holder to a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (and, as applicable, similar excise taxes under state laws) and the accelerated recognition of ordinary income tax liabilities associated with any vested but unexercised 409A stock options. Pursuant to IRS regulations, the Company's executive officers were not eligible to participate in the Company's Section 409A relief actions.
Section 409A Impact on Executive Officers
As a result, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services, and General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources are subject to excise tax liabilities, inclusive of interest on such liabilities, under Section 409A for exercised 409A stock options in the amounts of approximately $121,000, $34,000 and $563,000, respectively. For any vested but unexercised 409A stock options, these executive officers are also required to pay ordinary income taxes on the difference between the fair market value of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2007 ($38.01 per share) and the exercise price of their affected options. For these executives, such accelerated ordinary income amounts for 2007 are approximately $528,000, $114,000 and $1.4 million, respectively.
Actions by Executive Officers to Address 409A Tax Liabilities
Withholding taxes in connection with the ordinary income tax liabilities associated with vested but unexercised 409A stock options are due to the Internal Revenue Service by January 31, 2008. In order to pay such required withholding, on January 30 and 31, 2008, each of these executive officers exercised and sold all their 409A stock options. Approximately 70,000 409A stock options with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $8.72 per share were sold by these executives for this purpose. On January 29, 2008, the Company's General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources terminated an existing trading plan complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that contained such 409A stock options to permit the exercise and sale of such stock options and to pay the related withholding tax obligations so that no further Section 409A liabilities would be incurred on such options.
Actions by Citrix to Address 409A Tax Liabilities of Executive Officers
To facilitate the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services, and General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources with handling the adverse tax consequences associated with their 409A stock options, on January 27, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors approved a one-time cash payment to each of these executives in the amount of such officer's excise tax liability, inclusive of interest and grossed-up for taxes that will be owed by the executives on such one-time cash payments, under Section 409A in the amounts of approximately $211,000, $59,000 and $982,000, respectively. These amounts are related to two stock option grants: approximately $892,000 is with respect to the new hire grant made to the Company's General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources on October 1, 2002 upon the commencement of his employment with the Company, and approximately $360,000 is with respect to the 2003 annual grant to executives issued by the Company on March 4, 2003 as part of the Company's standard executive compensation practices. Such payments do not cover the ordinary income tax liabilities incurred by these officers as of December 31, 2007 with respect to unexercised Section 409A stock options.
In addition, to further the Company's compensation goals of aligning employee and stockholder interests and closely linking employee compensation with company performance, on January 31, 2008, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors approved a one-time stock option grant to each of these executive officers equal to the number of shares that he was required to exercise in order to pay his ordinary income tax withholding obligations (20,313 shares for the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, 4,375 shares for the Company's Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services and 45,647 shares for the Company's General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources). These grants will be issued by the Company on February 1, 2008 and will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock as of such date. Such stock options will vest over a 12 month period on a monthly basis and will expire five years after the grant date.
The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors took these actions based on the conclusions of the Audit Committee's stock option investigation and after consultation with the Audit Committee about the information collected and reviewed by the Audit Committee during its investigation. The Compensation Committee's actions and recommendations to the Board of Directors was based in part on a finding that the Company's General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources had no involvement in the process of granting his new hire stock option grant; the Company's Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services had no involvement in the process of granting any 409A stock options; and neither the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer nor the Company's General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Human Resources were aware that, as of the grant date of the 2003 annual grant to executives, all required granting actions for financial accounting purposes had not been completed. Further the Compensation Committee considered that, because the stock option investigation concluded in 2007, under the rules of the Internal Revenue Service the Company was not permitted to resolve the executives' 409A-related liabilities by repricing the executives' 409A stock options, as did a significant number of companies whose stock option investigations concluded in 2006. Given the findings of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee viewed as unfair the significant tax liabilities accruing to the executives because of the timing of the conclusion of the Audit Committee's stock option investigation.
Conclusion of SEC's Review of Citrix's Stock Option Investigation
As previously disclosed, during the course of the Company's stock option investigation, the Company proactively discussed the results of its investigation with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As part of this process, the Company provided the Staff with information regarding the Company's restatement and its investigation. On January 30, 2008, the Company received a letter from the Staff stating that the Staff has completed its investigation as to the Company and that the Staff does not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the Company.

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, and the write-off of in-process research and development. The companys basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the companys performance and to evaluate and compensate the companys executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the companys historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the companys gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the companys financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the companys operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the companys operating performance due to the following factors:
The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the companys employees and executives, with respect to stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact, such charges are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the companys liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In our earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement and can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures (Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expenses. The companys basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the companys performance and to evaluate and compensate the companys executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the companys historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the companys gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the companys financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the companys operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the companys operating performance due to the following factors:
The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the companys employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the companys liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

On July 23, 2008, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2008 ended June 30, 2008 (the "Press Release"). The Press Release also included the Company's financial outlook for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Press Release was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 23, 2008.
Subsequent to the issuance of the Press Release, it was discovered that the expected GAAP diluted earnings per share included in the Press Release did not reflect the effect of the differential between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates related to the amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense that had been used by the Company to determine the expected non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the respective periods. Including these tax effects, the range of expected GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 should have been $0.18 to $0.23; and the range of expected GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 should have been $0.83 to $0.91. The foregoing does not impact the expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the same periods included in the Press Release, nor does it reflect any change in or update to the assumptions used by the Company to determine the non-GAAP expected future earnings per share included in the Press Release, which speaks only as of the date of the Press Release.
The following table shows the expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 included in the Press Release, reconciled to the expected GAAP earnings per share numbers described above.
 
The above information is based on the Company's expectations as of the date of the Press Release, and speaks only as of the date of the Press Release. The Company is not otherwise updating its previous expected future earnings per share statements, nor is it affirming such statements as of the date of this report. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Investors are cautioned that the statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not strictly historical statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding expected future earnings per share derived in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, constitute forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: the uncertainty in the IT spending environment and the risk of a downturn in economic conditions generally; the success and growth of the Company's product lines, including risks associated with successfully introducing new products into the Company's distribution channels; risks in effectively controlling operating expenses; the Company's product concentration and its ability to develop and commercialize new products and services; disruptions due to changes in key personnel; the success of investments in its product groups, foreign operations and vertical and geographic markets; the Company's and Microsoft's ability to develop and market application delivery and virtualization products; the introduction of new products by competitors or the entry of new competitors into the markets for the Company's products; failure to further develop and successfully market the technology and products of acquired companies, including the possible failure to achieve or maintain anticipated revenues and profits from acquisitions; failure to execute the Company's sales and marketing plans; failure to successfully partner with key distributors, resellers, OEM's and strategic partners; the Company's ability to maintain and expand its business in small sized and large enterprise accounts; the size, timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders; the effect of new accounting pronouncements on revenue and expense recognition; the Company's reliance on and the success of the Company's independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of the Company's products and the success of the Company's marketing and licensing programs; litigation; increased competition; changes in the Company's pricing policies or those of its competitors; charges in the event of the impairment of assets acquired through business combinations and licenses; impairment of the value of the Company's investment in auction rate securities; the management of anticipated future growth and the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, including those of acquired companies; competition and other risks associated with the markets for our Web-based access, collaboration and customer assistance services and for the Company's Web application delivery appliances; risks of political and social turmoil; and other risks detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K or with respect to the matters described herein, which Report is current as of the date of issuance only.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this report, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to SEC requirements, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the table above. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expenses. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 
 
 
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effect of those items. The companys basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the companys performance and to evaluate and compensate the companys executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the companys historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the companys gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the companys financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the companys operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the companys operating performance due to the following factors:
 The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the companys employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the companys liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 2.04 Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
On September 23, 2008, Citrix Systems, Inc. ("Citrix") provided notice to SELCO Service Corp. ("SELCO" or the "Lessor") of its election to exercise its option under the Master Lease between Citrix and Lessor, dated as of April 23, 2002 and as amended to date (the "Lease"), to purchase the property subject to the Lease and terminate the Lease. The Lease provided a synthetic lease arrangement for Citrix's corporate headquarters office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On October 23, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix acquired the corporate headquarters office from the Lessor, and the parties to the Lease terminated the Lease.
In connection with the termination of the Lease, the Participation Agreement, dated as of April 23, 2002, by and among Citrix, Peninsula Investment Corp., SELCO and Key Corporate Capital, Inc. and other documents related to the Lease were also terminated. A copy of the Lease was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") by Citrix as Exhibit 10.13 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, and copies of the Participation Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Participation Agreement were filed with the SEC by Citrix as Exhibits 10.11 and 10.12, respectively, to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
Citrix elected to exercise its option to acquire its corporate headquarters office and terminate the Lease in order to ensure its long term occupancy of the corporate headquarters office in a financially efficient manner. Under the terms of the Lease, Citrix would have been required to notify the Lessor of its intent to re-market the property by October 23, 2008 or had another lease arrangement in place to continue leasing the property and recording the arrangement as an off-balance sheet arrangement. Since Citrix intended to purchase the corporate headquarters office at the expiration of the Lease for the reasons discussed above, the decision was made to exercise its purchase option at the re-marketing date and record the property as an asset. The purchase price to acquire the property was approximately $61.3 million, which represents the original property cost and the transaction expenses of the Lessor and Key Corporate Capital, Inc. There were no lease breakage costs incurred. At the time Citrix entered into the Lease, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix pledged certain collateral to the Lessor and Key Corporate Capital, Inc., as administrative agent, and Citrix classified such collateral as restricted cash equivalents and investments on its balance sheet. That collateral was released in connection with the acquisition of the property by Citrix's wholly-owned subsidiary and the termination of the Lease and used to fund payment of the purchase price. Citrix does not expect that the acquisition of the corporate headquarters office and termination of the Lease will have a material impact on Citrix's results of operations or liquidity during the period in which the property was purchased and the Lease was terminated.
The Lease previously represented a form of off-balance sheet financing under which SELCO, an unrelated third party lessor, funded 100% of the costs of the original acquisition of the property, and leased the property to Citrix. The initial term of the Lease was seven years and, subject to approval by the Lessor, Citrix had the ability to renew the Lease twice for additional two-year periods. The lease payments varied based on LIBOR, plus a margin. Citrix had the option, which it exercised on September 23, 2008, to purchase the property upon thirty days' written notice for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. The Lease also provided Citrix with the option to sublease the property and, upon at least 180 days' notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term, to remarket the property for sale to a third party.
Had Citrix not elected to purchase the property prior to the end of the lease term, possession of the buildings would have been returned to the Lessor and Citrix would have been responsible for its guaranty to the Lessor of a residual value of approximately $51.9 million. Citrix has evaluated the property on a periodic basis throughout the term of the Lease for indications of permanent impairment. If any evaluation had indicated that the fair value of the property had declined below $51.9 million, Citrix would have been responsible for the difference under its residual value guarantee.
 
The Lease also contained certain financial covenants, including covenants relating to minimum cash and investment balances, and certain non-financial covenants, including covenants relating to the maintenance of property, adequate insurance, delivery of financial statements and payment of taxes. Following termination of the Lease, Citrix is no longer required to comply with these financial and non-financial covenants.

On January 28,2009, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release regarding its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and the year ended December 31, 2008.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
Item 2.05.     Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
To allow the Company to operate more efficiently and to drive long-term changes in the Companys cost model, on January 28, 2009, the Company announced the implementation of a restructuring program and steps to reduce its headcount by approximately 500 full-time positions representing approximately 10 percent of the Companys global workforce (the Restructuring Program). In connection with the Restructuring Program, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a severance pay and benefits plan on January 27, 2009.
The Company currently expects to incur in the aggregate a pre-tax charge in the range of approximately $19 million to $23 million related to its global workforce reduction. The Company currently expects to record these charges primarily in the first fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009.  Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures.
The Company also expects to incur cash and non-cash charges related to the consolidation of facilities as part of the Restructuring Program.  Because the details of its facilities consolidation are not yet final, the Company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of cash and non-cash charges it may incur in connection with its facilities consolidation or the total amount expected to be incurred in connection with the Restructuring Program.  The Company currently anticipates completing the majority of the activities related to the Restructuring Program by the end of 2009.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 28, 2009--Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, and announced a restructuring program to reduce its annual operating expenses.

For the fiscal year 2008, Citrix reported annual revenues of $1.58 billion, compared to $1.39 billion in the previous year, a 14 percent increase.
GAAP Results
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was $60 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $63 million, or $0.33 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007.

Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $87 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $95 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in-process research and development (IPR&D), and the tax effects related to those items. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 also excludes a non-cash benefit of approximately $6 million related to the adjustment of payroll taxes accrued in connection with the companys voluntary, independent investigation of its historical stock option granting practices (stock option review) that was concluded in 2007.
Annual non-GAAP net income for 2008 was $304 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $299 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in 2007. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of IPR&D, and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, non-GAAP net income for 2008 excludes the non-cash benefit related to the adjustment of payroll taxes taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Restructuring Program
Citrix also announced the implementation of a restructuring program and steps to reduce its headcount by approximately 10 percent of the company's global workforce. Citrix also expects to incur cash and non-cash charges related to the consolidation of facilities as part of the restructuring program. Because the details of its facilities consolidation are not yet final, the company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of charges it may incur in connection with its facilities consolidation.
"Im pleased with our Q4 results and performance for 2008  especially in the face of an extraordinary worldwide environment," said Mark Templeton, Citrix president and chief executive officer.
"While being fiscally cautious, we are more confident than ever in our vision and business strategy. Citrix products have a long track record of reducing IT costs, while simplifying enterprise computing  exactly what customers need.

Financial Outlook

First Quarter 2009
Citrix management currently expects to achieve the following results during its first fiscal quarter 2009 ending March 31, 2009:
Net revenue to be down approximately 5 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2008;
Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2008, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges; and,

Primarily in the first fiscal quarter 2009, Citrix expects to incur a pre-tax charge in the range of $19 million to $23 million related to its global workforce reduction. Because the details of its facilities consolidation are not yet final, the company is unable at this time to estimate the amount of charges it may incur in connection with its facilities consolidation.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Fiscal Year 2009
Citrix management currently expects to achieve the following results for the fiscal year 2009:

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In our earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement and can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, the write-off of in-process research and development, stock-based compensation expenses, the non-cash benefit related to the adjustment of payroll taxes accrued in connection with the companys voluntary, independent investigation of historical stock option granting practices that was concluded in 2007 and the related tax effect of those items. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The non-cash benefit related to payroll taxes originally arose out of the companys voluntary, independent investigation of its historical stock option granting practices but is a benefit in the current period, the exclusion of which will better help investors and financial analysts understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

(3) A stockholder providing timely notice under this Section 1.10 of nominations or business proposed to be brought before a stockholder meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information (including, without limitation, the Material Ownership Interests information) provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 1.10 shall be true and correct as of the record date for such stockholder meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to such stockholder meeting, and such update and supplement shall be in writing and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the fifth (5th) business day after the record date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than the close of business on the eighth (8th) business day prior to the date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting).
(4) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased
 
Board of Directors at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, at least seventy (70) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.10 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, who is present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting, and who complies with the notice procedures (including the procedures to update and supplement such notice) set forth in this Section 1.10. If the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if such stockholder has complied with the following procedures: (i) stockholder's written notice has been received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the later of (x) the close of business of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or (y) the close of business of the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting; (ii) such stockholder's written notice includes the information required to be provided in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10, and (iii) such stockholder has provided updates or supplements (if any) to such notice at the times and in the forms required by paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 1.10. For the avoidance of doubt, for a stockholder to bring nominations before a special meeting of stockholders, such stockholder must comply with the notice and other procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and this shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring such nominations properly before a special meeting.

Exhibit 99.1
Citrix Reports First Quarter Financial Results
Quarterly Revenue of $369 million
GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.04
Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.32
Board of Directors Authorizes $300 Million Increase to Share Repurchase Program
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2009--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended March 31, 2009.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Citrix achieved revenue of $369 million, compared to $377 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, representing a 2 percent decrease in revenue.
GAAP Results
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share compared to $34 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008. These GAAP results include a restructuring charge of approximately $21 million.
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $59 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $66 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2009 also excludes the effect of the restructuring program that the company implemented in January 2009.
"Im pleased with our Q1 execution in the toughest macro environment weve seen in years," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer. "Smaller IT budgets are the new reality. We believe this makes our enterprise and SaaS products even more compelling because they lower IT costs while offering much-needed business flexibility."
In addition to quarterly financial results, Citrix also announced that its board of directors has authorized it to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of its common stock. As of March 31, 2009, approximately $50 million remained in authority from previous approvals.
Q1 Financial Summary
In reviewing the first quarter results of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008:
Product license revenue decreased 24 percent;
Revenue from license updates grew 11 percent;
Online services revenue grew 16 percent;
Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 8 percent;
Revenue decreased in the Americas region by 1 percent; the EMEA region by 11 percent, and the Pacific region by 9 percent;
Deferred revenue totaled $535 million, compared to $459 million on March 31, 2008;
GAAP operating margin was 1 percent for the quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin was 19 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense and costs associated with the restructuring program;
Cash flow from operations was $82 million; and
The company repurchased 1.1 million shares at an average price of $22.66.
Financial Outlook
Due to the volatility of market conditions in the foreseeable future, it is more likely that Citrixs actual results could differ materially from expectations. Consequently, the company is providing less quantitative guidance than in previous quarters.
Financial Outlook for Second Quarter 2009
Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during its second fiscal quarter 2009 ending June 30, 2009:
Net revenue is expected to be flat to slightly down compared to the net revenue reported for the second quarter of 2008; and,
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase between 100 and 150 basis points compared to the second quarter 2008, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009
Citrix management currently expects to achieve the following results for the fiscal year 2009:
The company expects net revenue to be flat as compared to 2008; and,
Non-GAAP operating margin to increase by as much as 100 basis points as compared to non-GAAP operating margin from the prior year, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring program, as well as prior year exclusions of in-process research and development related to business combinations.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with its restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Quarterly Revenue of $393 Million
GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.23
Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.39
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 22, 2009--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended June 30, 2009.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Citrix achieved revenue of $393 million, compared to $392 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
GAAP Results
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $43 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $35 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008. The current quarter GAAP results include a restructuring charge of approximately $2 million.
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $72 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $71 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expense and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2009 excludes charges recorded in connection with the restructuring program that the company implemented in January 2009, and the tax effects related to those items.
"I'm pleased with our second quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We are still in a tough economic climate, especially in the EMEA market, but our customers are embracing IT as an on-demand service, confirming our strategy around desktop virtualization, the next generation datacenter and SaaS."
Q2 Financial Summary
In reviewing the second quarter results for 2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008:
Product license revenue decreased 15 percent;
Revenue from license updates grew 9 percent;
Online services revenue grew 18 percent;
Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 3 percent;
Revenue increased in the Americas region by 3 percent, decreased in the EMEA region by 12 percent, and decreased in the Pacific region by 4 percent;
Deferred revenue totaled $538 million, compared to $476 million on June 30, 2008;
GAAP operating margin was 10 percent for the quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin was 22 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense and costs associated with the restructuring program;
Cash flow from operations was $86 million; and
The company repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $30.32.
Financial Outlook
Due to the volatility of market conditions in the foreseeable future, it is more likely that Citrixs actual results could differ materially from expectations. Similar to the financial outlook we have provided for the last two fiscal quarters, the company is continuing to provide less quantitative guidance than it has historically.
Financial Outlook for Third Quarter 2009
Citrix management currently expects to achieve the following results during its third fiscal quarter of 2009 ending September 30, 2009:
Net revenue is expected to be flat compared to the third quarter of 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points compared to the second quarter 2009, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges, if any.
Interest income is expected to be $3 million to $4 million.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009
Our financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2009 for both net revenue and non-GAAP operating margin remains unchanged.
The company expects net revenue to be flat as compared to 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by as much as 100 basis points compared to non-GAAP operating margin from the prior year, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges, as well as prior year exclusions of in process research and development related to business combinations.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In our earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement and can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with its restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Exhibit 99.1
Citrix Reports Third Quarter Financial Results
Quarterly Revenue of $401 million
GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.29
Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.43
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 21, 2009--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended September 30, 2009.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Citrix achieved revenue of $401 million, compared to $399 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
GAAP Results
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $53 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $49 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008.
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $80 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for both periods excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expense and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2009 excludes charges recorded in connection with the restructuring program that the company implemented in January 2009, and the tax effects related to those items.
I'm pleased with our solid third quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. Our sales, product and operational teams executed very well in a tough economic climate to not only post good results, but to strengthen Citrix leadership in the web collaboration, desktop virtualization and datacenter transformation markets.
Q3 Financial Summary
In reviewing the third quarter results of 2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008:
Product license revenue decreased 18 percent;
Revenue from license updates grew 7 percent;
Online services revenue grew 21 percent;
Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 20 percent;
Revenue decreased in the EMEA region by 15 percent; decreased in the Pacific region by 5 percent; and increased in the Americas region by 5 percent;
Deferred revenue grew to $556 million, compared to $481 million on September 30, 2008;
GAAP operating margin was 14 percent for the quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 25 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense and costs associated with the restructuring program;
Cash flow from operations was $134 million; and
The company repurchased 2.1 million shares at an average price of $35.56.
Financial Outlook
Due to the volatility of market conditions in the foreseeable future, it is more likely that the companys actual results could differ materially from expectations. Similar to the financial outlook we have provided for the last two fiscal quarters, Citrix is continuing to provide less quantitative guidance than it has historically.
Financial Outlook for Fourth Quarter 2009
Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during its fourth fiscal quarter 2009 ending December 31, 2009:
Net revenue is expected to increase three to four percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase 50 to 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2008, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges as well as prior year exclusions of in-process research and development related to business combinations.
Interest income is expected to be $5 million.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009
The companys financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2009 for both net revenue and non-GAAP operating margin remains unchanged.
The company expects net revenue to increase modestly as compared to 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by as much as 100 basis points compared to non-GAAP operating margin from the prior year, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges, as well as prior year exclusions of in process research and development related to business combinations.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Preliminary Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2010
The companys preliminary financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2010 is for net revenue to increase between eight and nine percent over full fiscal year 2009, and to continue operational leverage to drive a 75 to 100 basis point expansion in non-GAAP operating margin over the full fiscal year 2009. Non-GAAP operating margin excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Company, Product and Alliance Highlights
During the third quarter of 2009, Citrix announced:
Availability of enhancements to Citrix XenApp 5 including the ability to deliver on-demand applications from virtual machines (VMs) for 100 percent application compatibility, as well as new HDX 3D technology, also available in Citrix XenDesktop, that provides a high-definition experience for even the most intensive multimedia applications.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrix's earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Im pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, and for the full year in light of the uncertain market conditions we faced, said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix.
In the fourth quarter, we saw a lot of interest in desktop virtualization. That combined with the timely launch of XenDesktop and uncommitted IT budget dollars, helped propel a record-breaking quarter. For the full year, our disciplined financial and operational management served us well, and we are positioned for continued improvement in our cost model. In addition, we continue to see CIOs looking for ways to simplify and drive costs out of enterprise computing. Going forward, well set our sights on helping those CIOs by bringing desktop virtualization to the mainstream, broadening the reach of web collaboration, and powering public and private clouds.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrixs earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, the write-off of in-process research and development, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys restructuring program, the non-cash benefit related to the adjustment of payroll taxes accrued in connection with the Companys voluntary, independent investigation of historical stock option granting practices that was concluded in 2007 and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
 The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
 The non-cash benefit related to payroll taxes originally arose out of the Companys voluntary, independent investigation of its historical stock option granting practices but was a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2008, the exclusion of which will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Companys operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In the companys earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
 The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and in effect, the "Plan") to (i) increase the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by 5,500,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), and (ii) increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units or stock grants by 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Plan Amendment"); and

As previously reported by Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company"), during the third quarter of 2009, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") concluded its examination of the Company's income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 and issued a Revenue Agent's Report (the "RAR"). The RAR asserted income tax deficiencies of approximately $81.3 million (excluding interest) for tax years 2004 and 2005. The Company agreed with all of the adjustments contained in the RAR, with the exception of those related to transfer pricing and consequential adjustments involving the intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property in earlier tax years. The transfer pricing and any consequential adjustments to the Company's 2004 and 2005 tax years would impact its income tax liabilities in tax years subsequent to 2005. The Company filed a protest with respect to these adjustments, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS.
In June, 2010, the Company reached a settlement in principle with the IRS regarding the income tax deficiencies asserted in the RAR. Under the terms of the settlement in principle, the Company would agree to an assessment of income tax deficiencies in full settlement of all open claims under the RAR and would resolve with finality for future years all of the transfer pricing issues raised in the RAR. Based on this, the Company expects to incur a charge of approximately $12 to $15 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 under Accounting Standards Codification No. 740, "" ("ASC 740"). Among other things, ASC 740 requires application of a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and non-recognition of tax positions. It further requires that a change in management judgment related to prior years' tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change.
Income Taxes
The final settlement requires the finalization of tax deficiency calculations with the IRS and a written agreement signed by the IRS. This process could take several more months to complete. There can be no assurances that a final written agreement will be obtained or that this matter will otherwise be resolved in the Company's favor. An adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
 
As described above, the Company expects to incur a charge of approximately $12 to $15 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the settlement in principle with the IRS, which is expected to impact the Company's diluted earnings per share by approximately $(0.06) to $(0.08) per share in both the second quarter and for the full fiscal year 2010. This charge was not included in the Company's previous second quarter or full fiscal year 2010 earnings per share guidance provided by the Company in its press release dated April 21, 2010.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, Citrix achieved revenue of $458 million, compared to $393 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, representing 17 percent revenue growth.
GAAP Results
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $48 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $43 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $78 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $72 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 includes the $13 million tax expense, or approximately $0.07 per diluted share, as noted above. Both periods exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges recorded in connection with the restructuring program that the company implemented in January 2009 and the tax effects related to those items.
Im very pleased with our performance for the second quarter. We demonstrated great execution across all geographies, divisions and functional teams, said Mark Templeton, president and CEO for Citrix.
Leading indicators for the second half are solid. We are seeing excellent vibrancy in the channel, higher levels of strategic engagement with our customers, and really good pipeline growth.
We are excited about the trajectory we are seeing in XenDesktop licensing. Clearly, the desktop virtualization revolution is here now and adoption is accelerating. By our measures, we are now number one in this market.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrixs earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statements or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization of intangible assets primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

It is clear we are at the intersection of three powerful market forces - the transformation of IT to an on-demand service; the consumerization of IT in the enterprise; and, the promise of cloud services.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.

There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization of intangible assets primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrixs earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

Citrix, XenDesktop, Receiver, XenServer, OpenCloud, NetScaler, and VPX are trademarks or registered trademarks of Citrix Systems, Inc. and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, and may be registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries. All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
 The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

GAAP Results
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $82 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to $48 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2010.

Our passion is to make it easy for customers facing this transition  helping them build new clouds, connect to cloud services, and empower their users to work and play from anywhere.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its financial outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company will continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrixs earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statements or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .
http://www.citrix.com/investors
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrixs earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statements or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .
http://www.citrix.com/investors
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
 The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys 2009 restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
 The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's 2009 restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 9, 2012, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), completed its previously announced acquisition of Bytemobile, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Bytemobile"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Citrix, Beringer Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Sub"), Bytemobile and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as the Holder representative ("SRS"). Bytemobile is a provider of data and video optimization solutions for mobile network operators and its technology portfolio includes applications for video and web optimization, content caching, policy control, traffic management, mobile analytics and deep packet inspection. Citrix assigned the Merger Agreement to Citrix Systems International GmbH, a subsidiary of Citrix organized under the laws of Switzerland ("Citrix GmbH"), as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on July 9, 2012, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Bytemobile (the "Merger"), with Bytemobile surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix GmbH.
The Merger consideration paid by Citrix GmbH consisted of approximately $435 million in cash (subject to certain closing adjustments described in the Merger Agreement), payable to holders of Bytemobile's capital stock, warrants and options pursuant to formulas detailed in the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Merger, $43.50 million of the net Merger consideration payable to holders of Bytemobile's capital stock and warrants (the "Holders") was deposited into an escrow account to satisfy any indemnification claims that may arise under the Merger Agreement. Except as may be reduced to satisfy indemnification claims, approximately $21.75 million will be released from the escrow account to the Holders on a pro rata basis on the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, approximately $16.75 million will be released from the escrow account to the Holders on a pro rata basis on the second anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, and the balance of funds in the escrow account will be released to the Holders on a pro rata basis on the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. The Merger consideration was determined in arms-length negotiations between Citrix and Bytemobile. There are no material relationships between Citrix and Bytemobile or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers, or any associate of any such director or officer, or any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and related agreements, other than in respect of the Merger and as disclosed herein.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release announcing the closing of the acquisition is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
Execution Version
 
 
 
This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") contains representations and warranties that Citrix Systems, Inc. or its permitted assignees ("Citrix"), Bytemobile, Inc. ("Bytemobile") and Beringer Acquisition Corporation made to one another. These representations and warranties were made only for the purposes of the Agreement and solely for the benefit of Bytemobile and Citrix as of specific dates, may be subject to important limitations and qualifications agreed to by Bytemobile and Citrix and included in confidential disclosure schedules provided by Bytemobile to Citrix in connection with the signing of the Agreement, and may not be complete. Furthermore, these representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between Bytemobile and Citrix instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may or may not have been accurate as of any specific date and do not purport to be accurate as of the date of the filing of the Agreement by Citrix with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts, since they were intended to be for the benefit of, and to be limited to, Bytemobile and Citrix.

(ii) The Holder Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the calculation of Closing Working Capital or Closing
 
Indebtedness by notifying Buyer in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail (to the extent such information is available to the Holder Representative at such time), the basis for such dispute, within thirty (30) days of Buyer's or the Surviving Corporation's, as the case may be, delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 1.6(e)(i) above. If the Holder Representative delivers a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day period, the Holder Representative and Buyer shall, during the forty-five (45) days following such delivery, each use good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to finally determine the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness. If the Holder Representative and Buyer are unable to reach agreement concerning the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness during such forty-five (45)-day period, they shall promptly thereafter submit the dispute to the Accounting Referee for resolution pursuant to Section 1.6(f).
(iii) The Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively determined for purposes of this Agreement upon the date (the "") that is the earlier to occur of (1) the failure of the Holder Representative to notify Buyer of a dispute within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet as set forth in Section 1.6(e)(ii) above, (2) the written resolution of all disputes pursuant to Section 1.6(e)(ii) by Buyer and the Holder Representative, and (3) the resolution of all disputes by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 1.6(f). Within three (3) Business Days of the Determination Date: if the difference of (A) the Closing Working Capital plus the Closing Indebtedness minus (B) the Estimated Working Capital plus the Estimated Indebtedness is not zero, then (1) to the extent such difference is negative (the absolute value of such negative amount, the ""), the Holder Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to transfer from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to Buyer an amount equal to the Buyer Adjustment Amount, and the Buyer Adjustment Amount shall be deemed a decrease to the Merger Consideration, and (2) to the extent such difference is positive (such positive amount, the ""), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the Holder Adjustment Amount to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Holders in proportion to their Pro Rata Shares, and the Holder Adjustment Amount shall be deemed an increase to the Merger Consideration.

(f) . If the Holder Representative and Buyer are unable to reach agreement concerning the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness pursuant to Section 1.6(e), they shall submit such dispute to Deloitte LLP or, if not available, such other nationally recognized independent accounting expert selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Holder Representative (the "") for resolution pursuant to this Section 1.6(f) and instruct the Accounting Referee to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of final determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness, as the case may be. In making such determination and calculations, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness as to which the Holder Representative has disagreed in writing. Buyer and the Holder Representative shall instruct the Accounting Referee

Accounting Referee
 
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Holder Representative and Buyer as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after submission) a report setting forth the Accounting Referee's calculation of the disputed amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Holder Representative, the Holders, the Company Warrant Holders, the holders of Company Options, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and the resulting Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness shall be final for all purposes of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be paid 50% by the Holders and 50% by Buyer; if the difference between the Buyer Adjustment Amount or Holder Adjustment Amount, as applicable, that would have resulted from the use of the proposed calculations of one of the parties hereto (the "") compared to the final determination of the Accounting Referee is more than twice as great as the difference between the Buyer Adjustment Amount or Holder Adjustment Amount, as applicable, that would have resulted from the use of the other party's proposed calculations compared to the final determination of the Accounting Referee, the Erroneous Party shall pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee. Buyer and the Holder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to withdraw from the Indemnification Escrow Amount the portion of such fees and expenses for which the Holders are responsible and Buyer and the Holder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to transfer such amount from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to Buyer.

All other trademarks and registered trademarks are property of their respective owners.
Certain fiscal 2012 reclassifications have been reflected retroactively to provide comparability.
(a) During the first quarter of 2012, Citrix reviewed the presentation of its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and adopted a revised presentation, which the company believes is more comparable to those presented by other companies in the industry. As a result, technical support, hardware maintenance and software updates revenues, which were previously presented in Technical Services and License Updates are classified together as License Updates and Maintenance. A corresponding change was made to rename Cost of Services Revenues to Cost of Services and Maintenance Revenues; however, there was no change in classification. Product training, certification and consulting services, which were previously presented in Technical Services, are classified together as Professional Services. Product Licenses has been renamed to Product and Licenses to more appropriately describe its composition of both software and hardware; however, there was no change in classification. The classification of Software as a Service remains unchanged. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the Company's total net revenues, total cost of net revenues or gross margin.
Conforming changes related to (a) have been made for the prior period presented, as follows:
(1) Technical services revenue was comprised of hardware maintenance, consulting services, product training and certification and technical support.
(2) License updates and maintenance is comprised of license updates, hardware and software maintenance and technical support.
(3) Professional services is comprised of consulting services and product training and certification.
(b) During the first quarter of 2012, Citrix revised its methodology for allocating certain IT support costs to more closely align these costs to the employees directly utilizing the related assets and services. As a result, certain IT support costs have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of services and maintenance revenues, research and development expenses and sales, marketing and services expenses based on the headcount in each of these functional areas. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the company's income from operations or cash flows. Conforming changes related to (b) have been made for the prior period presented, as follows:
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
 Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to newly acquired intangible assets , additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Certain fiscal 2012 reclassifications have been reflected retroactively to provide comparability.
(a) During the first quarter of 2012, Citrix reviewed the presentation of its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and adopted a revised presentation, which the company believes is more comparable to those presented by other companies in the industry. As a result, technical support, hardware maintenance and software updates revenues, which were previously presented in Technical Services and License Updates are classified together as License Updates and Maintenance. A corresponding change was made to rename Cost of Services Revenues to Cost of Services and Maintenance Revenues; however, there was no change in classification. Product training, certification and consulting services, which were previously presented in Technical Services, are classified together as Professional Services. Product Licenses has been renamed to Product and Licenses to more appropriately describe its composition of both software and hardware; however, there was no change in classification. The classification of Software as a Service remains unchanged. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the Company's total net revenues, total cost of net revenues or gross margin.
Conforming changes related to (a) have been made for the prior period presented, as follows:
(1) Technical services revenue was comprised of hardware maintenance, consulting services, product training and certification and technical support.
(2) License updates and maintenance is comprised of license updates, hardware and software maintenance and technical support.
(3) Professional services is comprised of consulting services and product training and certification.
(b) During the first quarter of 2012, Citrix revised its methodology for allocating certain IT support costs to more closely align these costs to the employees directly utilizing the related assets and services. As a result, certain IT support costs have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of services and maintenance revenues, research and development expenses and sales, marketing and services expenses based on the headcount in each of these functional areas. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the company's income from operations or cash flows. Conforming changes related to (b) have been made for the prior period presented, as follows:
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to newly acquired intangible assets , additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Certain fiscal year 2012 reclassifications have been reflected retroactively to provide comparability.
(a) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, Citrix reviewed the presentation of its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and adopted a revised presentation, which the company believes is more comparable to those presented by other companies in the industry. As a result, technical support, hardware maintenance and software updates revenues, which were previously presented in Technical Services and License Updates are classified together as License Updates and Maintenance. A corresponding change was made to rename Cost of Services Revenues to Cost of Services and Maintenance Revenues; however, there was no change in classification. Product training, certification and consulting services, which were previously presented in Technical Services, are classified together as Professional Services. Product Licenses has been renamed to Product and Licenses to more appropriately describe its composition of both software and hardware; however, there was no change in classification. The classification of Software as a Service remains unchanged. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the Company's total net revenues, total cost of net revenues or gross margin.
Conforming changes related to (a) have been made for the prior period presented, as follows:
(1) Technical services revenue was comprised of hardware maintenance, consulting services, product training and certification and technical support.
(2) License updates and maintenance is comprised of license updates, hardware and software maintenance and technical support.
(3) Professional services is comprised of consulting services and product training and certification.
(b) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, Citrix revised its methodology for allocating certain IT support costs to more closely align these costs to the employees directly utilizing the related assets and services. As a result, certain IT support costs have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of services and maintenance revenues, research and development expenses and sales, marketing and services expenses based on the headcount in each of these functional areas. This change in manner of presentation does not affect the company's income from operations or cash flows. Conforming changes related to (b) have been made for the prior periods presented, as follows:
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance.

 The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
 Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.

SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2013--Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ended March 31, 2013.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, Citrix achieved revenue of $673 million, compared to $589 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, representing 14 percent revenue growth.

Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $60 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 includes net tax benefits of approximately $9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $117 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $111 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.

Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to these items.
In spite of the macro factors negatively impacting IT spending, we executed well in Q1, said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. Consistently, CIOs everywhere tell me they are challenged by the transformation, consumerization and fragmentation taking place in computing. These forces are creating even more interest in mobility and cloud services.
We remain focused on our long-term strategy to help our customers as they invest in these areas.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization primarily related to newly acquired intangible assets, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.

After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise

Advance of Expenses

however
In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), even though less than a quorum, (b) if there are no such disinterested directors, or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, (c) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, or (d) the Delaware Court of Chancery.

The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation, Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the

Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
any), or a majority of the Board of Directors. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, who is present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting, and who complies with the notice procedures (including the procedures to update and supplement such notice) set forth in this Section 1.10. If the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if such stockholder has complied with the following procedures: (i) stockholder's written notice has been received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the later of (x) the close of business of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or (y) the close of business of the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting; (ii) such stockholder's written notice includes the information required to be provided in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10, and (iii) such stockholder has provided updates or supplements (if any) to such notice at the times and in the forms required by paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 1.10. For the avoidance of doubt, for a stockholder to bring nominations before a special meeting of stockholders, such stockholder must comply with the notice and other procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and this shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring such nominations properly before a special meeting.
C.
General
(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance herewith, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
(2) In no event shall the adjournment, postponement or rescheduling of any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice under this Section 1.10. For
 
purposes of this Section 1.10, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the stockholder meeting to present a nomination or any proposed business, such nomination or business shall be disregarded and shall not be brought before or voted on at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (C)(3) of Section 1.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of the stockholders.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to have proposals included in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor rule) under the Exchange Act and, to the extent required by such Rule, have such proposals considered and voted on at an annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances.
