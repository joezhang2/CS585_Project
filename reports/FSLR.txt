Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, ended December 30, 2006. Quarterly revenues were $52.7 million, up from $40.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and up from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 were $135.0 million, up from $48.1 million in fiscal year 2005.
PHOENIX, AZ  February 13, 2007
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $8.0 million or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis, compared to net income of $4.3 million or $0.06 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and a net loss of $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 or $(0.11) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis. Net income for fiscal 2006 was $4.0 million or $0.05 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis compared to a net loss of $6.5 million for fiscal 2005 or $(0.10) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Pro forma earnings per share have been adjusted for the three months ended December 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, to give effect to the Company's initial public offering as of the beginning of fiscal 2005. The pro forma earnings per share reflect the issuance of the Company's common stock in its initial public offering. The Company believes the pro forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior the Company's initial public offering.
 
On a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $0.12 per share, compared to $0.07 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $(0.14) per share on a GAAP fully diluted basis. Also on a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for fiscal 2006 was $0.07 per share compared to a net loss of $(0.13) per share for fiscal 2005.
"During the fourth quarter we recognized the full benefit of our Ohio expansion, resulting in 25MW of production at that plant during the quarter. The strong sequential increase in throughput reduced our manufacturing cost per watt to $1.25 for the fourth quarter, a 12% reduction from the third quarter of 2006. In addition, completion of our German manufacturing plant is on schedule, and the German plant will provide us with additional capacity to fulfill continued strong customer demand for our products," said Michael J. Ahearn, Chief Executive Officer of First Solar.
First Solar will discuss these results and expected results for fiscal 2007 in a conference call scheduled for today at 2:30 p.m. Mountain, or 4:30 p.m. EST. To participate in the conference call, please dial (800) 819-9193 or (913) 981-4911.

PHOENIX, AZ  May 3, 2007
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $5.0 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net income of $8.0 million or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and a net loss of $5.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 or $(0.08) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Pro-forma earnings per share for the three months ended December 30, 2006 and April 1, 2006 have been adjusted to give effect to the Company's equity offerings during 2006, including its initial public offering, as if each occurred on January 1, 2006. The Company believes the pro-forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior to the Company's initial public offering.

99.1 Press Release of First Solar dated November 7, 2007.
Table of Contents
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2007. Quarterly revenues were $159.0 million, up from $77.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and up from $40.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
PHOENIX, AZ  November 7, 2007
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $46.0 million or $0.58 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $44.4 million or $0.58 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and $4.3 million or $0.06 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
Net income for the third and second quarters of fiscal 2007 include one time tax benefits of $7.5 million, or $0.09 per fully diluted share and $39.2 million, or $0.51 per fully diluted share, respectively, due to the reversal of valuation allowances against previously established deferred tax assets in Germany and the United States, respectively.
Pro-forma earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2006 have been adjusted to give effect to the Company's equity offerings during 2006, including its initial public offering, as if each occurred on January 1, 2006. The Company believes the pro-forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior to the Company's initial public offering.
"The third quarter of 2007 concludes another important milestone in our mission towards grid parity. We successfully completed the ramp of our German production facility well ahead of schedule, which afforded us with highly leveraged growth during the quarter and provided our
 
customers with additional production volumes in a continued robust demand environment," said Mike Ahearn, chief executive officer and chairman of First Solar.
First Solar will discuss these results and expected results for fiscal 2007 and 2008 in a conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

News Release
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended, December 29, 2007. Quarterly revenues were $200.8 million, up from $159.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and up from $52.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 were $504.0 million, up from $135.0 million in fiscal year 2006.
PHOENIX, AZ  February 13, 2008
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $62.9 million or $0.77 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net income of $46.0 million or $0.58 per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 included a one time tax benefit of $7.5 million, or $0.09 per fully diluted share due to the reversal of valuation allowances against previously established deferred tax assets in Germany. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $8.0 million or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Net income for fiscal 2007 was $158.4 million or $2.03 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to net income of $4.0 million for fiscal 2006 or $0.05 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Pro-forma earnings per share for the three months and fiscal year ended, December 30, 2006, have been adjusted to give effect to the Company's equity offerings during 2006, including its initial public offering, as if each occurred on January 1, 2006. The Company believes the pro-forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior to the Company's initial public offering.
"During the fourth quarter of 2007 we benefited from the full capacity and economies of scale of our Frankfurt/Oder plant. This combined with continued throughput and conversion efficiency gains afforded us strong operating leverage and decreased our manufacturing cost per watt by 12% year over
 
year to $1.12 per watt in the fourth quarter of 2007, further solidifying our cost leadership position in the industry," said Michael J. Ahearn, Chief Executive Officer of First Solar.
First Solar will discuss these results and expected results for fiscal 2007 and 2008 in a conference call scheduled for today at 6:00 a.m. MST (8:00 a.m. EST). To participate in the conference call, please dial 800-896-8445 or 785-830-1916.

     On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion of First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar") in the Kulim Hi-Tech Park in the State of Kadah, Malaysia (the "Malaysia Project"), First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of First Solar ("FS Malaysia"), entered into an export financing facility agreement (the "Facility Agreement") with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, as arranger ("IKB"), NATIXIS Zweigniederlassung Deutschland, as facility agent and original lender ("NZD"), AKA Ausfuhrkredit-Gesellschaft mbH, as original lender ("AKA") and NATIXIS Labuan Branch, as security agent ("NLB"). Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement, the lenders will furnish up to 133,960,000 (or approximately $206,300,000) of credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities") consisting of: (1) five fixed rate euro denominated term loan facilities (the "Fixed Rate Credit Facilities") which have the following maximum aggregate amounts (a) 16,894,000 (or approximately $26,017,000), (b) 16,180,000 (or approximately $24,917,000), (c) 16,339,500 (or approximately $25,163,000), (d) 16,339,500 (or approximately $25,163,000) and (e) 1,227,000 (or approximately $1,890,000) and (2) five floating rate euro denominated term loan facilities (the "Floating Rate Credit Facilities") which have the following maximum aggregate amounts (a) 16,894,000 (or approximately $26,017,000), (b) 16,180,000 (or approximately $24,917,000), (c) 16,339,500 (or approximately $25,163,000), (d) 16,339,500 (or approximately $25,163,000) and (e) 1,227,000 (or approximately $1,890,000). The U.S. Dollar amounts referred to in this paragraph have been determined using an assumed exchange rate of 1.00/$1.54.
     The loans under the Fixed Rate Credit Facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to 4.54%. The loans under the Floating Rate Credit Facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 0.55%.
     The Credit Facilities are intended to be used by FS Malaysia for the purpose of (1) partially financing the purchase of certain equipment (the "Equipment") intended to be used at the plants related to the Malaysia Project (the "KLM Plants") and (2) financing fees to be paid to Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG ("Euler Hermes"), the German Export Credit Agency of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany that will guarantee FS Malaysia's obligations related to the Facility Agreement (the "Hermes Guarantee"). In addition, FS Malaysia's obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement (as defined below).
 
     The Facility Agreement requires FS Malaysia to make 14 semi-annual equal repayments of the total borrowings made under each Credit Facility. The first of these 14 semi-annual repayments with respect to each Credit Facility will commence on the earlier of (1) the day that is six months after the date that the KLM Plant to which such Credit Facility relates becomes ready for operation and (2) a specified date related to such Credit Facility, as such specified date for each Credit Facility is more particularly described in the Facility Agreement.
     Voluntary commitment cancellations of the Credit Facilities and prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities by FS Malaysia are permitted, in whole or in part, subject to minimum prepayment requirements and the payment of break costs. Subject to a limited exception, in the event that the Hermes Guarantee is (1) fully or partially withdrawn, or otherwise ceases to be in full force and effect or (2) repudiated by Euler Hermes (or its intention to repudiate is evidenced in writing), or if any of the obligations of Euler Hermes under the Hermes Guarantee ceases to be legal, valid, binding or in full force and effect, the loans made by any lender under any of the Credit Facilities may, at the direction of such lender, be declared immediately due and payable.
     FS Malaysia is obligated to pay commitment fees of 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the Fixed Rate Credit Facilities and 0.350% per annum on the unused portion of the Floating Rate Credit Facilities. In addition, FS Malaysia is obligated to pay certain underwriting, management and agency fees in connection with the Credit Facilities.
     The Facility Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, subject to limitations and exceptions, and customary covenants that, among other things and subject to limitations and exceptions, restrict FS Malaysia's ability to (1) encumber the Equipment, (2) sell, lease or transfer the Equipment, (3) make loans or guarantees, (4) change the general nature of its business, (5) amalgamate, merge or consolidate and (6) engage in transactions with affiliates. The Facility Agreement also contains financial covenants requiring FS Malaysia to maintain specified total debt to total equity, total debt to annualized EBITDA, interest coverage and debt service ratios.
     Events of default under the Facility Agreement include, but are not limited to, (1) FS Malaysia's failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts related to the Facility Agreement when due (taking into account any applicable grace period), (2) any representation or warranty proving to have been materially incorrect when made (taking into account any applicable grace period), (3) covenant defaults subject, with respect to certain covenants, to a grace period, (4) bankruptcy events, (5) a cross default to certain other debt, (6) a change of control of FS Malaysia or (7) any other circumstance occurs that has a material adverse effect, unless the facility agent is satisfied that First Solar will perform under the Guaranty Agreement and that such performance will be capable of remedying the material adverse effect. The Facility Agreement is governed by German law.
 
     In connection with the Facility Agreement, First Solar entered into a first demand guaranty agreement dated May 6, 2008 in favor of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement (the "Guaranty Agreement"). As stated above, FS Malaysia's obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement.
     In connection with the Facility Agreement, all of FS Malaysia's obligations related to the Facility Agreement are secured by a first party, first legal charge over the Equipment and the other documents, contracts and agreements related to the Equipment. Also in connection with the Facility Agreement, any payment claims of First Solar against FS Malaysia are subordinated to the claims of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement.
     The foregoing summary of the Facility Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of each of the Facility Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement, which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, hereto and incorporated into this report by reference.

(d) Exhibits.
99.1     Press Release of First Solar dated March 2, 2009.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 First Solar, Inc., (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced it has entered into an agreement to significantly expand its penetration within the U.S. utility solar power market with the acquisition of OptiSolar's solar project pipeline. The acquisition includes:
Tempe, Ariz.  March 2, 2009
First Solar expects to construct solar power plants developed under the acquired solar power project pipeline over the next several years and sell them to a combination of regulated utilities, diversified energy companies and other independent power producers.
First Solar's investment in the development pipeline and planned projects ensures that at least 400 new green collar jobs will be created in California. First Solar is committed to supporting the planned projects and will use its resources to bring these projects on-line on time. Project development is planned to begin as early as 2010.
The transaction represents another important step in First Solar's U.S. utility expansion.
In November 2007, First Solar acquired Turner Renewable Energy in order to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) capabilities of utility scale solar plants in the U.S. Since that time, First Solar has expanded its EPC function and successfully demonstrated its capabilities by constructing a 10MW AC plant in El Dorado, Nev., with Sempra Generation. In addition, in October of 2008, First Solar entered into a strategic agreement with Edison Mission Energy to develop and construct utility-scale solar generation in California. First Solar was awarded the first three projects in Southern California Edison's utility owned generation program. The current agreement will expand upon First Solar's development capabilities and significantly add to its generation project pipeline.
"OptiSolar has created an impressive and well-designed development pipeline. Adding these resources, along with their development team, to First Solar is our next logical step to delivering multi-GW of solar power to U.S. utilities over the next several years," said Mike Ahearn, First Solar chief executive officer. "As First Solar continues to drive down its
 
manufacturing and EPC costs, OptiSolar's project pipeline and the ability of our team to continually expand our existing pipeline, will enable us to bring solar energy on-line quickly and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the grid."
First Solar, which last week announced that it had broken the industry's long-standing $1 per watt price barrier, has steadily lowered its cost and expanded its manufacturing capacity since 2005. The Company will reach 1,100 MW manufacturing capacity in 2009, the equivalent generating capacity of an average-sized nuclear power plant. First Solar's strategy is to reduce the cost of solar electricity by driving higher throughput deployment of utility scale projects, which in turn enables economies of scale and rapid learning cycles.
"We are particularly excited to deploy utility-scale solar installations in California," Ahearn said. "The State of California has been a leader in solar technology and the Topaz project will be an important aspect of meeting the state's renewable goals."
"Combining the solar industry's cost-performance leader with a multi-gigawatt solar power project portfolio and the expertise of a world-class development team is a tremendous step forward for utility-scale PV solar generation," said Randy Goldstein, OptiSolar chief executive officer.
First Solar will acquire all of OptiSolar's project development business in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $400 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2009.
First Solar will host a conference call to discuss the acquisition announced today. The call will begin at 4:30 p.m. EST today, March 2, 2009. Please dial into the call at least 10 minutes prior to the start time. The conference call can be accessed by dialing (866) 225-4091 within the U.S. or +1 (703) 639-1128 outside the U.S. An audio replay of the conference call will also be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call. The audio replay will remain available until March 4, 2009 and can be accessed by dialing (888) 266-2081 for access within the U.S. or +1 (703) 925-2533 if you are calling from outside the U.S. and by entering access ID number 1339644.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On March 2, 2009, First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar") agreed to acquire the solar power project development business (the "Project Business") of OptiSolar Inc., a Delaware corporation ("OptiSolar"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among First Solar, OptiSolar, and OptiSolar Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("OptiSolar Holdings"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the closing date of the acquisition (the "Closing Date"), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of First Solar ("Merger Sub") will merge with and into OptiSolar, with OptiSolar surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Solar (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the Merger, all the outstanding shares of common stock of OptiSolar held by OptiSolar Holdings will be exchanged for the Merger Consideration (as defined below).
     The Merger Consideration will consist of shares of First Solar common stock ("First Solar Shares") having a value equal to (using the volume weighted average price of First Solar Shares for ten consecutive trading days for the period ending two trading days prior to the Closing Date) the sum of (a) $400 million, (b) the aggregate amount of certain payments made by OptiSolar from January 1, 2009 to the Closing Date in respect of the Project Business and (c) the amount held in certain accounts of OptiSolar's French subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. Forty percent of the First Solar Shares comprising the Merger Consideration will immediately be available for resale.
     A portion of the Merger Consideration (collectively, the "Holdback Shares") having a value equal to the sum of (a) certain accounts payable of OptiSolar and its subsidiaries and (b) the aggregate amount of rent due over the remaining terms of certain OptiSolar leases will not be issued to OptiSolar Holdings on the Closing Date. The Holdback Shares will only be issued to OptiSolar Holdings to the extent certain payments or novations are made in respect of such accounts payable or leases and only at specified times. If such payments or novations are not made within certain specified time periods after the Closing Date, all or a portion of the Holdback Shares will not be issued to OptiSolar Holdings.
     In addition, a portion of the Merger Consideration having a value equal to $100 million (the "Escrow Shares") will be deposited on the Closing Date with an escrow agent for a period of two years to support certain indemnification obligations of OptiSolar Holdings under the Merger Agreement. Up to twenty percent of the Escrow Shares may be released from the escrow on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.
     Prior to the Closing Date, OptiSolar will engage in a series of transactions (the "Spin Off Transactions") whereby (a) certain of OptiSolar's assets and liabilities not relating to the Project Business will be contributed to a new entity called OptiSolar Technologies Inc. ("OptiSolar Technologies"), (b) OptiSolar and OptiSolar Technologies will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of OptiSolar Holdings and (c) the current stockholders of OptiSolar will own 100% of the equity interest of OptiSolar Holdings. Pursuant to the Spin Off Transactions, OptiSolar Technologies and OptiSolar will agree to indemnify each other and various related parties for certain liabilities.
     The Merger Consideration will be issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be executed in connection with the Merger Agreement, First Solar will agree to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the resales of the shares issued to OptiSolar in the Merger (the "Resale Registration Statement").
     Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of legal impediments to the consummation of the transactions, the receipt of governmental approvals with respect to or the expiration or termination of any required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or other required foreign approvals, the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement and the quotation of the First Solar Shares comprising the Merger Consideration on the NASDAQ, and the consummation of the Spin Off Transactions. Concurrently with the execution and

Board of Directors Structure and Committee Composition
     Our board of directors is currently composed of eight directors: six independent directors and two executive directors, including the Chairman. We have three standing committees of the board: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and governance committee. The committee membership and meetings during 2008 and the function of each of the committees are described below.
     During 2008, the board of directors held eight meetings and acted by written consent once. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all board of directors meetings and committee meetings for the committees on which he serves.
Audit Committee
     The audit committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the board of directors and reports to the board of directors the results of these activities, including reviewing the systems of internal controls established by management, our audit and compliance process and financial reporting. The audit committee, among other duties, engages the independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm the plans and results of the audit engagement, considers the compatibility of any non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm with the independence of such independent registered public accounting firm and reviews the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. During 2008, the audit committee held six meetings.
     J. Thomas Presby (Chair), Craig Kennedy and Paul H. Stebbins serve on our audit committee. Each member of the audit committee meets the standards for financial knowledge for companies listed on NASDAQ. In addition, the board of directors has determined that Mr. Presby is qualified as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of Commission regulations.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Overview
     In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the individuals in the Summary Compensation Table set forth after this Compensation Discussion and Analysis are referred to as the "named executive officers." Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2008 are:
     The starting point for understanding our compensation decisions is the exponential growth our Company has experienced this year. We commenced production at two plants in Malaysia, surpassed 500 megawatts of production and proceeded apace with our expansion plans in our Kulim, Malaysia and Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facilities. We have also been integrating and developing the U.S. engineering, procurement and construction business we acquired at the end of 2007. By the end of 2008, we had more than doubled our global workforce as compared to fiscal 2007, including the addition of Messrs. Gaffney and Carrington, two of our named executive officers.
     As in years past, our compensation decisions continue to be grounded in our executive compensation policies described below. These policies are designed to attract, motivate and retain the individuals who can best help us to achieve our mission consistent with our core values. We continue to believe that our longterm success depends on our ability to continuously reduce solar electricity costs to expand global markets for solar electricity and extend our competitive cost advantage. This requires that we continue to discover, develop, commercialize and improve a stream of manufacturing process and product improvements; expand our sales and manufacturing volumes to realize economies of scale and cost reductions; and discover and penetrate new markets for solar electricity that extend beyond the traditional subsidydependent markets.
-
-
     A key challenge this year was the need to attract accomplished individuals capable of rapidly building the administrative infrastructure to support our growth. Not surprisingly, accomplished people are wellcompensated in their current roles and are unwilling to leave their current circumstances without recompense for what they leave behind. In the case of Mr. Gaffney (a former partner at the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP who was known to us because he served as a corporate legal advisor to the Estate of John T. Walton, our largest stockholder), and Mr. Carrington (an award winning former general manager and chief marketing officer for General Electric Plastics), we bridged the gap with signon bonuses paid in cash and equity awards.
-
-
     In 2008, we imposed additional metrics for our senior leadership team, including our named executive officers, in determining our annual bonus payment. As in 2007, the performance bonus of all of our associates, including the named executive officers, was determined based on the Company's performance on corporate operational metrics that are aligned with our 2008 annual operating plan. In addition, in 2008, we tied the bonus payment multiple of our senior leadership team to additional subjective and objective metrics that were tied to achievement of the Company's longterm strategy. The purpose of this structure was to keep the organization aligned on day-to-day operating metrics while making it more difficult for our executives to earn their full bonus potential if longterm strategic goals were not achieved. In 2008, this resulted in our senior executives, including our named executive officers, receiving an adjusted bonus multiplier of 1.0 their target bonus percentage while the rest of the organization earned a multiplier of 1.75 of their target bonus percentage.

-
     Finally, as described below in our discussion of employment agreements and change in control severance agreements, we amended all executive employment and change in control severance agreements primarily to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code").
Executive Compensation Policies
     Our long-term success depends on our ability to continuously reduce solar electricity costs in order to expand global markets for solar electricity and extend our addressable markets. This requires that we continue to discover, develop, commercialize and improve
 
a stream of manufacturing process and product improvements; expand our sales and manufacturing volumes to realize economies of scale and cost reductions; and discover and penetrate new markets for solar electricity that extend beyond the traditional subsidy-dependent markets. To execute these objectives rapidly and efficiently, it is critical that we attract, motivate and retain highly talented individuals who are committed to the Company's mission and core values at all levels of our organization.
     The compensation committee of our board of directors has responsibility for establishing and overseeing our compensation program as it applies to our executive officers. The compensation committee bases its executive compensation programs on the following policies:
     We generally do not adhere to rigid formulas or necessarily react to short-term changes in business performance in determining the amount and mix of compensation elements for our named executive officers. Generally, the types of compensation and benefits provided to the named executive officers are similar to those provided to other members of our senior leadership and other associates. When setting compensation, we review competitive compensation paid by other companies in the same or similar industries of comparable size and stage of development and where our compensation falls within the peer group. While we broadly aim to set our base salary and target bonus potential at approximately the 50th percentile of our peer group and to have our aggregate bonus and long-term incentives pay out, subject to individual and company performance between the 75th and 90th percentiles, we do not exclusively rely on market data to determine executive compensation. We incorporate flexibility into our compensation program and in our assessment process to respond to and adjust for the evolving business environment in which we operate.
Components of Executive Compensation for 2008
     For 2008, the compensation of named executive officers consisted of three principal components: base salary, cash incentive compensation (e.g., an annual bonus) and equity-based compensation. Our named executive officers also participate in broad based employee benefit programs and are party to employment agreements and change in control agreements which provide them with certain additional benefits (including severance and equity vesting acceleration in exchange for a release and a non-compete covenant) in certain circumstances described in more detail in "Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements" and "Executive CompensationChange of Control Severance Agreements." Each of these elements of our executive compensation is described below, including a description of the particular element and how it fits into our overall executive compensation package. In the descriptions, we highlight the particular objectives and the specific elements our compensation programs are designed to address. However, it should be noted that we have designed our program so that each of the principal components complements the other. In particular, for the named executive officers (those at the highest level in our organization), we have elected to provide them with substantially more than half of their compensation in the form of short-term (cash) and long-term (equity) incentives (i.e., linked to Company performance and stockholder returns) because they are better able to affect the Company's results.
 
     Below is a chart demonstrating, on an aggregate basis, the relative weighting of 2008 compensation to our named executive officers, excluding the value of severance and change in control benefits, which are described in more detail at "Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements and Arrangements" and "Executive CompensationPotential Payments upon Termination or Change of ControlPotential Payments upon Termination of Employment (Other Than in the Context of a Change of Control) and excluding the value of one-time hiring grants of cash and equity, which are described in more detail at "Components of CompensationSign-On Bonuses."
Compensation Committee Practices
Total Compensation Review
     When establishing total compensation, we broadly aim to set our base salary and target bonus potential at approximately the 50th percentile of our peer group and to have our aggregate bonus and long-term incentives pay out, subject to individual and company performance, between the 75th and 90th percentiles. On an annual basis, the compensation committee evaluates the total compensation of the executives and each of the principal components against that objective. In addition to these principal compensation elements, the compensation committee reviews each executive's perquisites and other compensation, as well as any payments that would be required under various severance and change-in-control scenarios. When conducting this review, the compensation committee obtains factual data from management as well as proposals regarding, among other things, the range of values (merit increase percentages, equity awards), metrics and other terms. In 2008, the Company retained a consultant to benchmark the compensation of each of the components of our executive officers and non-associate directors against the compensation paid to similarly situated positions at a peer group of companies. The consultant's services were limited to comparing each element of compensation for a particular position against similar elements in the peer group. The peer group for benchmarking (which was first developed in 2007) consisted of the following 34 companies in the solar, renewable energy, hi-tech and high precision manufacturing, and electronic components manufacturing sectors with revenues ranging from $70 million to $9.7 billion, with whom the Company competes for talent.
 
     When performing the benchmarking for executive compensation, the consultant "size adjusted" the raw market data by using statistical regression techniques to remove the significant swings that can occur between individual raw data points and constructed market pay levels reflective of the Company's adjusted size. The consultant then ran regressions using sales to develop a range of market-based pay for the top executives on total compensation as a whole and on base salary, annual bonus, and equity-based compensation separately. The consultant's report supported the determination that the compensation paid to the Company's executives, including its named executive officers, was consistent with the Company's stated compensation objectives, and thus, reasonable in the aggregate.
Individual Compensation Review
     Individual performance has a strong impact on the compensation of all associates, including the chief executive officer and the other executive officers. With respect to the chief executive officer, the independent directors, under the direction of the chair of the compensation committee, meet with the chief executive officer in an executive session annually at the beginning of the year to agree upon the chief executive officer's performance objectives (both individual and Company objectives) for the year. At the end of the year, the independent directors meet in an executive session under the direction of the chair of the compensation committee to conduct a performance review of the chief executive officer based on his achievement of the agreed-upon objectives, contribution to the Company's performance and other leadership accomplishments. This evaluation is shared with the chief executive officer by the chair of the compensation committee and is provided to the compensation committee for its consideration in setting each element of the chief executive officer's compensation. For the other executive officers, including the other named executive officers, the compensation committee receives a performance assessment and compensation recommendation from the chief executive officer and also exercises its judgment based on the board's interactions with the executive officer. As with the chief executive officer, the performance evaluation of these executives is based on achievement of preset objectives by the executive and his or her organization, his or her contribution to the Company's performance and other leadership accomplishments. Based on these considerations, the compensation committee determines whether to award variable compensation to the chief executive officer and the executive officers for the previous year and sets the base salary for the coming year for the chief executive officer and the other executive officers, the performance objectives for the chief executive officer and the parameters for the corporate goals for the Company generally.
Compensation Considerations by Compensation Elements
     The following is a summary of objectives of the primary components of our executive compensation.
 
     The following is a discussion of the compensation committee's considerations in establishing each of the components for the executive officer compensation for 2008.
Base Salary
     Base salary is the guaranteed element of an associate's annual cash compensation. The value of base salary for each named executive officer reflects the requirements of such executive's employment agreement, their individual performance and their skill set, including the market value of that skill set. For details relating to the employment agreements, see "Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements and Arrangements." In general, the Company sought to establish or maintain base salaries for 2008 at or around market (50th percentile of our peer group) base salary levels for each of the named executive officers. As discussed under our compensation objectives, we believe that as associates progress to higher levels in the organization, a greater proportion of overall compensation should be directly linked to Company performance and stockholder returns. First Solar is a hardworking company in a dynamic industry where daily activities routinely require extraordinary effort. Establishing the fixed portion of our compensation at or around the 50th percentile of our peer group allows us to weight a higher percentage of total compensation on performance-based compensation. The compensation committee currently intends to maintain the base salaries of its named executive officers at approximately market base salary levels in the future.
     As discussed above in "Compensation Committee PracticesTotal Compensation Review," in 2008, the Company retained a consultant to benchmark the compensation of our executive officers (including our named executive officers then employed by the Company). After reviewing this data and evaluating individual performance, the compensation committee adjusted the base pay of certain executive officers, including an increase in base salary for Mr. Ahearn, from $450,000 to $525,000; for Mr. Sohn from $375,000 to $412,500; and for Mr. Meyerhoff, from $360,000 to $376,200.
Cash Incentive Compensation
     We use cash incentive compensation to reward achievement of our annual operational and strategic objectives. When taken together with our base salary, our total annual cash compensation is in the broad middle range of our peer group if target performance is attained but can be above that range due to higher payouts under the annual bonus plan if our performance exceeds our targets.
Annual Bonus
     The annual bonus program provides "cash incentive awards" under the Company's 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. The bonuses paid for 2008 to named executive officers appear in the Summary Compensation Table under the "NonEquity Incentive Plan Compensation" column. Because all our associates participate in the annual bonus program, the program is designed to encourage teamwork and a focus on our mutual success by tying rewards to our collective performance. In 2008, we added an additional performance hurdle element applicable only to our senior leadership team, including all of our named executive officers, based on achievement of enumerated strategic objectives. Bonuses for 2008 were prorated for named executive officers, and for other associates, if they were not employed by the Company for the full fiscal year.
-
     The target bonus percentages for 2008 (which are expressed as a percentage of a base salary) were established based on job responsibilities, internal relativity and peer group data. Our objective was to set bonus targets such that total annual cash compensation (salary and annual bonus) are within the broad middle range of peer group companies. Consistent with our executive compensation policy, individuals with greater job responsibilities had a greater proportion of their total cash compensation tied to Company performance through the bonus program. As discussed above in "Compensation Committee PracticesTotal Compensation Review" in 2008, the Company retained a consultant to benchmark the compensation of our executive officers (including our named executive officers). This evaluation included a separate evaluation of the target annual bonus component of total compensation. After reviewing all of the factors, and as permitted under the Company's 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, the compensation committee adjusted the target bonus percentage of certain executive officers, including an increase in the target bonus percentage for Mr. Ahearn, from 85% to 100%; for Mr. Sohn from 70% to 80%; and for Mr. Meyerhoff, from 60% to 70%. The target bonus percentage for each of Mr. Gaffney and Mr. Carrington is 80%. With the exception of Mr. Ahearn's employment agreement, the target bonus percentages are incorporated into the terms of the executives' employment agreements. For Mr. Ahearn, the compensation committee retained the contractual authority to establish the terms of his annual bonus (including the target bonus percentage) each year. See "Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements and Arrangements."
 
Annual Bonus Targets
     The performance measures used to measure attainment of bonus eligibility for the named executive officers were based on a combination of annual operational objectives and long-term strategic objectives, as described below. We have not disclosed the specific targets we used for our annual operational objectives and our long-term strategic objectives because they go to the heart of our proprietary business plan and we believe doing so would cause competitive harm.
     For all associates, including the named executive officers, the compensation committee assessed Company performance based on accomplishment of certain operational objectives established at the beginning of 2008. The objectives were based on operating goals set forth in our confidential annual operating plan for production volume, module conversion efficiency, watts per module, cost per watt, total watts sold and plant expansion and organizational buildout. Each operational objective was assigned a percentage weighting based on the importance of the factor to the overall performance of the Company. In addition, each operational metric had a target goal with higher targets (or stretch targets) that would result in multipliers between 1.0 and 2.0, and a minimum threshold for each metric which would result in multipliers between 0.5 and 1.0 times, to the metric's weighting. A 1.0 multiplier was assigned to performance at a level that, while not certain at the time targets were set, we expected we could and should be able to achieve by the end of the year. A 2.0 multiplier was assigned to a performance level that was substantially more uncertain (i.e., that we expected we would have only a 50% chance of achieving by year end). If the minimum threshold level of performance was not achieved, the multiplier for the metric was zero. In 2008, the target bonus percentage multiplier for the 2008 operational objectives was calculated at 1.75 because we achieved or substantially exceeded the target metrics on all six performance metrics.
2008 Operational Objectives.
-
     For the Company's senior executive leadership only (including the named executive officers), the compensation committee assessed the Company's achievement of two strategic objectives which we refer to as the Senior Leadership Strategic Objectives. These strategic objectives were established at the beginning of 2008 at the same time as the 2008 operational objectives. The purpose of the Senior Leadership Strategic Objectives was to ensure that the Company continues to make progress on its long-term objectives in addition to achieving the annual operating goals. The strategic objectives were (i) achieving sufficient progress on the Company's cost efficiency initiatives, and (ii) completion of over one hundred other enumerated corporate strategic and tactical goals. The enumerated corporate goals were each placed in one of three equally weighted categories: (1) critical to the business, (2) essential for growth and (3) related to core values. On the second metric (i.e., the enumerated corporate goals), partial credit was given for partial completion of the corporate goals so long as the corporate goals were achieved at a predetermined threshold level. The highest multiplier for achievement of both strategic objectives was 1.0, which equated to 100% of the bonus percentage payable to all associates. The multiplier for partial attainment of the strategic objectives could be as low as 0.165%. Evaluation of the accomplishment and performance level of progress toward cost efficiency initiatives and the enumerated corporate goals was based on a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis. In 2008, the multiplier for the strategic objectives was determined to be .50.
Senior Leadership Strategic Objectives.
     The calculated target bonus percentage multiplier for the senior leadership team was .875. That is 1.75 (based on achievements of the corporate organizational objectives) multiplied by .5 (based on achievement of the strategic objectives). However, in reviewing the 2008 results, the compensation committee approved management's recommendation to adjust the target bonus multiplier to 1.0 based on the compensation committee's determination that the calculated multiplier did not adequately capture progress made by management during 2008 in meeting the Company's cost-efficiency initiatives.
 
     The chart below illustrates in graphic form how the annual bonus was calculated in 2008 for our senior leadership team including our named executive officers, using a hypothetical base salary and target bonus percentage.
     
Equity-Based Compensation
     We are a firm proponent of equity-based compensation because we believe that (i) offering equity-based compensation aligns the interests of our associates more closely with those of our stockholders, and (ii) for some positions (particularly executive level positions), offering equity-based compensation is key to attracting and retaining associates of the highest caliber. Every associate of the Company is granted equity compensation when hired, with the amount dependent on (i) the associate's job responsibilities (recognizing that higher level roles may have a greater influence on the ability of the Company to meet its objectives and succeed), (ii) for current associates, the associate's individual performance (associates must maintain a certain performance level to receive an equity grant), and (iii) the region where the associate is located (so that the amount is reflective of the compensation practices particular to the region). In addition, certain associates receive annual equity compensation grants as part of their annual compensation. The annual grant was made in April 2008 as described below. Grants made to the named executive officers are more particularly described in the "Grants of Plan Based Awards" table and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table.
     Equity-based compensation granted to new associates, typically restricted stock units but occasionally stock options, is granted in accordance with our 2006 Omnibus Plan, and any options are issued with exercise prices no less than fair market value as of the date of grant. Some associates, including some of our named executive officers, still hold outstanding option grants granted under the First Solar Holdings, LLC 2003 Unit Option Plan. Since the adoption of the 2006 Omnibus Plan, we have not granted, nor do we anticipate granting, any awards outside of the 2006 Omnibus Plan, including any further awards under the 2003 Plan. Our practice is not to time the date of awards made under the 2006 Omnibus Plan.
     In 2008, our equity-based compensation grants consisted primarily of grants of restricted stock units. In April 2008, we granted an aggregate of 182,961 restricted stock units under the 2006 Omnibus Plan (which represents approximately 0.22% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of December 27, 2008) to 444 associates, including Messrs. Ahearn, Meyerhoff and Sohn, representing approximately 21.7% of our associates at the time of the grant (Messrs. Gaffney and Carrington, who each received new hire equity grants, did not receive an April 2008 grant). Equity grants to our named executive officers are more particularly described in the "Grants of Plan Based Awards" table and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table. The restricted stock units granted in April 2008 vest over four years 20%, 20%, 20% and 40%, respectively, on the anniversary of the grant date, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with us.
 
     In deciding to make a broad based restricted stock unit grant we considered many factors including:
     (i)  We revisited and reconfirmed that we wanted to make grants to all exempt associates in the United States (including those named executive officers then employed by the Company) and to equivalent job categories outside of the United States.
Eligibility Pool
     (ii)  We chose restricted stock units over options for competitive reasons (i.e., market data indicates that hi-tech companies were moving from options to restricted stock units) and because restricted stock units provide a more meaningful benefit in today's economic environment than stock options as stock market volatility can quickly cause options to go underwater.
Form of Equity Compensation
     (iii)  We gave serious consideration to whether to adopt performance vesting for restricted stock units, particularly for our senior leadership team, however we declined to adopt it. Given the multi-year period over which we would expect the restricted stock units to vest, and the dynamic nature of our industry, we could not comfortably identify a long-term value creation metric that we could assure would be meaningful throughout the vesting period. We will revisit this in 2009. In lieu of adopting performance vesting, we decided at the time of our April 2008 grant to begin adding performance concepts into the equity compensation component by multiplying 50% of the target equity compensation grant to be made in 2009 by the senior leadership bonus multiplier used to determine the 2008 annual bonus. Because the 2008 multiplier was determined to be 1.0, it will not have an impact on 2009 equity compensation grants made to the senior leadership team in 2009.
Performance Vesting
     (iv)  In determining the amount to be granted to each associate, we referenced the peer group compensation surveys described above in "Compensation Committee PracticesTotal Compensation Review" with respect to levels of equity-based performance compensation and established a target grant for each salary grade equal to approximately the 50th percentile for the equity component of compensation. Individual performance was then assessed to determine whether adjustments to the proposed restricted stock unit grant were appropriate based on the associate's performance in 2007. The assessment of individual performance included reference to each executive's objectives set at the beginning of the year and his or her general performance and effectiveness in achieving corporate objectives. The objectives set for associates, including the named executive officers, may have had quantitative as well as qualitative objectives that would reflect the associate's expected contribution to helping the Company achieve its objectives.
Amount
     For the executive officers, including the named executive officers, the chief executive officer made recommendations to the compensation committee on the level of their restricted stock grants with regard to the benchmarking data, the role and responsibility of the associate and their individual performance. The compensation committee then assessed the performance of the chief executive officer and the named executive officers in approving the annual component of their long-term incentive compensation.
     
Sign-On Bonuses
     For certain roles we have granted individual incentives or sign-on bonuses to attract the associate to the Company. Often the sign-on bonus is necessary to compensate an associate for the compensation from a prior employer he or she must forfeit to join First Solar. This was the case for Mr. Gaffney (who gave up a partnership at New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, LLP, from which he had substantial compensation and benefit entitlements) and Mr. Carrington (who forfeited certain equity compensation from General Electric, his former employer), the two named executive officers hired in 2008.
     In 2008, we agreed to pay Mr. Gaffney a $7.0 million sign-on bonus. The bonus is payable in 20 equal quarterly installments, commencing on March 31, 2008. Payment of the sign-on bonus is subject to Mr. Gaffney's continued employment. However, if Mr. Gaffney's employment is terminated without cause, his payments will continue on the same schedule until completed. In addition, we made a hiring grant to Mr. Gaffney of (i) 100,000 stock options with an exercise price of $267.14, which is scheduled to vest in five equal annual installments commencing on December 31, 2008, subject to Mr. Gaffney's continued employment with us, and (ii) 26,203 restricted stock units, which is scheduled to vest quarterly in 20 equal installments, subject to Mr. Gaffney's continued employment. If Mr. Gaffney's employment is terminated without cause, he will become 100% vested in his new hire equity grants. Mr. Gaffney's new hire equity grants also become 100% vested upon a change in control of the Company.
 
     In 2008, Mr. Carrington received a lump sum cash sign-on bonus equal to $150,000, which was paid when he joined the Company as well as a hiring grant of 17,500 restricted stock units, scheduled to vest over four years commencing on the anniversary of the grant date and each anniversary thereafter at a rate of 20% per year for the first three years and 40% for the last year, subject to Mr. Carrington's continued employment with us. If Mr. Carrington's employment is terminated without cause, Mr. Carrington will receive an additional 12 months' vesting of his new hire equity grant. The new hire equity grant also becomes 100% vested upon a change in control of the Company.
     The equity compensation related sign-on bonuses were made pursuant to and under the 2006 Omnibus Plan.
     
Broad-based Benefits Programs and Other Compensation
     Our named executives are entitled to participate in the various benefits programs we offer to all of our associates, including a 401(k) plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan and long-term and short-term disability plans. Under our 401(k) plan, we make a matching contribution equal to 50% of our associate's contributions to the Plan up to a maximum of 4% of an associate's Plan compensation, such that in 2008 an associate was required to contribute at least 8% of Plan compensation in order to receive the full matching contribution. Effective January 1, 2009, we amended the Plan to provide for a matching contribution equal to 100% of our associate's contributions to the Plan up to a maximum of 4% of an associate's Plan compensation, such that in 2009 an associate need only contribute 4% of Plan compensation in order to receive the full matching contribution. In 2008, Messrs. Meyerhoff, Sohn and Gaffney each received the maximum matching contribution of $7,750; Mr. Carrington received $4,310; and Mr. Ahearn did not participate in the plan.

     Our named executive officers each have vacation entitlements of four weeks per year. For certain of our executives who relocated when they joined the Company, we make payments related to their relocation which are grossed-up. In 2008, we made such payments to Mr. Carrington and Mr. Sohn. These payments are described in more detail under the "Summary Compensation Table."
Other Benefits.
Employment Agreements
     We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives, including each of our named executive officers, with the goal of clarifying their terms of employment and eliminating future disagreement regarding their employment terms. When we have entered into such employment agreements with our executives, it has been the compensation committee's judgment that such agreements were appropriate and necessary. The employment agreements generally provide for base salary, bonus, benefits and eligibility for equity-based compensation awards, as well as rights to certain payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment. This year each of the employment agreements was amended where necessary, to update compensation terms (e.g., base salary, bonus), delete obsolete provisions, standardize like provisions and bring them into compliance with section 409A of the Code. In addition, for all named executive officers (other than with respect to Mr. Gaffney's new hire equity grant and Mr. Carrington, whose agreement already provided this protection), the employment agreements were revised to provide that should their employment terminate due to death or disability, then upon such termination of employment they would be vested in an additional 12 months' equity-based compensation (i.e., the equity-based compensation that would have vested within the 12 month period). We note that this is the same amount of additional vesting that applies in the event of an executive's employment termination without cause.
     For more details on these employment agreements and the compensation and benefits payable or to be provided in the event of a termination of employment, see "Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements and Arrangements" and "Executive CompensationPotential Payments upon Termination or Change of ControlPotential Payments upon Termination of Employment (Other Than in the Context of a Change of Control)."
     
Change of Control Severance Agreements
     We have previously entered into change in control severance agreements ("CIC Agreements") with our named executive officers and certain other key officers and employees, which were all amended in 2008 to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The purpose of these agreements, which are substantially identical, is to align the interest of the executives with our stockholders in any potential change of control situation by mitigating the uncertainty and questions a potential change in control may raise among such executives and employees and allowing them to focus their continued attention and dedication to their assigned duties. The CIC Agreements also provide for "single trigger" vesting of unvested equity-based compensation upon a change in control of the Company thereby ensuring that such executives and employees are fairly compensated for the lost opportunity to realize the value of awards that is typically precipitated by a change in control. When the Company originally entered into the CIC Agreements, the compensation committee reviewed the terms of the CIC Agreements in consultation with an independent consultant, assessed the impact of possible payouts under the CIC Agreements in the event of a change in control and concluded that the CIC Agreements were fair and reasonable. The 2008 amendments do not change the financial terms of the CIC Agreements. For a further description of compensation provided in the event of a change of control, see "Executive CompensationPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change of ControlPotential Payments upon a Change of Control."
 
Tax and Accounting Implications
     With certain exceptions, Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deductibility of compensation paid by a public company in any year to $1 million to each of the chief executive officer and the next three most highly paid executive officers other than the chief financial officer. A transition rule generally applies to compensation paid under plans and arrangements in existence on the date of an initial public offering, pursuant to which such compensation will not be subject to the $1 million limit. The Company generally endeavors to avail itself of this transition rule, and expects this transition rule to continue to apply to amounts paid or awards granted until 2010. However, the Committee has not adopted a policy that all compensation must be deductible, particularly where additional compensation may be needed to attract executives to key leadership positions in the Company. Certain sign-on compensation for Mr. Gaffney will not be deductible.
Section 
162(m)
of the Code.
     Section 280G of the Code denies a tax deduction on certain compensation payments to any "disqualified individual" (which term includes our named executive officers) that are contingent upon a "change in ownership or control" of the Company. A tax deduction for compensation in excess of the disqualified individual's average taxable compensation is denied, but only if the total change in control payments equal or exceed three times the individual's average taxable compensation (i.e., the 280G limit). In addition, if the threshold is exceeded, a 20% excise tax is imposed on the "disqualified individual" under Section 4999 of the Code. The Company has entered into change in control severance agreements with certain executive officers, including each of the named executive officers that provides for the Company to gross-up such executive officer for the 20% excise tax to the extent that the applicable compensation exceeds 110% of the 280G limit (payments will be cut back to less than the 280G limit if the 110% threshold is not exceeded). The Company has estimated the parachute payments that would have been payable had a change of control occurred and named executive officer's employment been terminated on December 27, 2008. See "Executive CompensationPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change of ControlPotential Payments upon a Change of Control." As of that date, we estimated that Messrs. Ahearn and Carrington were the only named executive officers who would have had payments subject to tax gross up and deduction disallowance.
Section 280G of the Code.
     The Company uses Financial Accounting Standard 123R for purposes of determining the fair value of its equity-based compensation. The assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 17, "Share-based Compensation" to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2008 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on February 25, 2009.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment (Other Than in the Context of a Change of Control)
     The table below reflects the estimated amount of compensation payable to each of the named executive officers of the Company in the event of termination of such executive's employment. The amount of compensation payable to each named executive officer upon voluntary termination without good reason, voluntary termination with good reason, involuntary termination without cause, termination with cause in the event of disability or death of the executive, in each case, other than in connection with a change in control, is shown below. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 27, 2008, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. For purposes of the calculations below, we have used a share value of $135.01 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on December 26, 2008. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from the Company.
     For descriptions relating to these payments and benefits, including any release, non-competition, non-solicitation or similar requirements, see "Employment Agreements and Arrangements." The amounts do not include amounts payable pursuant to the Company's contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive officers of the Company and that are available generally to all salaried associates, including payment of accrued rights such as payment for accrued and unpaid vacation.
 
 
Potential Payments upon a Change of Control
Consequences of Change of Control under Equity-Based Compensation Plans
     The 2006 Omnibus Plan provides that, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, in the event of a change of control (as defined below) of the Company, unless provision is made in connection with the change of control for assumption of, or substitution for, awards previously granted, any equity awards outstanding as of the date the change of control is determined to have occurred will become fully exercisable and vested, as of immediately prior to the change of control, and cash incentive awards will be paid out as if the change of control date were the last day of the performance period and assuming target level of performance and all other awards will be deemed exercisable.
2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan.
     The term "change of control" in the 2006 Omnibus Plan is defined as the occurrence of any of the following events:
     The 2003 Plan permits the Company to accelerate the exercisability and vesting of options in the event of a change in control, but does not require the Company to do so.
2003 Unit Option Plan.
Change in Control Severance Agreements
     The Company has entered into change in control severance agreements, referred to as the CIC Agreements, with its executive officers and certain senior management, including each of its named executive officers. Under the CIC Agreements, if a change in
 
control (substantially as defined in the 2006 Omnibus Plan) occurs, the executive would become immediately entitled to accelerated vesting of all equity-based, long-term incentive and cash incentive compensation awards (other than awards which by their express terms do not accelerate under the CIC Agreements).
     Executives who are party to a CIC Agreement will also be entitled to severance payments and benefits if the executive's employment with the Company is terminated in anticipation of a change in control or if, during the two-year period after a change in control, the executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive resigns for good reason (which includes material changes in an executive's duties, responsibilities or reporting relationships, failure to provide equivalent compensation and benefits and being required to relocate 50 or more miles) (such termination, a "qualifying termination"). If terminated or separated from the Company under those circumstances, the executive would be entitled to the following additional benefits under the CIC Agreement:
     To obtain severance benefits under a CIC Agreement, an executive must first execute a separation agreement with the Company that includes a waiver and release of any and all claims against the Company. For terminations other than a qualifying termination following a change in control, the executive is entitled to accrued rights only.
     In addition to the foregoing, in accordance with the CIC Agreements, the Company will make certain tax "gross-up" payments to the executive to cover excise taxes that may be imposed under Section 280G of the Code in connection with qualifying termination payments (including the acceleration of equity-based, long-term incentive and cash compensation upon a change in control) unless the value of the payments and benefits in connection with the change in control does not exceed by more than 10% of the maximum amount payable without triggering any such taxes, in which case the payments and benefits will be reduced to such maximum amount.
     The table below shows the amounts that would be payable to each of the named executive officers in the event of a qualifying termination following a change in control, if a change of control and the qualifying termination had occurred on December 27, 2008, using a $135.01 per share closing price.
     The amounts do not include amounts payable pursuant to the Company's contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive officers of the Company and that are available generally to all salaried associates, including payment of accrued rights such as payment for accrued and unpaid vacation.
 
 
     We use a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our board of directors. The table below summarizes the 2008 Non-Associate Director Compensation.
     When reviewing non-associate director compensation we are guided by three goals, as provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines: (i) compensation should fairly pay directors for work required for a company of our size and scope; (ii) compensation should align directors' interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders; and (iii) the structure of the compensation should be clearly disclosed to our stockholders.
     In 2008, the Company retained a consultant to compare our non-associate director compensation to the compensation paid to non-associate directors of the peer group described in "Compensation Committee Practices  Total Compensation Review" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. When performing the benchmarking, the consultant compared total non-associate director compensation, as well as customary elements of such compensation, including annual retainers, meeting fees, equity and committee retainers, against the total compensation and elements of the peer group companies. The consultant determined that the Company's total non-associate director compensation, as well as its elements, was substantially below the average market value of the non-director compensation for the peer group. Following the consultant's report, the compensation committee adopted the increase to the compensation of non-associate director compensation described below beginning in 2009
.
Cash Compensation
     For 2008, our non-associate directors received annual compensation of a $50,000 cash retainer (in four equal installments payable quarterly) and were not paid any fees for attending board meetings or committee meetings. Beginning in 2009, the annual cash retainer increased to $75,000, and the chairman of our audit committee will receive an additional $35,000 cash retainer (in four equal installments payable quarterly).
Equity Compensation
     For 2008, we compensated our independent directors with a $50,000 stock grant, payable in four equal installments payable quarterly. The chairman of the audit committee also received an additional annual $25,000 stock grant, in four equal installments payable quarterly. With respect to such quarterly stock grants, our practice is to issue the stock at the end of the quarter to our independent directors. Our practice is not to time the date of these awards, and we do not take account of any internal "black outs," during which associates and directors are prohibited by our Insider Trading Policy from trading in our securities, or whether we are or are not in possession of undisclosed material facts and without regard to whether any undisclosed material facts could be perceived as potentially positive or negative. Beginning in 2009, the annual stock grant to our independent directors increased to $75,000; however, the chairman of the audit committee will no longer receive an additional annual stock grant.
Other
     We reimburse all directors for reasonable and necessary expenses they incur in performing their duties as directors of the Company.

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
     On April 3, 2009, First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar") completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business (the "Project Business") of OptiSolar Inc., a Delaware corporation ("OptiSolar"). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated as of March 2, 2009 by and among First Solar, First Solar Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), OptiSolar and OptiSolar Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("OptiSolar Holdings"), Merger Sub merged with and into OptiSolar, with OptiSolar surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Solar (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the Merger, all the outstanding shares of common stock of OptiSolar held by OptiSolar Holdings were exchanged for the Merger Shares (as defined below).
     The Merger Shares consist of 2,972,420 shares of First Solar common stock, including (i) 732,789 shares that have been deposited with an escrow agent to support certain indemnification obligations, and (ii) 355,096 shares that may be issued upon satisfaction of conditions relating to the satisfaction of certain existing liabilities of OptiSolar (the "Holdback Shares").
      The Merger Shares were issued, and any Holdback Shares will be issued, in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). First Solar has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of 2,801,435 of the Merger Shares.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
      The information included in Item 3.02 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01. On April 3, 2009, First Solar issued a press release announcing completion of the acquisition of the Project Business. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Exhibit 99.1
Press Release
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of OptiSolar's photovoltaic project pipeline. First Solar expects to construct the solar power plants developed under the pipeline over the next several years and sell them to a combination of regulated utilities, diversified energy companies and other independent power producers.
Tempe, Ariz.  April 3, 2009
In addition, the core development team responsible for assembling and executing on the solar project pipeline has joined the First Solar development team. First Solar acquired all of OptiSolar's project development business in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $400 million. As a result of the closing today, First Solar will issue approximately 3 million shares of common stock representing a dilution of about 3.5 percent. This is less than the approximate 5 percent dilution expected when the acquisition was announced, due to recent appreciation in the price of shares of the Company's common stock.

News Release
 
 
First Solar, Inc. announced today that it has initiated a process to recruit its next chief executive officer to succeed Michael Ahearn.   Upon selection of a new chief executive officer, Ahearn will continue to serve in the full-time position of executive chairman. In this role Ahearn will focus his efforts at First Solar on the development of public policies needed for the global transition to low-carbon energy infrastructures.
TEMPE, ARIZ.  Apr 29, 2009 
We are rapidly reaching the point where the evolution of the energy industry will be constrained not by technology or product costs, but rather by policies, programs and institutions that cannot adapt rapidly to the innovations that are occurring in clean energy, said Ahearn. Given First Solars leadership position in the industry, I believe we are in a unique position to make a valuable contribution to those policy discussions. This will require virtually full-time focus from the very top of the organization. As a major shareholder and founder of the Company, I remain committed to its success.
The Company has initiated an external search for a new chief executive officer, led by a committee of the Board of Directors. The Board intends to run a thorough and deliberate process designed to identify and recruit a candidate consistent with specific criteria developed with the existing management team and required to lead the Company in executing its long term strategic plan.

Exhibit 99.1
TEMPE, Arizona, Sept. 7, 2009  In an exceptional visit to the United States, a delegation of senior Chinese government leaders  today visited First Solar (NASDAQ: FLSR) headquarters in Tempe to learn first-hand how the company's low-cost solar technology can help contribute to Chinas goal of achieving a low-carbon economic future as well as meeting Chinas increasing demand for sustainable renewable energy.
Hosted by First Solar CEO Mike Ahearn, the delegation led by Chairman Wu Bangguo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China met with First Solar executives to examine the companys industry-leading solar panels.  The officials also discussed the significant potential for the U.S. and China to address global climate change through the creation of solar markets that take advantage of the significant solar resources in both countries.
If the U.S. and China work together and strongly support solar growth, we believe we can reduce the cost of solar electricity to grid parity  where it is competitive with traditional energy sources - and create the blueprint for accelerated mass scale deployment of solar power worldwide to mitigate climate change, Ahearn said.
The Chinese delegations visit to First Solar is part of an itinerary that will take them to Washington, D.C. to meet with Congressional leaders and the Obama Administration on a variety of energy, trade and business initiatives.  Ahearn said he is encouraged that both China and the U.S. are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of promoting policies supportive of solar energy.
As a nation, we need strong policy support to create a vibrant solar industry and the green jobs that come with it, Ahearn said. Solar represents one of our best opportunities to help address global climate change and energy security, and we should ensure that it becomes a permanent, sustainable source of renewable electricity for the United States and the world.
First Solar recently announced agreements to build two large-scale solar power projects in Southern California. The installations, which will be among the largest of their kind, will have a generation capacity of 550 megawatts of photovoltaic electricity, enough to provide power to approximately 170,000 homes.
 
We are interested in teaming with progressive government and community leaders to help them achieve their goals for mass-scale deployment of affordable solar power. We believe in investing in the communities we serve and enabling them with advanced technology and global best practices, Ahearn said.

 ORDOS CITY GOVERNMENT
 
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
     
 
 
 
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) constitutes an agreement between Ordos City Government (Ordos) and First Solar, Inc. (First Solar, and collectively, the Participants).  The Participants have reached the following understandings:
 
 
 
The Chinese government has responded vigorously to the challenges of sustainable economic development, environmental protection and climate change.  As part of this response, China has expressed an intention to transition to a low carbon infrastructure and to further expand its use of renewable energy, including solar power.  China is interested in expanding its capabilities to produce affordable solar electricity with sustainable technologies and industrial processes.
 
Ordos is a prominent city within the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia and has demonstrated leadership in renewable energy and the development of a low carbon infrastructure.  Ordos is currently developing the Ordos New Energy Industry Demonstration Zone (the undertaker on the Chinese side) in Hangjin Banner, a planned 11,950 MW renewable energy park that could serve as a model for renewable power generation in China and throughout the world.  When completed, the Ordos New Energy Industry Demonstration Zone is expected to contain 6,950 MW of wind generation, 3,900 MW of photovoltaic power plants, 720 MW of concentrating solar power plants, 310 MW of biomass plants and 70 MW of hydro storage.  Ordos government intends to build a low carbon economy through the comprehensive development of diverse new energy resources and manufacturing, including the establishment of an advanced industrial base.
 
First Solar is a leading provider of solar (photovoltaic) modules and engineered solar power plants.  First Solar utilizes advanced technology that has enabled significant and continuing reductions in solar electricity costs.  In addition, First Solar operates a sustainable, closed loop product life cycle (including recycling products after use) that protects the environment, while also minimizing its carbon footprint and energy requirements.  First Solar is interested in serving and investing in markets such as China that are committed to making solar electricity part of their long term electricity infrastructures.
 
The Participants intend to cooperate as described in this MOU in order to advance their respective interests and to establish a long-term strategic partnership.
 
 
First Solar will, through an appropriate business model, develop and construct a 2,000 MW photovoltaic power plant (the Project) located within the Ordos New Energy Industry Demonstration Zone.  First Solar will supply the Project with low cost solar modules and provide additional engineering, procurement, training and other project support necessary to assure that the Project is successfully executed.  Ordos will arrange for suitable sites for the Project within the Ordos New Energy Industry Demonstration Zone.  Ordos will also provide adequate policy support to enable the financial feasibility of the Project and to generate opportunities to localize the solar value chain as described below.
 
The Project will be built in multiple phases over the period 2009 to 2019.  Phase 1 will be a 30 MW demonstration project that will begin construction by June 1, 2010 and be completed as soon thereafter as practicable.  Phases 2, 3 and 4 will be 100 MW, 870 MW and 1000 MW.  Each Phase will start construction following the completion of the previous Phase.  The Participants will agree on an annual installation schedule that allows Phases 2 and 3 to be completed by December 31, 2014 and Phase 4 to be completed by December 31, 2019. The Project will operate under a feed-in-tariff that is adequate to support the financial feasibility of the Project.
 
First Solar intends to actively participate in the development of the photovoltaic industry in China.  First Solar intends to facilitate expansion of the supply chains in China for thin film photovoltaic module production and for the recycling of photovoltaic modules after use. During the implementation of the Phases covered by the time period from 2009 through 2014, First Solar intends to actively review the possibility of module and supplier manufacturing sites in Ordos, and other considerations required to support a First Solar investment.  First Solar will also pursue additional multi-year opportunities for the sale of modules in China in preparation for a factory investment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This MOU sets forth the agreement in principle among the Participants concerning the Project and potential investment, but does not purport to include all the essential terms of the Project or potential investment, and, in any event, it is not intended to be and is not a legally binding agreement on the part of the parties hereto.  A legally binding obligation, if any, shall only arise upon the execution of the definitive agreements for the Project and potential investment.

TEMPE, Arizona, Sept. 8, 2009  First Solar today announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Chinese government to build a 2 gigawatt solar power plant in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, China.
Pursuant to the MOU, signed in the presence of Chairman Wu Bangguo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, the solar project in Ordos will be built over a multi-year period.  Phase 1 will be a 30 megawatt demonstration project that will begin construction by June 1, 2010 and be completed as soon thereafter as practicable.  Phases 2, 3 and 4 will be 100 megawatts, 870 megawatts, and 1,000 megawatts.  Phases 2 and 3 will be completed in 2014 and Phase 4 will be completed by 2019.
This major commitment to solar power is a direct result of the progressive energy policies being adopted in China to create a sustainable, long-term market for solar and a low carbon future for China, First Solar CEO Mike Ahearn said at the signing ceremony.  Were proud to be announcing this precedent-setting project today.  It represents an encouraging step forward toward the mass-scale deployment of solar power worldwide to help mitigate climate change concerns.
The project will operate under a feed-in-tariff which will guarantee the pricing of electricity produced by the power plant over a long-term period.
The Chinese feed-in tariff will be critical to this project, Ahearn said. This type of forward-looking government policy is necessary to create a strong solar market and facilitate the construction of a project of this size, which in turn continues to drive the cost of solar electricity closer to grid parity  where it is competitive with traditional energy sources.
The MOU contemplates that during the implementation of the initial phases of the project First Solar will actively review the possibility of module and supplier manufacturing sites in Ordos, and other considerations required to support a First Solar investment. First Solar also intends to facilitate expansion of the supply chains in China for thin film photovoltaic module production and for the recycling of photovoltaic modules after use.
 We are very pleased to be partnering with one of the solar industrys global technology leaders in a project of such significance to Ordoss low carbon future, said Cao Zhichen, vice mayor of Ordos Municipal Government.  Discussions with First Solar about building a factory in China demonstrate to investors in China that they can confidently invest in the most advanced technologies available.
The MOU sets forth the agreement in principle of the parties concerning the project and related activities.  Final agreement between the parties is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements among the parties.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          On September 4, 2009, First Solar, Inc., (the "Company") entered into a $300,000,000 revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of September 4, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), among the Company, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH (the "Subsidiary Borrower"), the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), Bank of America and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as Documentation Agents, and Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as Syndication Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Credit Agreement provides the Company, the Subsidiary Borrower (and other subsidiaries of the Company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement) with a senior secured three-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000, a portion of which is available for letters of credit and swingline loans. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. References to the Company below include the Subsidiary Borrower and any additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement, where the context so requires. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility up to $400,000,000. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements as described below.
          Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the rate (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurocurrency deposits for a period of one month appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page plus 1.0% or (b) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the rate (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurocurrency deposits for a period of one, two, three or six months or, subject to availability to the Lenders, nine or twelve months, as selected by the Company appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page. Until financial statements are delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the closing date of the Credit Facility, the interest rate with respect to the revolving loans is a percentage per annum equal to (1) the base rate plus 1.75% for base rate loans or (2) the eurocurrency rate plus 2.75% for eurocurrency rate loans. After such date, applicable margins with respect to the revolving loans will be adjusted based on (i) the Company's consolidated leverage ratio from time to time and, (ii) at any time that the revolving loans shall have a certain debt rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, changes in such debt rating.
          In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the Lenders in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments thereunder. Until financial statements are delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the closing date of the Credit Facility, the commitment fee rate is 0.375% per annum. After such date, the commitment fee will be adjusted based on (i) the Company's consolidated leverage ratio from time to time and, (ii) at any time that the revolving loans shall have a certain debt rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, changes in such debt rating. The Company will also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee in an amount agreed by the Company and such issuing lender, in addition to customary letter of credit fees.
          The Company may designate additional borrowing subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement subject to providing notice and certain documentation to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent's consultation with all the Lenders that such designation does not cause any economic, legal or

If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, ABR Loans or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro plus the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans, on demand, from the applicable Borrower.
          (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the applicable Borrower hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro, at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short term funds in Euro. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the applicable Borrower.
pro
rata
          (f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.15(e) or 3.4(a), unless subject to a good faith dispute, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
           2.16 . (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
Requirements of Law
          (i) shall subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any (or any increase in any) Other Connection Taxes with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by
 
it, except any such Taxes imposed on or measured by its net income or profits (however denominated) or franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income or profits taxes;
          (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or
          (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of clause (i), any Loan, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the applicable Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, promptly following its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
          (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
          (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
           2.17 . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes unless such withholding is required by any Requirement of Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it (or in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, by such Lender for the account of any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners) is so required to deduct and
Taxes
 
withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent (or such Lender, if applicable) may so deduct and withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required withholdings or deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender, any Issuing Lender or its beneficial owner, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholdings or deductions been made.
          (b) Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender (or its beneficial owner) or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) Within 10 days after demand therefor, each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (or any Loan Party) for the full amount of any Taxes (or in the case of a Loan Party, any Excluded Taxes) attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party (provided that, with respect to the Administrative Agent, only to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and together with reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or the Loan Parties, as applicable, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (f) Each Fee Receiver hereby represents that it is a Permitted Fee Receiver and agrees to update Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or its successor form) or applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or its successor form) upon any change in such Person's circumstances or if such form expires or becomes inaccurate or obsolete, and to promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if such Person becomes legally ineligible to provide such form.
          (g) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding Tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related Participation shall have
 
been purchased), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law (if any) as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, in the case of any withholding Tax other than the U.S. federal withholding Tax, the completion, execution and submission of such forms shall not be required if (1) in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender and (2) in the case of German withholding Tax, such forms are not substantially similar to forms prescribed by applicable law as of the date hereof for exemption from or reduction of German withholding Tax. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related Participation shall have been purchased (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
          (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income Tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party,
          (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
          (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the Form of Exhibit H to the effect that (A) such Foreign Lender is not (1) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) the interest payment in question is not effectively connected with the United States trade or business conducted by such Lender (a "") and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN,
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
          (iv) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical participation), an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of each such beneficial owner, or
provided
          (v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
          (h) If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes with respect to such refund) of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to the receipt of such refund), that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will any Issuing Lender or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party the payment of which would place the Issuing Lender or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Lender or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
          (i) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
           2.18 . Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans, or a conversion of Eurocurrency Loans into Eurocurrency Loans with a different Interest Period, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurocurrency market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Company by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Indemnity

           2.19 . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.16 or 2.17(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such
Change of Lending Office
 
Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; , that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and , , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a). Each Lender may at any time and for any period, by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, designate another lending office (including an Affiliate of a Lender) for any Loans so long as such designation would not give rise to any additional obligation on the part of any Borrower under Section 2.16 or 2.17(a).

           2.20 . The Company shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (b) is a Defaulting Lender, or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, with a replacement financial institution; that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.19 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) each applicable Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.18 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to an Assignment and Acceptance and shall not be required to execute an Assignment and Acceptance), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
Replacement of Lenders
provided
           2.21 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
          (a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.6;
          (b) the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder, provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, and any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of any affected Lender or all affected Lenders or such Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender that is an affected Lender or such Lender;
          (c) if any Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
          (i) all or any part of such Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but
 
only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Extensions of Credit does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time; and
          (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the Swingline Loans and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Obligations are outstanding, unless the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Lender, as applicable, have agreed on an alternate arrangement;
          (iii) if the applicable Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 2.21(c), such Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations during the period of such collateralization;
          (iv) if the Revolving Percentages of the L/C Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be correspondingly adjusted for the benefit of such non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Percentages; or
          (v) if any Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Lender until such Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is cash collateralized and/or reallocated;
          (d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lenders shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein);
          (e) if no Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations then exist, or all the obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of the outstanding Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations have been reallocated, cash collateralized or prepaid as contemplated in paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) of this Section 2.21, the Company shall have the right, notwithstanding Section 2.15, to terminate the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender only upon not less than three Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent and payment in full on the date of such termination to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Defaulting Lender, of the principal and accrued interest and fees then owing to such Defaulting Lender, with the Company remaining liable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.18 if such payment is made in respect of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto; and
 
          (f) any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder on account of any fees shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lender hereunder, (iii) third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by an Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any existing or future participating interest in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit, (iv) fourth, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (v) fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any Loans under this Agreement, and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
          In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Revolving Percentages of the non-Defaulting Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage.
           2.22 The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary that is (i) a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) a Manufacturing Subsidiary, as a Borrowing Subsidiary upon ten Business Days notice, or shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (such notice to include the name, primary business address and tax identification number of such proposed Borrowing Subsidiary). Upon proper notice and receipt by the Administrative Agent of such documents and legal opinions as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and subject to the Administrative Agent's determining in consultation with all the Lenders that designating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary would not cause any Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. A Restricted Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder at such time the Company gives at least ten Business Days prior notice (or, shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of its intention of terminating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that any such termination shall not be effective and such Restricted Subsidiary shall remain a Borrowing Subsidiary until such time as Loans to such Borrowing Subsidiary and accrued interest thereon and all other amounts then due from such Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full. In this connection, if outstanding Letters of Credit have been issued for the account of a Borrowing Subsidiary but all its Loans and accrued interest thereon have been paid in full, the Company shall be permitted to reallocate such Letters of Credit to another Borrower for the purpose of terminating such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that such reallocation would not cause the applicable Issuing Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and such reallocation is documented in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender.

L/C Commitment
 
issue letters of credit ("") for the account of the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; that no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars or Euro, as the case may be, and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, that any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods of up to one year (but in no event shall any such renewal extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).

           3.2 . Each Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request.

In addition, such Borrower shall pay to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee in an amount agreed by the
Fees and Other Charges
 
Company and such Issuing Lender on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.
          (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, each Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower.
           3.4 .

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against such Issuing Lender, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the applicable Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to such Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date (i) in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars, at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Loans and (ii) in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in Euro, at a rate determined by such Issuing Lender to represent the cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro (which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans). A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

     6.1 .
Certain Matters Relating to Intercompany Receivables
     (a) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect such Grantor's Intercompany Receivables and the Administrative Agent may curtail or terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. If required by the Administrative Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of Intercompany Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be forthwith (and, in any event, within two Business Days) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form received, duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders only as provided in Section 6.5, and (ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor.
     (b) At any time after a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the Administrative Agent's request, each Grantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent all original and other documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions which gave rise to the Intercompany Receivables, including, without limitation, all original orders, invoices and shipping receipts.
     6.2 . (a) The Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default communicate with obligors under the Intercompany Receivables to verify with them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Intercompany Receivables.
Grantors Remain Liable
     (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Intercompany Receivables that the Intercompany Receivables have been assigned to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Administrative Agent.
     (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Intercompany Receivables to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation or liability under any Intercompany Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating thereto, nor
 
14
shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Intercompany Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.
     6.3 . (a) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to Section 6.3(b), each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash and non-cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Stock and all payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate or other organizational rights with respect to the Pledged Securities; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other organizational right exercised or other action taken which, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, would impair the Collateral or which would be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
Pledged Securities
     (b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds paid in respect of the Pledged Securities and make application thereof to the applicable Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine, and (ii) any or all of the Pledged Securities shall be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (x) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such Pledged Securities at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (y) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Pledged Securities as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Pledged Securities upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or other organizational structure of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Pledged Securities, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Pledged Securities with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it, but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.
     (c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Pledged Securities by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (x) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the Pledged Securities directly to the Administrative Agent.
     6.4 . At such intervals as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Administrative Agent, or, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative Agent's election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of Proceeds constituting Collateral, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, and any proceeds of the guarantees set forth in Section 2, in payment of the Obligations in the following order:
Application of Proceeds
 
15
     , to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents;
First
     , to the Administrative Agent, for application by it towards payment of amounts then due and owing and remaining unpaid in respect of the Obligations, among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of the Obligations then due and owing and remaining unpaid to the Secured Parties;
Second
pro
rata
     , to the Administrative Agent, for application by it towards prepayment of the Obligations, among the Secured Parties according to the amounts of the Obligations then held by the Secured Parties; and
Third
pro
rata
     , any balance remaining after the Obligations shall have been paid in full, no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding and the Revolving Commitments shall have terminated shall be paid over to the applicable Grantor or Guarantor.
Fourth
     6.5 . If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.5, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.
Code and Other Remedies
 
16
     6.6 . (a) If the Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 6.5, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act or any other similar foreign laws, the relevant Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act or any other similar foreign laws, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act or any other similar foreign laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any and all jurisdictions (including foreign jurisdictions) which the Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
Registration Rights
     (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, foreign laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws or foreign laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.
     (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 6.6 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.6 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 6.6 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.
     6.7 . Each Grantor hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, all Indebtedness owing by it to any Subsidiary of the Company shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of such Grantor's Obligations.
Subordination
     6.8 . Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and
Deficiency
 
17
disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.
     7.1 . (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without assent by such Grantor (but with notice to such Grantor, to the extent reasonably practicable, provided that failure to give such notice shall not render any actions taken by the Administrative Agent ineffective), to do any or all of the following (provided that the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing):
Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc
     (i) in the name of a Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Intercompany Receivable or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Intercompany Receivable or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;
     (ii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof;
     (iii) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 6.5 or 6.6, any indorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and
     (iv) (1) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative Agent shall direct; (2) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (3) sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with the Intercompany Receivables; (4) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; and (7) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent's option and such Grantor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' security
 
18
interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.
     (b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.
     (c) The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on any category of past due ABR Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Administrative Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent on demand.
     (d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released.
     7.2 . The Administrative Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Administrative Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Duty of Administrative Agent
     7.3 . Pursuant to any applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Each Grantor hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Administrative Agent of any financing statement with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof.
Execution of Financing Statements
     7.4 . Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.
Authority of Administrative Agent
 
19
     8.1 . None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.
Amendments in Writing
     8.2 . All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1.
Notices
     8.3 . Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

Ahearn, First Solars current Chief Executive Officer.  As previously announced, Mr. Ahearn will continue to serve in the full-time position of executive chairman.
Mr. Gillette, age 48, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Honeywell Aerospace since January 2005.  Honeywell Aerospace, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, is Honeywell International's largest business group with current sales of more than $12 billion annually. In this role, Mr. Gillette led Honeywell Aerospace's three main businessesAir Transport & Regional, Business & General Aviation, and Defense & Spacewith more than 40,000 associates at nearly 100 worldwide manufacturing and service sites.  Prior to this assignment, Mr. Gillette had served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Honeywell Transportation Systems since July 2001. Mr. Gillette holds a bachelor's of science degree in Finance from Indiana University.
On September 9, 2009, First Solar entered into an employment agreement and a change in control severance agreement with Mr. Gillette (the Employment Agreement and the Change in Control Severance Agreement, respectively), which are included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K. Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Gillette is entitled to an annual base salary of $850,000 (subject to annual increases at First Solars discretion).  Mr. Gillettes annual bonus will be determined each year by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, taking into account individual performance and the performance of First Solar; provided that (i) Mr. Gillettes target bonus opportunity for each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010 will be 100% of his annual salary and (ii) Mr. Gillettes annual bonus for fiscal year 2009 will be at least $850,000 (without proration) and subject to upward adjustment based on performance.  With respect to fiscal years 2009 and 2010, Mr. Gillette will be provided with annual restricted stock unit awards under First Solars Amended and Restated 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan or the successor to such plan with an annual grant date value of $5,000,000 (valuing such awards consistently with First Solars practices for other senior executives).  Mr. Gillette will not receive any compensation in connection with his service as a member of First Solars Board of Directors.
First Solar will compensate Mr. Gillette for amounts forfeited with his current employer with the following initial equity grants and cash payments.  Mr. Gillette will be granted (i) fully vested First Solar shares having an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $3,250,000; (ii) fully vested First Solar stock options having an aggregate Black-Scholes value on the date of grant equal to $3,250,000; and (iii) restricted stock units having an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $6,500,000 and subject to cliff-vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant (initial RSUs), with no early acceleration triggers other than change in control.  The foregoing awards will be granted as soon as practicable following Mr. Gillettes first day of employment with First Solar but no later than 15 days thereafter.  Mr. Gillette will also be paid a sign-on bonus of $5,000,000 in cash, 50% to be paid as soon as practicable following Mr. Gillettes first day of employment with First Solar, but no later than 15 days thereafter, and the other 50% to be paid on the first anniversary of Mr. Gillettes first day of employment with First Solar, regardless of whether Mr. Gillette remains employed with First Solar through the applicable payment date.
Mr. Gillette will also be eligible to participate in First Solars standard employee benefit programs and will be entitled to benefits and perquisites consistent with those provided to other senior executives of First Solar.
In the event of a termination of employment by First Solar without cause outside the change in control protection period (as described below), Mr. Gillette will receive cash severance equal to two times his annual salary, subject to delivery of a release of claims, as well as medical coverage for 24 months or until such time as Mr. Gillette obtains coverage under any other medical benefits plan.  In addition, in the event Mr. Gillettes employment is terminated without cause or due to his death or disability outside the change in control protection period, then other than with respect to the initial RSUs which do not provide for accelerated vesting, any equity award (or portion thereof) that would have vested or become exercisable by its terms within 12 months following the date of Mr. Gillettes termination of employment (assuming he continued to perform services for such 12-month period) will become vested or exercisable as of the date of his termination of employment.
As set forth in the Change in Control Severance Agreement, in the event of a termination of Mr. Gillettes employment by First Solar without cause or by Mr. Gillette for good reason within the two years following a change in control (or prior to a change in control at the request of the third party effecting the change in control), such period the change in control protection period, Mr. Gillette will receive (i) a prorated target bonus (or if higher a prorated bonus based on the average bonuses paid to Mr. Gillette over the 3 years preceding the change in control), (ii) cash severance equal to two times the sum of his annual salary and bonus, (iii) continued health and welfare benefits for 18 months, (iv) up to $20,000 in expenses for outplacement services, subject to delivery of a release of claims, and (v) full vesting of all of his equity awards.  In addition, the Company will provide a tax gross up for parachute excise taxes unless it is determined that payments to Mr. Gillette do not exceed 110% of the amount that could be paid to him without incurring such excise taxes (a safe harbor amount), in which case payments shall be reduced to the safe harbor amount.
Mr. Gillette has also entered into a separate confidentiality and intellectual property agreement and a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement, the terms of which agreements are consistent in all material respects to the forms of these agreements that First Solar has previously entered into with its executive officers.  Pursuant to the non-competition and non-solicitation agreement, Mr. Gillette is subject to certain restrictions on competition and solicitation during his employment with First Solar and for two years thereafter.  The forms of these agreements and First Solars Amended and Restated 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan are described in First Solars Proxy Statement for its 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which First Solar filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The foregoing description of the Employment Agreement and the Change in Control Severance Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

SECTION 5.  
Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
 
(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment that is paid or payable during the term of this Agreement would be subject to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a ) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes imposed upon the 280G Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the 280G Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon such Payments.  The Companys obligation to make 280G Gross-Up Payments under this Section 5 shall not be conditioned upon the Executives termination of employment and shall survive and apply after the Executives termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a 280G Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount that could be paid to the Executive without giving rise to any Excise Tax (the ), then no 280G Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Payments, in the aggregate, are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount.  If such a reduction is necessary, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order:  (i) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(i) (severance), (ii) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(ii) (prorated annual bonus), (iii) any other cash Payments, (iv) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(iii) (welfare benefit continuation) and (v) the accelerated vesting under Section 3.
280G Gross-Up Payment
Safe Harbor Amount
 
(b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 5(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when a 280G Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such 280G Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Section 5 by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that shall be designated by the Executive (the ).  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  For purposes of determining the amount of any 280G Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay Federal income tax at the highest marginal rate applicable to individuals in the calendar year in which any such 280G Gross-Up Payment is to be made and deemed to pay state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates applicable to individuals in the state or locality of the Executives residence or place of employment in the calendar year in which any such 280G Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of state and local taxes, taking into account limitations applicable to individuals subject to Federal income tax at the highest marginal rate.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any 280G Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 5, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall so indicate to the Executive in writing.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that 280G Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an ), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 5(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.

Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than tenbusiness days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim.  Failure to give timely notice shall not prejudice the Executives right to 280G Gross-Up Payments and rights of indemnity under this Section 5.  The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).

Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claim on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in oneor more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that (A) if the Company pays the tax claim on behalf of the Executive and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment and (B) if such contest results in any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due, such extension must be limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Companys control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the 280G Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

If, after the payment by the Company of any tax claim pursuant to Section 5(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of the 30day period after such determination, then the amount the Company paid in respect of such claim shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of 280G Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

Exhibit 99.1
 
First Solar Announces 2010 Guidance and Capacity Expansion Plans
 
Net Sales of $2.7 to $2.9 billion
Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $6.05 to $6.85
Free cash flow between $180 and $290 million (operating cash flow of $730 to $790 million)
Eight production lines to be added, bringing annual or announced production capacity to 1.8GW
 First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR), today announced 2010 financial guidance and plans for the addition of eight production lines at its manufacturing center in Kulim, Malaysia, starting production in the first half of 2011.
TEMPE, Ariz., Dec. 16, 2009
 
Fiscal year 2010 net sales are projected to be $2.7 to $2.9 billion, with EPS of $6.05 to $6.85.  The Company plans to invest $365 million of capital to add two production plants, consisting of four manufacturing lines each.  This expansion is expected to increase First Solars annual capacity by 424 megawatts (MW), assuming the third quarter 2009 reported annual line run rate of 53 MW.
 
First Solar is expanding capacity to satisfy a global contracted and advanced pipeline of over six gigawatts (GW) from 2010-2012, said Rob Gillette, First Solar chief executive officer.  In 2009 we increased our contracted North American pipeline by approximately 1.5GW, expanding our penetration in  transition markets.  This drives further capacity needs around a demand pool that is less volatile and more predictable than the traditional feed in tariff-based markets.  
 
With the announced expansion in Malaysia and the previously announced two-line factory in France, First Solar expects to add ten production lines during 2010 and 2011, increasing capacity by over 48% from current levels, bringing  First Solars  annual or announced production capacity to approximately 1.8GW (based on current production levels).
 
In 2010, First Solar forecasts net sales of $2.7 to $2.9 billion.  Consolidated gross margins are expected to be 38% with operating margins at 23-24%, influenced by a mix shift to the systems business, which includes $0.6 to $0.8 billion of EPC/project development.  Start-up expenses associated with the Malaysian expansion are projected to be approximately $25 million, and stock-based compensation is projected to be $95 to $105 million.  Other assumptions include a tax rate of 15%, annual blended euro exchange rate of $1.38 (based on a 2010 spot rate of $1.40/Euro), and diluted shares outstanding of 86 to 87 million.  EPS is projected in the range of $6.05 to $6.85.  Total capital spending is projected to range from $500 to $550 million, including the Malaysian expansion.  As a result, the Company expects to generate $730 to $790 million of operating cash flow and $180 to $290 million of free cash flow.
 
The Company has posted a presentation describing this guidance, including additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, on the Investor section of its website at
www.firstsolar.com
.  The guidance will also be discussed in a live audio webcast beginning today at 4:15 p.m. ET.  Please visit
www.firstsolar.com
to access the webcast.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
This press release includes a presentation of Free Cash Flow, which is a financial measure not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 
Free Cash Flow is Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities minus capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment).  The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its businesses, and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Companys liquidity and ability to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including its ability to reduce debt and make strategic investments.  A general limitation of a Free Cash Flow measure is that it is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and thus may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and excluded items. 
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements are based on managements current expectations or beliefs, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.  The forward-looking statements in this release do not constitute guarantees of future performance.  These statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, including risks associated with the Company's business involving the Company's products, their development and distribution, economic and competitive factors and the Company's key strategic relationships and other risks detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. First Solar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information contained in this press release or with respect to the announcements described herein.

Exhibit 99.1
TEMPE, Ariz., Apr 28, 2010  First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq:FSLR) and NextLight Renewable Power, LLC today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for First Solar to acquire NextLight, a leading developer of utility-scale solar projects in the southwestern United States. The acquisition includes a 1,100 megawatt (MW) solar project pipeline, further solidifying First Solar's position as a leader in the U.S. utility renewable power market.
The acquisition of NextLight includes:
NextLight's projects, ranging in size from 30MW to 290MW, expand the scope and diversity of First Solar's pipeline. The projects are largely located on private land.
"NextLight has assembled a project pipeline that very much complements First Solar's project portfolio. We are looking forward to having the highly experienced NextLight team join First Solar," said Rob Gillette, First Solar chief executive officer.
"The combination of NextLight and First Solar brings best-in-class power development experience and discipline to the emerging utility-scale solar industry. We look forward to joining the First Solar organization and leveraging their expertise to deliver high-quality solar generation to our customers," said Frank De Rosa, NextLight chief executive officer.
The transaction represents another strategic step in First Solar's expansion in the U.S. utility-scale power market, which began in 2007 with the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy and continued with the acquisitions of solar project pipelines from OptiSolar in 2009 and Edison Mission Group in 2010.
"Success in today's competitive solar market requires a complete solution for our customers' renewable energy needs," said Gillette. "First Solar is uniquely positioned to deliver utility scale solar power plants including project development, module manufacturing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), project finance expertise and operations and maintenance."
 
First Solar will acquire NextLight in an all-cash transaction that is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2010, pending the satisfaction of certain closing conditions specified in the merger agreement. Total consideration for the transaction is approximately $285 million, subject to certain closing adjustments as provided in the merger agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 27, 2010. Quarterly net sales were $568.0 million, up 36% from $418.2 million in the first quarter of 2009, mainly due to strong PV module demand and increased production, partially offset by a decline in pricing.  First quarter 2010 net sales declined $73.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to a shift from turnkey system sales to module sales.
Tempe, Ariz.   April 28, 2010
The first quarter 2010 net income was $172.3 million or $2.00 per fully diluted share, up from the prior year of $164.6 million or $1.99 per fully diluted share, which included a $0.14 per share one-time tax benefit related to our Malaysian tax holiday. Net income for the first quarter was up from $141.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter 2009 because of higher volumes, increased module prices and the absence of certain non-recurring expenses.
The First Solar Board of Directors has approved an additional four line manufacturing plant with an annual capacity of over 220 MW at the first quarter 2010 line run-rate. The plant is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2011.
For 2010, First Solar forecasts net sales of $2.6 to $2.7 billion, reflecting reallocation of module capacity from our systems business to meet stronger module demand by our European customers. Earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $6.80 to $7.30, and include $0.09-0.10 per share dilution for the pending acquisition of NextLight Renewable Power, LLC. Total capital spending is projected to be $625 to $650 million.  The company expects to generate $725 to $775 million of operating cash flow. First Solar has posted its First Quarter Earnings Call Presentation, which includes guidance for fiscal 2010 and additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, in the Investor section of its websi te at www.firstsolar.com.
 
First Solar will discuss these results and outlook for fiscal 2010 in a conference call scheduled for today at 1:30 p.m. MST (4:30 p.m. EDT). Investors may access a live audio webcast of this conference call and the earnings call presentation in the investors section of the Companys web site at www.firstsolar.com.

The Company is required to prepay loans or cash collateralize letters of credit upon notice from the Administrative Agent that, as of any date of calculation by the Administrative Agent, the aggregate amount of revolving extensions of credit exceeds 105% of the total revolving commitments of the Lenders, in such amounts such that, after giving effect to such mandatory prepayment, such excess shall be eliminated.

(c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by a Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., Local Time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the relevant Funding Office, in Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in Dollars), Canadian Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in Canadian Dollars), British Pound Sterling (with respect to Obligations denominated in British Pound Sterling) and Euro (with respect to Obligations denominated in Euro), and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 9.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, ABR Loans or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro plus the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans, on demand, from the applicable Borrower.
 
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the applicable Borrower hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro, at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short term funds in Euro. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the applicable Borrower.

(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.15(e) or 3.4(a), unless subject to a good faith dispute, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
2.16 . (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
Requirements of Law
(i) shall subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any (or any increase in any) Other Connection Taxes with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it, except any such Taxes imposed on or measured by its net income or profits (however denominated) or franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income or profits taxes;
(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or
(iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition (other than with respect to Taxes);
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of clause (i), any Loan, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the applicable Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, promptly following its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith shall be deemed to be a change in a Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
provided
(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
(c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
2.17 . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes unless such withholding is required by any Requirement of Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it (or in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, by such Lender for the account of any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners) is so required to deduct and withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent (or such Lender, if applicable) may so deduct and withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required withholdings or deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender, any Issuing Lender or its beneficial owner, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholdings or deductions been made.
Taxes
(b) Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender (or its beneficial owner) or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Within 10 days after demand therefor, each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (or any Loan Party) for the full amount of any Taxes (or in the case of a Loan Party, any Excluded Taxes) attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party (provided that, with respect to the Administrative Agent, only to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and together with reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or the Loan Parties, as applicable, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding Tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related Participation shall have been purchased), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law (if any) as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, in the case of any withholding Tax other than the U.S. federal withholding Tax,the completion, execution and submission of such forms shall not be required if (1) in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender and (2) in the case of German withholding Tax, such forms are not substantially similar to forms prescribed by applicable law as of the date hereof for exemption from or reduction of German withholding Tax.
 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, each Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(iii) In addition to the foregoing, if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, FATCA shall include any amendments thereto and any regulations or official interpretations thereof.
(iv) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h) If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes with respect to such refund) of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to the receipt of such refund), that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will any Issuing Lender or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party the payment of which would place the Issuing Lender or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Lender or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
(i) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
2.18 . Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans, or a conversion of Eurocurrency Loans into Eurocurrency Loans with a different Interest Period, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurocurrency market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Company by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Indemnity

2.19 . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.16 or 2.17(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; , that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and , , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a). Each Lender may at any time and for any period, by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, designate another lending office (including an Affiliate of a Lender) for any Loans so long as such designation would not give rise to any additional obligation on the part of any Borrower under Section 2.16 or 2.17(a).

2.20 . The Company shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (b) is a Defaulting Lender, or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, with a replacement financial institution; that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.19 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) each applicable Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.18 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to an Assignment and Acceptance and shall not be required to execute an Assignment and Acceptance), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
Replacement of Lenders
provided
 
2.21 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders.
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.6;
(b) the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder, provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, and any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of any affected Lender or all affected Lenders or such Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender that is an affected Lender or such Lender;
(c) if any Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of such Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Extensions of Credit does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time; and
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the Swingline Loans and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Obligations are outstanding, unless the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Lender, as applicable, have agreed on an alternate arrangement;
(iii) if the applicable Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 2.21(c), such Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations during the period of such collateralization;
(iv) if the Revolving Percentages of the L/C Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be correspondingly adjusted for the benefit of such non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Percentages; or
(v) if any Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Lender until such Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is cash collateralized and/or reallocated;
 
(d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lenders shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein);
(e) if no Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations then exist, or all the obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of the outstanding Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations have been reallocated, cash collateralized or prepaid as contemplated in paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) of this Section 2.21, the Company shall have the right, notwithstanding Section 2.15, to terminate the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender only upon not less than three Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent and payment in full on the date of such termination to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Defaulting Lender, of the principal and accrued interest and fees then owing to such Defaulting Lender, with the Company remaining liable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.18 if such payment is made in respect of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto; and
(f) any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder on account of any fees shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lender hereunder, (iii) third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by an Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any existing or future participating interest in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit, (iv) fourth, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (v) fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any Loans under this Agreement, and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Revolving Percentages of the non-Defaulting Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage.
 
2.22 The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary that is (i) a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) a Manufacturing Subsidiary, as a Borrowing Subsidiary upon ten Business Days notice, or shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (such notice to include the name, primary business address and tax identification number of such proposed Borrowing Subsidiary). Upon proper notice and receipt by the Administrative Agent of such documents and legal opinions as the Administrative Agent in consultation with all the Lenders may reasonably request (including a legal opinion that no withholding Tax is applicable with respect to any payment made by such Restricted Subsidiary and, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Foreign Subsidiary, any documents contemplated to be delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary (and its Restricted Subsidiaries and parent entities) pursuant to 6.9(c) were such Restricted Subsidiary a new Foreign Subsidiary acquired on the date of designation of such new Borrowing Subsidiary) and subject to the Administrative Agent's determining in consultation with all the Lenders that designating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary would not cause any Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage (it being understood and agreed that no Lender shall be deemed to suffer any such disadvantage on account of any withholding Tax being applicable to any payment made by such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the applicable Loan Parties agree to treat any such withholding Tax as an Indemnified Tax, in which case no legal opinion that no withholding Tax is applicable shall be required), such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. A Restricted Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder at such time the Company gives at least ten Business Days prior notice (or, shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of its intention of terminating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that any such termination shall not be effective and such Restricted Subsidiary shall remain a Borrowing Subsidiary until such time as Loans to such Borrowing Subsidiary and accrued interest thereon and all other amounts then due from such Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full. In this connection, if outstanding Letters of Credit have been issued for the account of a Borrowing Subsidiary but all its Loans and accrued interest thereon have been paid in full, the Company shall be permitted to reallocate such Letters of Credit to another Borrower for the purpose of terminating such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that such reallocation would not cause the applicable Issuing Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and such reallocation is documented in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender.

Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euro or British Pound Sterling, as the case may be, and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, that any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods of up to one year (but in no event shall any such renewal extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).

3.2 . Each Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, such Issuing Lender will verify with the Administrative Agent whether the requested Letter of Credit is permitted under Section 3.1 and following the receipt of such verification, such Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall such Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the applicable Borrower. Following receipt of such notice and prior to the issuance of a requested Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall calculate the Dollar Equivalent of such Letter of Credit if it is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars and shall notify the Company and such Issuing Lender of the amount of the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit after giving effect to (i) the issuance of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the issuance or expiration of any other Letter of Credit that is to be issued or will expire prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and (iii) the borrowing or repayment of any Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans that (based upon notices delivered to the Administrative Agent by the Company) are to be borrowed or repaid prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued only if (and upon issuance of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the L/C Commitment and (ii) the amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit shall not exceed the Total Revolving Commitments. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against such Issuing Lender, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the applicable Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

First Solar, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results
 
Tempe, Arizona - October 28, 2010
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 25, 2010. Third quarter 2010 net sales were $797.9 million, an increase of $210.0 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased system sales (driven principally by the sale of the 60 megawatt (AC) Sarnia Phase 2 project in Canada), partially offset by a decline in our module average selling prices and lower blended euro exchange rates. Quarterly net sales grew 66% from $480.9 million in the third quarter of 2009, due to increased systems revenue and module production volumes, partially offset by a decline in our module average selling prices and lower blended euro exchange rates.
 
Third quarter net income per fully diluted share was $2.04, up from $1.84 in the second quarter of 2010 and up from $1.79 in the third quarter of 2009. The third quarter net income includes a one-time tax expense of $14.7 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share, relating to the Company's decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries. Quarter over quarter, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher net sales partially offset by the one-time tax expense. Year over year, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher module production, lower module cost per wa tt and increased system sales, partially offset by reduced module average selling prices and the above one-time tax expense.
 
We continue to execute on our growth strategy and to develop sustainable markets for solar electricity, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. Our investment in research and development combined with plans to nearly double our manufacturing capacity will help us meet robust customer demand while continuing to drive down the cost of solar power.

TEMPE, Ariz. - Dec. 13, 2010 - First Solar, Inc.

First Solar, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2010 Financial Results
 
Tempe, Arizona - February 24, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 net sales were $610 million, a decrease of $188 million from the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to the timing of system sales and the December implementation of 2011 pricing, partially offset by an increase in volume. Quarterly net sales decreased slightly from $641 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to decreased systems revenue and reduced module prices, partially offset by higher volume. Net sales for the fiscal year 2010 were $2,564 million, up 24% from $2,066 million in fiscal year 2009.
 
Fourth quarter net income per fully diluted share was $1.80, down from $2.04 in the third quarter of 2010 and up from $1.65 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Quarter over quarter, the net income decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales and increased expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins. Year over year, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher module production and lower module cost per watt, partially offset by reduced module average selling prices and increased expenses. Fiscal 2010 net income per fully diluted share was $7.68, up from $7.53 in fiscal 2009.
 
First Solar achieved several milestones in 2010:
 
In the fourth quarter the operations team executed well, and we sold 400 MW of projects in North America, positioning us to achieve our 2011 growth goals, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. We have good demand visibility in 2011 and a broader geographic reach, which gives us confidence in our ability to sell the 2 GW that we plan to produce.
 
For 2011, First Solar is updating guidance as follows:
  
First Solar will discuss these results and the outlook for 2011 in a conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. EST. Investors may access a live audio webcast of this conference call and the earnings call presentation, which includes
 
 
guidance for fiscal 2011 and additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, in the Investors section of the Company's website at www.firstsolar.com.
 
An audio replay of the conference call will also be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call. The audio replay will remain available until Tuesday, March 1, 2011 at 7:30 p.m. EST and can be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112 if you are calling from within the United States or 719-457-0820 if you are calling from outside the United States and entering the replay pass code 8382775.

First Solar Announces First Quarter 2011 Financial Results
 
 
Tempe, Ariz. - May 3, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2011. Net sales were $567 million in the quarter, a decrease of $42.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2010, due to the allocation of modules to our systems projects in order to meet the project contractual delivery schedules, seven fewer production days, and a full quarter impact of the pricing change implemented in December of 2010. Quarterly net sales decreased slightly from $568 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower average selling prices.
 
First quarter net income per fully diluted share was $1.33, down from $1.80 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $2.00 in the first quarter of 2010. Quarter over quarter, the net income decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales and gross margin. Year over year, the net income decrease was primarily driven by reduced average selling prices and higher expenses, partially offset by increased module production and lower module cost per watt.
 
Despite European market uncertainties, First Solar has good visibility into our demand for 2011, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. We continue to execute our cost roadmaps, invest in new module capacity, build our project pipeline and develop promising new markets around the world.
 
First Solar's updated 2011 guidance is as follows:
  
First Solar will discuss these results and the outlook for 2011 in a conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Investors may access a live audio webcast of this conference call and the earnings call presentation, which includes guidance for 2011 and additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, in the Investors section of the Company's website at www.firstsolar.com.
 
An audio replay of the conference call will also be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call. The audio replay will remain available until Sunday, May 8, 2011 at 7:30 p.m. EDT and can be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112 if you are calling from within the United States or 719-457-0820 if you are calling from outside the United States and entering the replay pass code 3266707.

On May 18, 2011, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH (the "Borrower"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of First Solar, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a EUR 124,500,000 Credit Facility Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as arranger (the "Arranger"), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Luxembourg Branch, as facility agent (the "Facility Agent"), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Luxembourg Branch, as security agent (the "Security Agent"), and the additional finance parties party thereto. A copy of the Credit Agreement (translated into English from the German original) is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Concurrently with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement dated as of May 18, 2011 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), among the Company, the Borrower and the Security Agent. A copy of the Guarantee Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The proceeds of the Credit Agreement will be used by the Borrower to, among other things, finance and/or refinance the acquisition of certain land parcels located in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and the construction of a new facility for the production of thin-film solar modules (the "FFO2 Production Facility").
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.35% (the "Margin") plus mandatory costs plus a euribor rate determined by reference to the rate for the offering of deposits in euro appearing on the Reuters screen (EURIBOR01) for the interest period selected by the Borrower. During the period from the date of the Credit Agreement until the date 17 months thereafter, unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee equal to 35% of the Margin.
The Borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, subject to compensation for customary "break costs" and certain other requirements. The Borrower is required to prepay loans with certain asset sales and insurance proceeds and may be required by the lenders to prepay the loans upon the occurrence of a change of control.
The loans made to the Borrower are (i) secured by, among other things, a first-ranking abstract land charge over the parcels of land on which the FFO2 Production Facility will be constructed and a pledge of a debt service reserve account and (ii) guaranteed by the Company pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement and by the German Federal Government and the Federal State of Brandenburg.
The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Borrower to incur indebtedness, create liens, effect asset sales, make dividends, other distributions and share buybacks, engage in reorganizations, make acquisitions and create joint ventures and make loans. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes financial covenants relating to minimum liquidity, maximum permitted leverage ratio and minimum EBITDA. The Credit Agreement also contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.
The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement, the guarantee and security documents described herein, and the transactions contemplated thereby, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of each of the documents described herein.
The information included in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference to this Item 2.03.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

B. COSTS FOR ISSUING THE GUARANTIES
In exchange for issuing a guaranty, an application fee (I), an issuance fee (II) and a guaranty fee (III) will be charged to the applicant/borrower pursuant to the following terms and conditions:
I. Application fee
In cases involving the application for a federal loan guaranty in connection with a state guaranty from the German Federal States of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia or Berlin ("New Federal States") pursuant to these instructions, a one-time application fee in the amount of 0.5 per cent of the guaranty under application (but not more than EURO 25,000.00) will be due and payable at the time the application is filed.
When applying for the federal loan guaranty in connection with a parallel state guaranty from one of the German Federal States not mentioned above ("Old Federal States"), an application fee in the amount of 0.5 per cent of the guaranty under application (but not more than EURO 25,000.00) will be due and payable for the federal loan guaranty application. At the same time, another application fee will be due and payable in an amount to be determined by the respective Federal State.
II. Issuance fee
The Borrower must pay an issuance fee [] for the guaranties from the time that the Federal/State Guarantor Decision is handed down (commitment letter) until the time the guaranty instrument or deed [] is issued.
Aushndigungsentgelt
Brgschaftsurkunde
At the time that the Federal/State Guarantor Decision is handed down, an amount of 0.5% of the highest guaranty amount will be payable. On the immediately following 1 April and 1 October of each given year, 0.5% of the highest guaranty amount relating to the principal must be paid for each half-year period commencing on those dates.
III. Guaranty fee
The Borrower must pay a guaranty fee for the guaranties from the time that the guaranty instrument or deed is issued and for the period of the guaranty's term. For parallel state guaranties, the guaranty fee will generally be 0.5% of the guaranty amount that exists or that has been approved as of those dates and such fee will be due on or before 1 April and 1 October of each year (half-year fee period), unless European rules require the imposition of higher fees. In certain groups of cases (, companies facing difficulties), the guarantor reserves the right to stipulate higher fees.
inter alia
Different European rules could apply specifically with respect to guaranties that are granted on the basis of so-called "" (Guarantee scheme under Temporary Framework), "" (Federal Framework  limited amounts of comparable aid) as well as the "" (Framework of aid) as well as the General Block Exemption Regulation. The guaranty fees in those cases are based on the relevant EU Commission "safe-harbour premiums" that are stipulated in the relevant rules or frameworks or under the approved methods for calculating the value of aid in N 197/2007, N 541/2007 and N 762/2007. Regarding the documentation requirements, see Schedule V or the detailed information in the testing matrix [] (see p. 1).

From the date that the guaranty instrument or deed is issued and on the immediately following 1 April and 1 October of each given year, generally 0.5% (or one-half of the percentage fee applicable under the requirements of the government aid laws) of the guaranty sums that exist or have been approved as of those dates (highest liability amount for the principal as set forth in the guaranty instrument any repayments of principal made, any owed and unpaid interest; for usable revolving guaranties/partial guaranty amounts, any temporary loan repayments will not be deemed repayments of principal) for each half-year commencing on those dates; and any issuance fee that had been previously paid will be credited against the guaranty fee which may still be owed in the same half-year fee period.
less
plus
If, as part of the agreement, the guaranteed loan is divided and securitised into several tranches relating to different half-year fee periods, then upon a well-founded request, tranche-based fee arrangements may be established on a case-by-case basis. The Federal government and the relevant Federal State would thereupon reserve the right to charge a processing or administrative fee in accordance with the application fee rules, in the event that there are significant changes to a guaranty that had been previously approved but not yet securitized.
With respect to the guaranties issued by the Federal government and by the Federal States of North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony Anhalt and Thuringia, the application fee as well as the administrative or processing fee for significant changes to a guaranty, which had been previously approved but not yet securitized, and the ongoing fees must be paid by wire transfer to PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Dsseldorf, and specifically to its escrow account under the name "Federal Ministry of Finance", account number 3 015 112, which is held at WestLB AG, Dsseldorf (bank routing code 300 500 00) and the transfer order must include the guaranty number. For guaranties issued by other Federal States, for which PricewaterhouseCoopers AG does not act as mandatary, the fees owed must be remitted to the relevant mandatary or to the accounts designated by the Federal States. Under the parallel state guaranties, the foregoing rules regarding the ongoing fees will apply uniformly to the guaranties issued by the Federal government and to the state guarantees of all Federal States5.

No Financing Party will be required to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement. This applies irrespective of any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

Any settlement or discharge between the Guarantor and any Financing Party shall be conditional upon no Security or payment to such Financing Party by the Guarantor or any other entity on behalf of the Guarantor being avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar laws of general application and, if any such Security or payment is so avoided or reduced, each Financing Party shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of such Security or payment from the Guarantor subsequently as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.
Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantor hereby confirms that if the Borrower and any Financing Party enter into any agreement or other arrangement, including (without limitation) any amendment or supplement to or restatement of any Finance Documents, howsoever fundamental, then the Borrower's execution of any such agreement or other arrangement, whether or not expressly made or purportedly made on behalf of the Guarantor, shall bind the Guarantor and the guarantee contained in this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without the need to obtain any confirmation or acknowledgement from the Guarantor that its guarantee continues in full force and effect and applies to the Guarantor's liabilities under the Finance Documents as amended, supplemented or restated in accordance with the agreement of the Borrower.
 
The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Financing Parties, such representation and warranty being an independent guarantee () pursuant to sections 241 and 311 BGB, that it has full knowledge of the entire contents of the Facilities Agreements (including, without limitation, all exhibits and schedules thereto), all necessary corporate action has been taken to authorise the execution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder and the exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations hereunder will not violate any provision of any existing law or any indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor is a party or which is binding on the Guarantor or any of its assets and the choice of German law of this Agreement will be recognised and enforced in its jurisdiction of incorporation and any judgment obtained in relation to a Finance Document in Germany will be recognised and enforced in its jurisdiction of incorporation and this Agreement creates, subject to any reservations contained in any legal opinion delivered to any Finance Party in connection with the Facilities Agreement, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor which are enforceable in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation, moratorium or other laws affecting Financing Parties' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or law.

The Security Agent shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by the Guarantor save in respect of such loss or damage which is suffered as a result of the wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the Security Agent.
 
No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Financing Parties, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
Changes and amendments to and waivers of this Agreement including this Clause 18 shall be made in writing (and in notarial form if required by law) and in accordance with the terms of the Facilities Agreements.

Borrowings under the Facility Agreement bear interest at an expected rate per annum equal to a KLIBOR rate determined by reference to the rate for the offering of deposits in Ringgit Malaysia appearing on the "KLIBOR" page of the Reuters screen, plus any mandatory costs.
The Borrower may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Facility Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, subject to compensation for customary "break costs" and certain other requirements. The Borrower is required to prepay loans with certain insurance proceeds, and the loans are subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of a change of control, material asset disposal or termination of the construction of Plants 5 and 6, each as described in the Facility Agreement.

In addition, the Borrower's obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by the Company pursuant to the Facility Agreement.
The Facility Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Borrower to incur indebtedness, create liens, effect asset sales, engage in reorganizations, issue guarantees and make loans. In addition, the Facility Agreement includes financial covenants relating to net total leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio, total debt to equity ratio, debt service coverage ratio and tangible net worth. The Facility Agreement also contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.

First Solar Announces Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results
TEMPE, Ariz. - Aug. 4, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2011. Net sales were $533 million in the quarter, a decrease of $34.5 million from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower average selling prices (ASPs) as solar photovoltaic (PV) policy uncertainties in Italy, Germany and France adversely impacted demand in the second quarter. Quarterly net sales decreased from $588 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower ASPs and a decrease in revenue recognized by the systems business, partially offset by higher module volume.
Second quarter net income per fully diluted share was $0.70, down from $1.33 in the first quarter of 2011 and $1.84 in the second quarter of 2010. Quarter over quarter, the net income decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs and a higher tax rate, partially offset by higher volume sold. Year over year, the net income decrease was principally driven by lower ASPs and increased investment in the Utilities Systems Business and research and development.
First Solar continued to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market, and our 2011 outlook remains solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. We expect stronger performance in the second half of 2011 as we build projects from our systems pipeline, develop promising new markets, execute our cost reduction roadmaps and continue to improve module efficiencies.
First Solar's updated 2011 guidance is as follows:
  
First Solar will discuss these results and the outlook for 2011 in a conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Investors may access a live audio webcast of this conference call and the earnings call presentation, which includes guidance for 2011 and additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, in the Investors section of the Company's website at www.firstsolar.com.

Mr. Brown, age 48, joined First Solar in 2008 as Vice President, Project Finance, and has been involved in project finance and business development during his tenure.

safe harbor amount), in which case payments shall be reduced to the safe harbor amount.
Mr. Brown is subject to certain restrictions on competition and solicitation during his employment with First Solar and for one year thereafter, as well as separate confidentiality and intellectual property obligations, each pursuant to agreements the terms of which are consistent in all material respects to those that First Solar has previously entered into with its executive officers.

If such event or events are cured during such period, then the Executive will not be permitted to terminate employment for Good Reason as the result of such event or events. If the Company does not cure such event or events in such period, the termination of employment by the Executive for Good Reason shall be effective on the thirtieth (30
th
) day following the date when the Notice of Termination for Good Reason is given, unless the Company elects to treat such termination as effective as of an earlier date; provided, however, that so long as an event that constitutes Good Reason occurs during the Protection Period and the Executive delivers the Notice of Termination for Good Reason within ninety (90) days following the occurrence of such event, the Company is provided with at least thirty (30) days following the delivery of such Notice of Termination for Good Reason to cure such event, and the Executive terminates his employment as of the thirtieth (30
th

SECTION 2.
Effectiveness and Term.
This Agreement was originally effective on December 31, 2007 (the Effective Date). This Agreement shall remain in effect until the third (3
rd
) anniversary of the Effective Date, except that, beginning on the second anniversary of the Effective Date and on each anniversary thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically extended for an additional one-year period, unless the Company or the Executive provides the other party with sixty (60) days' prior written notice before the applicable anniversary that the term of this Agreement shall not be so extended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control during the term of this Agreement (whether the original term or the term as extended), this Agreement shall not thereafter terminate, and the term hereof

SECTION 3.

Effective as of the Change in Control Date, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, other than any such provision that expressly provides that this Section 3 of this Agreement does not apply (which provision shall be given full force and effect), in any of the Company's equity-based, equity-related or other long-term incentive compensation plans, practices, policies and programs (including the Company's 2003 Unit Option Plan and the Company's 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan) or any award agreements thereunder, (a) all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and similar rights and awards then held by the Executive that are unexercisable or otherwise unvested shall automatically become fully vested and immediately exercisable, as the case may be, (b) all outstanding equity-based, equity-related and other long-term incentive awards then held by the Executive that are subject to performance-based vesting criteria shall automatically become fully vested and earned at a deemed performance level equal to the maximum performance level with respect to such awards and (c) all other outstanding equity-based, equity-related and long-term incentive awards, to the extent not covered by the foregoing clause (a) or (b), then held by the Executive that are unvested or subject to restrictions or forfeiture shall automatically become fully vested and all restrictions and forfeiture provisions related thereto shall lapse.
SECTION 4.
Termination of Employment.
(a)
Qualifying Termination.
In the event of a Qualifying Termination, the Executive shall be entitled, subject to Section 4(a)(vi), to the following payments and benefits:
(i)
Severance Pay.
The Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (A) the Executive's Annual Base Salary (without regard to any reduction giving rise to Good Reason) and (B) the Bonus Amount, in a lump-sum cash payment payable on the tenth (10
th
) business day after the Release Effective Date; provided, however, that such amount shall be paid in lieu of, and the Executive hereby waives the right to receive, any other cash severance payment the Executive is otherwise eligible to receive upon termination of employment under any severance plan, practice, policy or program of the Company or any Subsidiary or under any agreement between the Company and the Executive and, in the event of a Qualifying Termination described in clause (iii) of the definition thereof, the severance payment payable pursuant to this Section 4(a)(i) shall be reduced by the amount of any other such severance payments previously paid to the Executive.
(ii)
Prorated Annual Bonus.
The Company shall pay the Executive an amount equal to the product of (A) the Executive's Annual Bonus and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Company's fiscal year containing the Termination Date that the Executive was employed by the Company or any Affiliate, and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365), in a lump-sum payment payable on the tenth (10
th
) business day after the Release Effective Date.
(iii)
Continued Welfare Benefits.
The Company shall, at its option, either (A) continue to provide medical, life insurance, accident insurance and disability benefits to the Executive and the Executive's spouse and dependents at least equal to the benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries generally to other active peer executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (B) pay Executive the cost of obtaining equivalent coverage, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), for a period of time commencing on the Termination Date and ending on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Termination Date; provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare
benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. Any provision of benefits pursuant to this Section 4(a)(iii) in one (1) tax year of the Executive (the 
Executive Tax Year
) shall not affect the amount of such benefits to be provided in any other Executive Tax Year. The right to such benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Executive agrees to make (and to cause his dependents to make) a timely election under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (
COBRA
) to the extent requested by Employer, to facilitate Employer's provision of continuation coverage.
(iv)
Accrued Rights.
The Executive shall be entitled to (A) payments of any unpaid
salary, bonuses or other amount earned or accrued through the Termination Date and reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses incurred through the Termination Date (B) any payments explicitly set forth in any other benefit plans, practices, policies and programs in which the Executive participates and (C) any payments the Company is or becomes obligated to make pursuant to Sections 5, 7 and 12 (the rights to such payments, the Accrued Rights). The Accrued Rights payable pursuant to Section 4(a)(iv)(A) and Section 4(a)(iv)(B) shall be payable on their respective otherwise scheduled payment dates,
provided
that any amounts payable in respect of accrued but unused vacation shall be paid in a lump sum within 15 days following the Termination Date. The Accrued Rights payable pursuant to Section 4(a)(iv)(C) shall be payable at the times set forth in the applicable Section hereof.
(v)
Outplacement.
The Company shall reimburse the Executive for individual outplacement services to be provided by a firm of the Executive's choice or, at the Executive's election, provide the Executive with the use of office space, office supplies and secretarial assistance satisfactory to the Executive. The aggregate expenditures of the Company pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed Twenty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($20,000). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the outplacement benefits under this Section 4(a)(v) shall be provided to the Executive for no longer than the one-year period following the Termination Date, and the amount of any outplacement benefits or office space, office supplies and secretarial assistance provided to the Executive in any Executive Tax Year shall not affect the amount of any such outplacement benefits or office space, office supplies and secretarial assistance provided to the Executive in any other Executive Tax Year.
(vi)
Release of Claims.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, unless on or prior to the tenth (10
th
) business day prior to March 15 of the year following the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Executive has executed and delivered a Separation Agreement and Release (the Release) substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the employment agreement between the Executive and the Company and such Release has become effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms, (A) no payments shall be paid or made available to the Executive under Section 4(a)(i) or 4(a)(ii), (B) the Company shall be relieved of all obligations to provide or make available any further benefits to the Executive pursuant to Section 4(a)(iii) and 4(a)(v) and (C) the Executive shall be required to repay the Company, in cash, within five business days after written demand is made therefor by the Company, an amount equal to the value of any benefits received by the Executive pursuant to Section 4(a)(iii) and 4(a)(v) prior to such date.
(b)
Termination on Account of Death or Disability; Non-Qualifying Termination.
(i) In the event of any termination of Executive's employment other than a Qualifying Termination (for example, on account of death or Disability), the Executive shall not be entitled to any additional payments or benefits from the Company under this Agreement, other than payments or benefits with respect to the Accrued Rights.
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have a
Disability in the event of the Executive's absence for a period of 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to a physical or mental condition, illness or injury that is determined to be total and permanent by a physician mutually acceptable to the Company and the Executive or the Executive's legal representative (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld) after such physician has completed an examination of the Executive. The Executive agrees to make himself available for such examination upon the reasonable request of the Company, and the Company shall be responsible for the cost of such examination.
SECTION 5.
Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment that is paid or payable during the term of this Agreement would be subject to the Excise Tax, the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a 280G Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any income and employment taxes and Excise Taxes imposed upon the 280G Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the 280G Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon such Payments. The Company's obligation to make 280G Gross-Up Payments under this Section 5 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment and shall survive and apply after the Executive's termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a 280G Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the greatest amount that could be paid to the Executive without giving rise to any Excise Tax (the Safe Harbor Amount), then no 280G Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Payments, in the aggregate, are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount. If such a reduction is necessary, the Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (i) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(i) (severance), (ii) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(ii) (prorated annual bonus), (iii) any other cash Payments, (iv) the Payments payable under Section 4(a)(iii) (welfare benefit continuation) and (v) the accelerated vesting under Section 3.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when a 280G Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such 280G Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Section 5 by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that shall be designated by the Executive (the Accounting Firm). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. For purposes of determining the amount of any 280G GrossUp Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay Federal income tax at the highest marginal rate applicable to individuals in the calendar year in which any such 280G GrossUp Payment is to be made and deemed to pay state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates applicable to individuals in the state or locality of the Executive's residence or place of employment in the calendar year in which any such 280G GrossUp Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of state and local taxes, taking into account limitations applicable to individuals subject to Federal income tax at the highest marginal rate. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any 280G Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 5, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall so indicate to the Executive in writing. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, at the time of the initial determination
by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that 280G Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an Underpayment), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 5(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination.
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any written claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of a 280G Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim. Failure to give timely notice shall not prejudice the Executive's right to 280G Gross-Up Payments and rights of indemnity under this Section 5. The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall
:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company, (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional income taxes, interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claim on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one (1) or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that (A) if the Company pays the tax claim on behalf of the Executive and directs the Executive to sue for a refund, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties) imposed with respect to such payment and (B) if such contest results in any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due, such extension must be limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the 280G Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
(d) If, after the payment by the Company of any tax claim pursuant to Section 5(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 5(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund received (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the payment by the Company of any tax claim pursuant to Section 5(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of the thirty (30)
day period after such determination, then the amount the Company paid in respect of such claim shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of 280G Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall any 280G Gross-Up Payments be made by the Company to the Executive under this Section 5 after the end of the Executive Tax Year following the Executive Tax Year in which the Executive remits the taxes for which such 280G Gross-Up Payment is required to be made under this Section 5, and (ii) no other payments will be made by the Company to the Executive under this Section 5 with respect to any audit or litigation relating to any 280G Gross-Up Payment or Excise Tax or other taxes after the Executive Tax Year following the Executive Tax Year in which the taxes that are the subject of the audit or litigation referred to in this Section 5 are remitted to the taxing authority, or where
,
as a result of such audit or litigation
,
no taxes are remitted, the end of the Executive Tax Year following the Executive Tax Year in which the audit is completed or there is a final and nonappealable settlement or other resolution of the litigation.
SECTION 6.
Section 409A.
(a) It is intended that the provisions of this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code, as amended, and the regulations thereunder as in effect from time to time (collectively, 
Section 409A
), and all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted either to (i) exempt any compensation from the application of Section 409A, or (ii) comply with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A.
(b) Neither the Executive nor any creditor or beneficiary of the Executive shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable under this Agreement or under any other plan, policy, arrangement or agreement of or with the Company or any of its Affiliates (this Agreement and such other plans, policies, arrangements and agreements, the Company Plans) to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment. Except as permitted under Section 409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) payable to or for the benefit of the Executive under any Company Plan may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by the Executive to the Company or any of its Affiliates.
(c) If, at the time of the Executive's separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A), (i) the Executive shall be a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A and using the identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time) and (ii) the Company shall make a good faith determination that an amount payable under a Company Plan constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to the six-month delay rule set forth in Section 409A to avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A, then the Company (or an Affiliate thereof, as applicable) shall not pay such amount on the otherwise scheduled payment date but shall instead accumulate such amount and pay it, without interest, on the first day of the seventh month following such separation from service.
SECTION 7.
No Mitigation or Offset; Enforcement of this Agreement.
(a) The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action that the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.
(b) The Company shall reimburse, upon the Executive's demand, any and all reasonable legal fees and expenses that the Executive may incur in good faith prior to the second anniversary of the expiration of the term of this Agreement as a result of any contest, dispute or proceeding (regardless of whether formal legal proceedings are ever commenced and regardless of the outcome thereof and including all stages of any contest, dispute or proceeding) by the Company, the Executive or any other Person with respect to the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive regarding the amount of any payment owed pursuant to this Agreement), and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any tax (including Excise Tax) imposed on the Executive as a result of payment by the Company of such legal fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) any reimbursement for any fees and expenses under this Section 7 shall be made promptly and no later than the end of the Executive Tax Year following the Executive Tax Year in which the fees or expenses are incurred, (ii) the amount of fees and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Section 7 during any Executive Tax Year shall not affect the fees and expenses eligible for reimbursement in another Executive Tax Year, (iii) no right to reimbursement under this Section 7 shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other payment or benefit, and (iv) no tax gross up payments shall be made by the Company under this Section 7 after the end of the Executive Tax Year following the Executive Tax Year in which the related taxes are remitted.
SECTION 8.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
Except as specifically provided in Section 4(a)(i), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, practice, policy or program provided by the Company or a Subsidiary for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything in this Agreement limit or otherwise affect any rights the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary. Vested benefits and other amounts that the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any incentive compensation (including any equity award agreement), deferred compensation, retirement, pension or other plan, practice, policy or program of, or any contract or agreement with, the Company or a Subsidiary shall be payable in accordance with the terms of each such plan, practice, policy, program, contract or agreement, as the case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.
SECTION 9.
Withholding.
The Company may deduct and withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes as are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
SECTION 10.
Assignment.
(a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be void.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 10(a), this Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee or other designee or, should there be no such designee, to the Executive's estate.
(c) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company (a 
Successor
)
to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. If there shall be a Successor, (i) the term Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any Successor and any permitted assignee to which this Agreement is assigned and (ii) the term Board shall mean the Board as hereinbefore defined and the board of directors or equivalent governing body of any Successor and any permitted assignee to which this Agreement is assigned.
SECTION 11.
Dispute Resolution.
(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Executive and the Company each hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court of Delaware (or, if subject matter jurisdiction in that court is not available, in any state court located within the city of Wilmington, Delaware) over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the parties undertake not to commence any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in a forum other than a forum described in this Section 11(a); provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the Company or the Executive from bringing any suit, action or proceeding in any other court for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this Section 11 or enforcing any judgment obtained by the Company or the Executive.
(b) The agreement of the parties to the forum described in Section 11(a) is independent of the law that may be applied in any suit, action or proceeding and the parties agree to such forum even if such forum may under applicable law choose to apply non-forum law. The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that they now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in an applicable court described in Section 11(a), and the parties agree that they shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court. The parties agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a final and non-appealable judgment in any suit, action or proceeding brought in any applicable court described in Section 11(a) shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction.
(c) The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of any and all process in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement by the mailing of copies of such process to such party at such party's address specified in Section 18.
(d) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 11(d).
SECTION 12.
Default in Payment.
Any payment not made within ten (10) business days after it is due in accordance with this Agreement shall thereafter bear interest, compounded annually, at the prime rate in effect from time to time at Citibank, N.A., or any successor thereto. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the corresponding payment is payable.
SECTION 13.
GOVERNING LAW.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.
SECTION 14.
Amendment; No Waiver.
No provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified, waived or discharged except by a written document signed by the Executive and a duly authorized officer of the Company. The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 1(t), no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or power hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment of any steps to enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.
SECTION 15.
Severability.
If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon any such determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
SECTION 16.

First Solar Announces Departure of Jens Meyerhoff
Jim Brown Appointed President of Utility Systems Business Group
TEMPE, Ariz., Aug. 16, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) today announced that Jens Meyerhoff, President of the Utility Systems Business Group (USBG) and former Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will be leaving the company effective Sept. 30, 2011. James Brown, currently Senior Vice President of Utility Systems Business Sales, will succeed Meyerhoff, reporting to Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. In addition, Frank DeRosa will assume an expanded role in USBG as Senior Vice President of Business Development for the Americas, reporting to Brown.
"Jens has been an instrumental part of our growth, both as CFO and leading the Utility Systems business. He has always been equally passionate about both our business success and our long-term vision to build sustainable solar markets. We thank Jens for his dedication and wish him the best," said Gillette. "Jim is an experienced leader with a proven track record who has been deeply involved in the creation and execution of our USBG strategy, so we are confident the transition will be seamless."
Over the past five and a half years I had the privilege to be part of building the leading franchise in the PV solar industry. I am very proud of what we have achieved, not only financially, but also in building the foundation for a sustainable global market for solar power," said Meyerhoff. With the full integration of our past acquisitions, the formation of a world-class Utility Systems team with a strong leader like Jim stepping up, as well as the completion of major project milestones such as the sale of Agua Caliente and the construction start of Desert Sunlight, First Solar is well-positioned for the future. The company has now reached a size and scale that allows me to step back and self-reflect before deciding my next step in life."
Meyerhoff joined First Solar in May 2006 as CFO and led First Solar through the transformation from private to publicly traded company through its initial public stock offering in November 2006. Meyerhoff led the creation of First Solar's Utility Systems business and was appointed President of the Utility Systems Business Group in July 2010.
James Brown joined First Solar in 2008 as Vice President, Project Finance, and has been involved in project finance and business development during his tenure. He currently is responsible for leading the wholesale systems sales business in the Americas and Asia-Pacific and has been instrumental in financing and selling First Solar's self-developed portfolio of projects aggregating over 1.8 GW. Prior to joining First Solar, Brown worked for approximately 20 years in banking covering project and structured finance for the energy and industrial sectors. He earned a B.S. degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point and was a Captain in the U.S. Army where he was a helicopter pilot and commanded an Air Cavalry troop.
In his new role, Frank DeRosa will add Business Development and Sales to his Project Development responsibilities in USBG for the Americas. DeRosa joined First Solar in 2010 as Senior Vice President of Project Development when First Solar acquired NextLight Renewable Power, where he was founder and CEO. Prior to that, DeRosa worked for 23 years at Pacific Gas & Electric Company in both the regulated and unregulated business units, including running PG&E's RPS procurement program and the independent power plant subsidiary's development activities. He earned a B.S. degree from Boston University and a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On September 30, 2011, First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) issued a press release announcing the closing of the sale of Desert Sunlight, a 550-megawatt solar photovoltaic project under development in Riverside County, California, to affiliates of GE Energy Financial Services, Inc. and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (the Owners). A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K, and Questions and Answers regarding the transaction are attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.
Subsequent to the sale, subsidiaries of First Solar have entered into engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts and operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts with Desert Sunlight entities. These contracts subject First Solar and its subsidiaries to risks customary to such contracts, including risks related to permitting, construction, commodity prices, satisfactory completion and other risks described under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
In addition, under certain possible limited circumstances relating to project permitting during the construction period, First Solar may be required to make a payment to the Owners that approximates a repayment of the amounts received from the project sale and under the EPC contracts plus the net outstanding accrued interest and other amounts owing to the project lenders and other project costs incurred less available energy revenues the Owners have received from the project at the time of such payment (the Repayment). In such event, ownership of Desert Sunlight would be transferred to a subsidiary of First Solar or sold for its benefit reducing the Repayment amount, with First Solar retaining exclusive rights to perform EPC and O&M services for the project.
First Solar will recognize revenue for the project when all revenue recognition criteria under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been met, which as a result of these arrangements is not currently expected to occur until construction is substantially complete. First Solar expects to substantially complete construction by the first quarter of 2015. Notwithstanding that revenue is not currently expected to be recognized under GAAP until construction is substantially complete, First Solar subsidiaries will receive cash payments under the terms of the EPC contracts upon achievement of certain construction milestones throughout the construction period. Because any Repayment includes the amounts received by First Solar under the EPC contracts, the amount of such Repayment would increase as EPC payments are received by First Solar.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
First Solar Sells 550-Megawatt Desert Sunlight Solar Farm, Among World's Largest
Hiring already under way of up to 630 people
                                                                      
TEMPE, Ariz., September 30, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq:FSLR) today announced completion of the sale of one of the world's largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power projects - the 550-megawatt (AC) Desert Sunlight Solar Farm near Desert Center, Calif.
First Solar - which will continue to build and subsequently operate and maintain the project under separate agreements - has sold the project to
affiliates of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, the competitive energy subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and GE Energy Financial Services.
First Solar
estimates that Desert Sunlight will employ up to 630 people for construction, which has begun. Converting sunlight into electricity, the solar power project will provide enough clean, affordable energy to power approximately 160,000 California homes and displace 300,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year - equivalent to taking 60,000 cars off the road. Total indirect local economic benefits to Riverside County, where the solar project is located, are estimated at $336 million, the majority of which will be generated during construction with the remainder over the minimum 25-year operating period (according to an economic benefits study by Coachella Valley Economic Partnership and The Brattle Group), including nearly $200 million in wages. Indirect benefits result from local business-to-business transactions, for example local purchase of building materials. The project is expected to contribute approximately $27 million in sales and property tax revenue to the county. Desert Sunlight will also help California meet its target of generating 33 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020.
Tapping the Desert's Sun
The project is located 35 miles west of Blythe and six miles north of Desert Center in the Chuckwalla Valley on approximately 3,800 acres - with 200 more acres for related infrastructure -- of largely vacant land managed by the
Bureau of Land Management. First Solar will install its advanced thin-film PV modules, which convert sunlight into electricity without producing emissions or waste or using water. First Solar will supply some modules from a new $300 million factory it is building in Mesa, Ariz., that will employ 600 people to support Desert Sunlight and other U.S. PV projects. Project construction began this month, with full commercial operation expected in the first quarter of 2015.
Funding from Equity and Debt
Affiliates of NextEra Energy Resources and GE Energy Financial Services have each acquired 50 percent of the Desert Sunlight project. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. A NextEra Energy Resources' affiliate will manage the project.
The Desert Sunlight project's power will be sold under two long-term power purchase agreements: a 250-megawatt agreement with Southern California Edison and a 300-megawatt agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
The U.S. Department of Energy Loan Program Office on September 29 approved a loan guarantee for the project. The project will not receive any cash from the government through the loan guarantee; rather the DOE is partially guaranteeing $1.46 billion in loans provided by a syndicate of private institutional investors and commercial banks headed by lead lenders Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and Citigroup. The loan guarantee expanded the pool of potential lenders to the project, encouraging development and deployment of clean energy, jobs and reduction of the country's reliance on fossil fuels.
We are pleased to be able to expand our position as North America's leading generator of solar power, said NextEra Energy Resources President and CEO Mitch Davidson. Acquiring a 50 percent interest in the Desert Sunlight project is consistent with our strategy to add fully contracted clean energy to our portfolio.
First Solar is excited about the sale of such a ground-breaking PV solar project, which will have profound environmental and economic benefits, said Frank De Rosa, First Solar Senior Vice President of Business Development--Americas. We look forward to working closely with the new owners as we build and operate the facility, bringing jobs, renewable power and energy security to California and the United States.
In connection with the sale of Desert Sunlight, First Solar is filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. First Solar investors should refer to such Form 8-K, as it contains important additional information, including information related to revenue recognition for the project and certain possible payments that apply to First Solar. In addition, questions and answers regarding the Desert Sunlight transaction are included as Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K and can also be found at http://investor.firstsolar.com.

NEWS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                        
Exelon to Expand its Clean Energy Fleet with Acquisition of
230-Megawatt Solar Photovoltaic Project from First Solar
Up to $1.36 billion investment in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One bolsters
Exelon's emission-free energy portfolio
CHICAGO and TEMPE, Ariz. (Sept. 30, 2011)
- Exelon Corporation today announced its acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One, a 230-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) project under development in northern Los Angeles County, Calif., from First Solar, which developed and will build, operate, and maintain the project. Construction has started, with the first portion of the site expected to come online in late 2012 and full operation planned for late 2013.
When fully operational, AV Solar Ranch One will be one of the largest PV solar projects in the world, with approximately 3.8 million solar panels generating enough clean, renewable electricity to power the equivalent of 75,000 average homes per year. The project has a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA), approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, with Pacific Gas & Electric for the full output of the plant.
This project reinforces Exelon's industry-leading clean energy position, creates shareholder value and gives Exelon real scale in solar power, said John W. Rowe, Exelon chairman and CEO. As the nation continues its transition to a clean energy future, our experience with AV Solar Ranch One will give us a clear competitive advantage.
Exelon expects the total investment of up to $1.36 billion to be accretive to earnings beginning in 2013 and free cash flow accretive starting in 2013. The project is value accretive, and will have stable earnings and cash flow profiles due to the PPA. Exelon expects to invest up to $713 million in equity in the project through 2013.
We are pleased to be working with Exelon to realize the AV Solar Ranch One project, providing clean, affordable energy and hundreds of construction jobs to California, said Frank De Rosa, First Solar senior vice president, business development-Americas.
The U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office finalized a loan guarantee of up to $646 million to support project financing for AV Solar Ranch One. Advances under the loan are contingent on the satisfaction of various conditions. No regulatory approvals are needed for Exelon's acquisition of AV Solar Ranch One from First Solar.
In connection with the sale of AV Solar Ranch One, First Solar is filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. First Solar investors should refer to such Form 8-K, as it contains important additional information, including information related to revenue recognition for the project.
The project will deliver economic benefits to the local community and the state of California, including the generation of state and local tax revenues and creation of up to a peak of 400 construction jobs and up to 15 ongoing operations and maintenance positions, with an emphasis on hiring workers from the local area.
This project demonstrates how
Exelon 2020
, the company's business and environmental strategy, delivers value through clean, low-carbon energy investments. When fully operational, AV Solar Ranch One will displace approximately 140,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year - the equivalent of taking approximately 30,000 cars off the road. Plus, it will generate electricity with no water use, no air emissions and no waste production. Exelon's existing solar assets include Exelon City Solar, the nation's largest urban solar power plant, which is located on the South Side of Chicago and was completed in 2010.
The project will be built on 2,100 acres of fallow farmland near Lancaster, Calif., in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert, approximately 80 miles north of Los Angeles. The transaction expands Exelon's geographic presence into California, an attractive solar market with an ambitious renewable energy policy and some of the best PV resources in the world.
AV Solar Ranch One will employ First Solar's FS Series 3 PV Module and deploy its tracking system on a portion of the facility. The technology will increase electricity output by tilting the solar panels to track the daily path of the sun. The project also will feature innovative inverters with voltage regulation and monitoring technologies, which provide more stable and continuous power, increasing the project's efficiency and reliability.
The transaction follows Exelon's April 28 announcement that it plans to merge with Constellation Energy, which will combine two of the industry's leading clean energy generation fleets. With the addition of AV Solar Ranch One, their combined solar portfolio will include approximately 350 MW in operation and under construction. Constellation is a competitive electricity supplier and solar project developer in California and owns five solar projects in the state totaling more than 32 MW.
The acquisition of AV Solar Ranch One adds to the nearly $5 billion Exelon has said it plans to invest in cost-effective clean energy projects between 2010 and 2015. These projects also include uprates to Exelon's nuclear fleet and the acquisition of John Deere Renewables (now Exelon Wind) in 2010, which added 735 MWs to the company's portfolio of clean, renewable energy.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor and Sidley Austin served as legal advisors to Exelon, McDermott Will & Emery advised Exelon for certain tax matters, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as legal advisors to First Solar. SAIC Energy, Environment & Infrastructure, LLC, formerly R. W. Beck, Inc., provided independent technical advisory services.

First Solar Announces Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results
TEMPE, Ariz. - Oct. 26, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2011. Net sales were
$1,006 million
in the quarter, an increase of $473 million from the second quarter of 2011. Quarterly net sales increased from
$798 million
in the third quarter of 2010.

in the third quarter of 2010.
Third quarter Cash and Marketable Securities increased $279 million quarter over quarter to $795 million.
First Solar's performance in the quarter reflects our superior technology, strong execution capability, and integrated business model - all of which have enabled us to weather a difficult market environment relatively well, said Mike Ahearn, Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer of First Solar. Going forward, our goal is not just to survive the current environment, but to transcend it by creating and expanding markets worldwide that do not depend on today's subsidy programs. This requires that we re-focus our strategy and commit our resources to solving the pressing energy needs that exist in much of the world.
With respect to Rob Gillette's departure, Ahearn said, We thank Rob for his service, but the Board of Directors believes First Solar needed a leadership change to navigate through the industry turmoil and achieve our long-term goals.
First Solar's updated 2011 guidance is as follows:
In preparation for 2012, the company is reducing capital expenditures and evaluating opportunities to reallocate overhead expenses to fund increased investments in market development, sales, and R&D.

ARTICLE VIII
Indemnification
Section 1.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than those by or in the Right of the Corporation.
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Section 2.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation.
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.
Section 3.
Authorization of Indemnification.
Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (b) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (c) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (d) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 4.
Good Faith Defined.
For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if his or her action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term another enterprise as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Section 5.
Indemnification by a Court.
Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director, officer, employee or agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director, officer, employee or agent seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director, officer, employee or agent seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Section 6.
Expenses Payable in Advance.
Expenses incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 7.
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise.
Section 8.
Insurance.
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
Section 9.
Certain Definitions.
For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Article VIII.
Section 10.
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 11.
Limitation on Indemnification.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 of this Article VIII), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
ARTICLE IX
Amendments
Section 1.
Amendment, etc.
The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. Bylaws adopted by the Board of Directors may be repealed or changed, and new Bylaws made, by the stockholders, and the stockholders may prescribe that any Bylaw made by them shall not be altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On December 13, 2011, executive management of First Solar, Inc. (First Solar or the Company) approved a set of restructuring initiatives intended to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency. In connection with these restructuring initiatives, First Solar expects to incur total charges of up to $85 million, the majority of which is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. These charges consist primarily of (i) up to $75 million of asset impairment and associated charges (of which up to approximately $63 million is expected to be non-cash) related to a significant reduction in certain research and development activities that had been focused on an alternative photovoltaic ("PV") product, and (ii) up to $10 million in severance benefits to terminated employees as described below, most of which is expected to be paid out by the end of the fourth quarter of 2012. First Solar will be refocusing its research and development center in Santa Clara, California on the development of advanced CdTe PV technologies, compared to a broader research and development effort up until now. First Solar expects as part of the restructuring initiatives to eliminate up to 100 positions company-wide, representing less than 1.5% of First Solar's global workforce, including approximately 85 employees in the U.S. Approximately 70% of the expected reduction in the U.S. workforce relates to the above-referenced refocusing of research and development activities.

As a result of the reorganization, TK Kallenbach, President of the Components Business Group (CBG), will leave First Solar effective Jan. 1, 2012.
In addition, First Solar has reorganized the structure and roles in its finance and accounting groups to optimize efficiency. As a result, James Zhu, Chief Accounting Officer, has elected to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will add the role of Chief Accounting Officer to his responsibilities effective Feb. 1, 2012, and Zhu will remain with First Solar through May 1, 2012 to ensure a smooth transition.
"We thank TK and James for their dedication and for their commitment to helping us build sustainable global markets for solar electricity, said Mike Ahearn, Chairman and interim CEO of First Solar. These changes support our broader effort to reposition First Solar to lead the industry through the current market turbulence, and to better serve our customers around the world with comprehensive solar energy solutions.
First Solar is uniquely positioned in the PV (photovoltaic) industry to have a deep and meaningful impact on the future of electricity generation, and it has been rewarding to be a part of that success, said Kallenbach.
Brown joined First Solar in 2008 as Vice President, Project Finance, and was appointed President of the Utility Systems business in Aug. 2011. Prior to joining First Solar, Brown worked in banking for approximately 20 years covering project and structured finance for the energy and industrial sectors.
Widmar joined First Solar as CFO in April 2011 from Graftech International Ltd., where he was CFO. Prior to joining Graftech in 2006, he held senior positions in finance and controlling at NCR, Dell, and Lucent Technologies. Widmar is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).

EXHIBIT 99.2
First Solar Updates 2011 Financial Guidance and Announces 2012 Financial Guidance
TEMPE, Ariz., Dec. 14, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) today updated the Company's 2011 financial guidance and announced 2012 guidance.
First Solar now forecasts 2011 net sales in the range of $2.8 to $2.9 billion, down from the Company's prior guidance range for net sales of $3.0 to $3.3 billion. The Company expects diluted earnings per share (EPS) for 2011 to be in the range of $5.75 to $6.00, with consolidated operating income of $575 to $600 million. The primary reason for the revised 2011 guidance is continued delays of certain projects in First Solar's systems business due to weather and other factors.
Not included in the revised guidance are expected charges related to a series of initiatives to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency, the majority of which the Company expects to incur in the current quarter. These charges include up to $0.75 per fully diluted share of impairment and associated charges primarily related to certain equipment, and a severance charge of up to $0.10 per fully diluted share related to a workforce reduction of approximately 100 associates, less than 1.5 percent of First Solar's workforce.
For 2012, First Solar forecasts net sales in the range of $3.7 to $4.0 billion, including approximately $1.7 billion from the systems business. Diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.75 to $4.25, and consolidated operating income is expected to be $425 to $450 million. The Company expects to generate $0.9 to $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and plans for approximately $375-$425 million in capital investment in 2012.
Our diverse business model and robust project pipeline will help First Solar generate a significant amount of cash in 2012 while improving operational efficiencies, but we are recalibrating our business to focus on building and serving sustainable markets rather than pursuing subsidized markets, said Mike Ahearn, Chairman and Interim CEO of First Solar. By channeling our core strength in utility-scale PV systems to markets with immediate need for mass-scale renewable energy our goal is to earn substantially all of our new revenues from sustainable markets by the end of 2014."
First Solar will discuss the Company's revised 2011 guidance and outlook for 2012 in a conference call scheduled for today at 8:00 a.m. EST. Investors may access a live audio webcast of this call and presentation in the Investors section of the Company's website at www.firstsolar.com.
An audio replay of the conference call will also be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a federal loan and loan guarantee of up to $646 million to support project financing for the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (AVSR) project, a 230-megawatt solar photovoltaic project in northern Los Angeles County, California, which First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) developed, sold to Exelon Corporation and will build, operate and maintain. Construction of AVSR has been proceeding; however, initial funding of the DOE loan for AVSR has not yet occurred pending resolution of an outstanding construction permit issue. As described in the September 30, 2011 Form 8-K, advances under the loan are contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions and the parties agreed that First Solar would repurchase AVSR if initial funding of the loan did not occur within approximately four months. Because all conditions have not yet been satisfied, the parties have agreed to extend the timeframe for initial funding of the loan to February 24, 2012. If initial funding of the loan has not occurred by such date and such date is not extended further, First Solar would repurchase AVSR for an amount equal to the purchase price paid by Exelon for the project, approximately $75 million, plus certain other costs incurred by Exelon related to the project. If First Solar were to repurchase AVSR, the reacquired project would then become available for sale by First Solar to another party. First Solar expects its current cash and other capital resources would be sufficient to enable First Solar to repurchase AVSR, if necessary, while meeting First Solar's working capital and capital expenditure needs. First Solar expects to begin recognizing revenue for AVSR following initial funding of the loan.

EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and 2011 Financial Results
 
TEMPE, Ariz. - Feb. 28, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. Fourth quarter 2011 net sales were $660 million, a decrease of $345 million from the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition in our systems business and lower volume for module-only sales. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, quarterly net sales increased $50 million from $610 million. Net sales for 2011 were $2.8 billion, up about 8% from fiscal year 2010.
Fourth quarter net loss per fully diluted share was $4.78, compared to a net income per fully diluted share of $2.25 in the third quarter of 2011 and $1.80 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $393 million (reducing EPS by $3.90) associated with a non-cash goodwill impairment for our components business, $164 million (reducing EPS by $1.67) related to warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expense, and $60 million (reducing EPS by $0.43) related to restructuring activities, as announced in December 2011. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter 2011 was $1.26. Net loss per share in 2011 was $0.46, compared to a net income per fully diluted share of $7.68 in 2010. Excluding the fourth-quarter 2011 charges listed above as well as $46.9 million of warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expensed earlier this year, non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $6.01 for 2011. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), please see tables below.
 
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the fourth quarter were $788 million, down slightly from $795 million at the end of the third quarter.
First Solar achieved several milestones in 2011:
1
First Solar's performance in the quarter was impacted by an aggressive competitive environment, an uncertain regulatory environment, warranty-related charges, and restructuring costs incurred to help position our business for the future, said Mike Ahearn, Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer of First Solar. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make strides reducing manufacturing costs, increasing module efficiency, and successfully building out our captive project pipeline. These improvements, combined with our recent restructuring and strategic repositioning, enhance our competitive position in a very challenging environment.
First Solar is updating 2012 guidance as follows:
First Solar has scheduled a conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST on February 28, 2012 to discuss the fourth quarter results and updated 2012 guidance. Investors may access a live webcast of this conference call by visiting

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items:  Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense, Goodwill Impairment and Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share.
Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expense primarily reflect estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected future costs.
Goodwill Impairment:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, goodwill impairment primarily represents a write-down of most of the goodwill we booked from our acquisitions of OptiSolar in 2009 and NextLight in 2010. We exclude the impairment of goodwill from our non-GAAP measures because it does not reflect future performance, does not affect our cash position, and does not affect our cash flows from operating activities.
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs due to certain research and development activities we are no longer pursuing outside of our core technology, as well as severance for headcount reductions. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On April 16, 2012, executive management of First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar" or the "Company") approved a set of restructuring initiatives intended to reduce costs and align the Company's organization with its long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities. As part of these initiatives, First Solar will substantially reduce its European operations including the closure of its manufacturing operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany by the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, which will reduce headcount by approximately 1,200 positions. Due to the lack of legislative support for utility-scale solar projects in Europe, the Company does not believe there is a business case for continuing manufacturing operations in Germany. Additionally, First Solar will substantially reduce the size of its sales and service support in Mainz, Germany and elsewhere in Europe, which will reduce headcount by approximately 150 positions. First Solar will also be idling indefinitely the capacity of four production lines at its manufacturing center in Kulim, Malaysia beginning in May 2012, which will reduce headcount by approximately 550 positions. These actions, combined with additional reductions in administrative and other staff in North America, will reduce First Solar's workforce by approximately 2,000 associates, nearly 30% of its approximately 6,800 global total.
The restructuring and related initiatives are expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of between $230 million and $350 million, including: (i) between $150 million and $250 million in asset impairments and related charges, primarily related to the Frankfurt (Oder) plant; (ii) between $50 million and $70 million in severance, of which between $40 million and $55 million is related to the Frankfurt (Oder) plant and the Company's other European operations; and (iii) approximately $30 million for repayment of a German government grant related to the Frankfurt (Oder) operations. Substantially all such pre-tax restructuring charges are not expected to have any offsetting tax benefit, and the Company expects to incur between $10 million and $15 million in tax expense associated with such initiatives for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, primarily related to Germany.
In addition, First Solar has voluntarily prepaid all outstanding indebtedness relating to the construction of its second manufacturing plant at Frankfurt (Oder) under that certain Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2011, among First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Luxembourg Branch, as security agent, and the additional finance parties thereto. The total repayment amount of approximately $145 million will be partially offset by the release of approximately $20 million in cash deposits that were previously restricted as security for the loan. In connection with such repayment, First Solar expects to incur approximately $5 million in repayment related expense.
The above-referenced charges are expected to total between $245 million and $370 million, which will be incurred primarily in the first quarter of 2012 with remaining amounts being incurred throughout the remainder of 2012. Of these expected charges, between $80 million and $120 million are expected to be cash expenditures.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
See Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On April 17, 2012, First Solar issued two press releases, a version in the United States and a version in Germany, and will hold a conference call regarding these restructuring initiatives. A copy of these press releases are furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.
The information in this Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liability of that Section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01 Other Information.
In connection with a continuing objective of balancing production capabilities with market demand, the Company will be idling indefinitely the capacity of four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia, which will reduce headcount by approximately 550. Production at the other 20 production lines in Malaysia may be idled temporarily to allow the Company to implement upgraded process technologies as part of its accelerated conversion efficiency improvement initiatives, and to better align production with expected market demand. The Company maintains the flexibility to increase Malaysian manufacturing production to all 24 lines when warranted by increased market demand. In terms of production, the Company expects its global annual manufacturing run-rate capacity exiting 2012 to be approximately 1.7 GW, which represents 24 lines (consisting of 20 lines in Malaysia and four lines in Perrysburg, Ohio) capable of running at a line run-rate of approximately 70 MW per year. The Company expects to produce between approximately 1.4 and 1.7 GW of solar modules in 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
First Solar Restructures Operations to Align With Sustainable Market Opportunities
Frankfurt (Oder) Manufacturing Facility to be Closed;
Four Production Lines in Kulim, Malaysia, to be Indefinitely Idled;
Expected Savings of $100-120 Million Annually; 2012 Restructuring Charges of $245-370 Million;
Company Pays Down $145 Million of Debt
 First Solar, Inc. <NASDAQ: FSLR> today announced it is restructuring its operations in response to deteriorating market conditions in Europe and to reduce costs and align its organization with sustainable market opportunities. As part of this program, First Solar will close its manufacturing operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, the Company will indefinitely idle four production lines at its manufacturing center in Kulim, Malaysia, on May 1, 2012. These actions, combined with other personnel reductions in Europe and the U.S., will reduce First Solar's global workforce by approximately 2,000 positions, about 30 percent of the total.
TEMPE, Ariz., April 17, 2012
The restructuring initiatives are expected to reduce First Solar's costs by $30-60 million this year and $100-120 million annually going forward. In addition, the Company's average manufacturing cost is expected to improve to $0.70-$0.72 per watt in 2012 as a result of the changes, below prior expectations of $0.74 per watt. In 2013 the Company estimates average module manufacturing costs will range from $0.60 to $0.64 per watt.
To achieve these significant cost savings, the Company will record restructuring and other related charges of $245-370 million, of which $80-120 million are cash expenditures, consisting of:
 
 
 
 
First Solar expects to incur these charges primarily during the first quarter of 2012 and the rest over the course of this year. In addition, First Solar has voluntarily paid down approximately $145 million of debt ahead of schedule in 2012, which represents repayment in full for outstanding amounts under the Company's German loan agreement.
"After a thorough analysis, it is clear the European market has deteriorated to the extent that our operations there are no longer economically sustainable, and maintaining those operations is not in the best long-term interest of our stakeholders," said Mike Ahearn, Chairman and Interim CEO of First Solar. "Decisions like this are not easy, especially given how important the European markets and our associates in Europe have been to the development of our Company and the solar industry as a whole. We are committed to treating all affected associates fairly, and to building our relationships with European business partners that are aligned with our strategy of pursuing utility-scale solar opportunities in sustainable markets around the world."
"The solar market has fundamentally changed, and we are quickly adapting our market approach and operations to maintain and build upon our competitive advantage," said Ahearn. "After a period of robust growth, First
Solar is scaled to operate at higher volumes than currently exist following the reduction of subsidies in key legacy markets. As a result, it is essential that we reduce production and decrease expenses to reflect the smaller volume of high-probability demand we forecast. These actions will enable us to focus our resources on developing the markets where we expect to generate significant growth in coming years."

News Release
First Solar Restructures Operations to Align With Sustainable Market Opportunities
Frankfurt (Oder) Manufacturing Facility to be Closed in Q4
 First Solar, Inc. today announced it is restructuring its global operations in response to deteriorating market conditions in Europe and to reduce costs and align its organization with sustainable market opportunities. As part of the restructuring program, First Solar will close its manufacturing operations in Frankfurt (Oder) in the fourth quarter of 2012, eliminating approximately 1,200 positions.
Frankfurt (Oder), April 17, 2012
First Solar also will indefinitely idle four production lines at its manufacturing center in Kulim, Malaysia, on May 1, 2012, eliminating approximately 550 manufacturing positions. These actions, combined with other personnel reductions in the U.S. and Europe, will reduce First Solar's global workforce by approximately 2,000 positions, about 30 percent of the total.
"The vast majority of the European solar market is not currently economically viable without subsidies, and faced with daunting economic challenges, Eurozone leaders have accelerated major reductions in those programs. Incentives for utility-scale solar projects, our core business, have suffered disproportionately. These cuts have had a dramatic impact on demand that makes our European operations no longer economically sustainable, so we must adapt to the new market," said Christopher Burghardt, Managing Director of First Solar GmbH and head of sales for Europe. "We will continue to provide service and support for our product in Europe and will work with our strategic European customers to develop utility-scale power plants in sustainable markets globally."
"We want to acknowledge and express our appreciation to the leaders who created the supportive policies that fostered unprecedented growth in the solar industry over the past five years, which helped make our own growth possible. We are especially grateful to the city of Frankfurt (Oder) and the state of Brandenburg for their unwavering support," said Burghard von Westerholt, Managing Director of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH. "Most importantly, we appreciate the hard work and dedication of our associates, who have always shown their commitment to quality and precision. We know these actions affect people's lives, and we have not taken them lightly. We will work to minimize the impact on our associates and to smooth their transition."
First Solar has scheduled a press conference today, April 17, 2012 at 5:30 p.m. CET in the Berlin Hilton Hotel.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
First Solar, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net sales of $497 million
GAAP EPS loss of $5.20 per fully diluted share after charges of $5.12 per share
Non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.08 per fully diluted share
Raises 2012 guidance for EPS and operating cash flow
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2012. Net sales were $497 million in the quarter, a decrease of $163 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower volumes for module-only sales, and $70 million below the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower average selling prices and lower volumes for module-only sales, which was partially offset by higher systems revenue.
TEMPE, Ariz., May 3, 2012
The Company reported a first quarter net loss of $5.20 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.78 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 and net income of $1.33 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. The first quarter of 2012 was impacted by pre-tax charges consisting of (i) $401 million (reducing EPS by $4.64) related to previously-announced restructuring actions, including asset impairments, and (ii) $43 million (reducing EPS by $0.48) related to costs in excess of normal warranty expense associated with our previously announced 2008 to 2009 manufacturing excursion, including approximately $31 million in accruals which reflect the completion of processing for all remaining claims during the first quarter.
The non-GAAP net loss per fully diluted share, which excludes the charges listed above, was $0.08 for the first quarter. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), see the tables below.
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the first quarter were $750 million, down from $788 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Based on reductions in First Solar's ongoing cost structure related to our restructuring initiatives, the Company is increasing 2012 guidance as follows:
 
 
"First Solar's performance in the quarter was impacted by an aggressive competitive environment resulting from persistent supply-demand imbalances in the market, as well as restructuring costs that will improve our operating efficiency and help position us for the future," said Mike Ahearn, Chairman of the Board. "Looking forward, we are confident we have the right long-term strategy and the right platform to enable long-term growth and value creation. We believe that by executing our strategic roadmaps and completing our restructuring program we can achieve our targets of 2.6 to 3.0 GW of sales in sustainable markets, earning a return on invested capital of 13 to 17 percent by 2016."
First Solar has scheduled a conference call today, May 3, 2012 at 4 30 p.m. EDT to discuss this announcement and its five-year plan. Investors may access a live webcast of this conference call by visiting .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net (loss) income and non-GAAP net (loss) income per share, which adjust for the following items: Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense, and Restructuring. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share.
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expense primarily reflect estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected future costs.
Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.
Restructuring:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On June 29, 2012, First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) announced the appointment of Georges Antoun as Chief Operating Officer, effective July 1, 2012, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer. In this newly created role, Mr. Antoun will have comprehensive leadership responsibility for research & development, manufacturing operations, quality and product management.
Mr. Antoun, age 49, has over 20 years of operational and technical experience, including leadership positions at several global technology companies. Mr. Antoun most recently served as Venture Partner at Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV), a private equity and venture firm that he joined in July 2011. Prior to joining TCV, Mr. Antoun was the Head of Product Area IP & Broadband Networks for Ericsson, based in San Jose, California. Mr. Antoun joined Ericsson in 2007, when Ericsson acquired Redback Networks, a telecommunications equipment company, where Mr. Antoun served as the Senior Vice President of World Wide Sales & Operations. After the acquisition, Mr. Antoun was promoted to Chief Executive Officer of the Redback Networks subsidiary. Prior to Redback Networks, Mr. Antoun spent five years at Cisco Systems, where he served as Vice President of Worldwide Systems Engineering and Field Marketing, Vice President of Worldwide Optical Operations, and Vice President of Carrier Sales. He has also held senior management positions at Newbridge Networks, a data and voice networking company, and Nynex (now Verizon Communications), where he was part of its Science and Technology Division. Mr. Antoun earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and a Masters degree in Information Systems Engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York University.
Mr. Antoun will be entitled to an annual base salary of $550,000 (subject to annual increases at First Solars discretion) and the opportunity to participate in First Solars annual bonus program, with a target bonus percentage of 75% of his annual base salary and an opportunity to earn up to two times his target bonus. Upon his hire, Mr. Antoun will be granted restricted stock units having an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $1,000,000, which will vest commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date at an annual rate of 25% per year, subject to Mr. Antouns continued employment. Mr. Antoun will also be paid a sign-on bonus of $300,000, less applicable withholdings, to facilitate his relocation to Tempe, Arizona and to defray expenses related thereto. Mr. Antoun will also receive a grant of 265,000 performance units under First Solars Key Senior Talent Equity Performance Program (KSTEPP) and will be eligible for future equity grants and other long-term incentives. Mr. Antoun will be eligible to participate in First Solars standard employee benefit programs and will be entitled to benefits and perquisites consistent with those provided to other senior executives of First Solar and any other benefits that First Solar may, in its sole discretion, elect to grant to him from time to time.
In the event of a termination of employment by First Solar without cause, or by Mr. Antoun for good reason within the first two years of employment, in each case, outside the change in control protection period (as described below), Mr. Antoun will receive cash severance equal to 12 months salary continuation, subject to delivery of a release of claims, as well as medical coverage until the earlier of 12 months or such time as Mr. Antoun is covered under a medical benefits plan of a subsequent employer. In addition, in the event Mr. Antouns employment is terminated by First Solar without cause, by Mr. Antoun for good reason within the first two years of employment, or due to his death or disability, in each case, outside the change in control protection period, then any equity award (or portion thereof) that would have vested or become exercisable by its terms within 12 months following the date of Mr. Antouns termination of employment will become vested or exercisable as of the date of his termination of employment.
    
In the event of a termination of Mr. Antouns employment by First Solar without cause or by Mr. Antoun for good reason, in each case, within the two years following a change in control (or by First Solar without cause prior to a change in control at the request of the third party effecting the change in control), such period, the change in control protection period, Mr. Antoun will receive (i) a prorated target bonus, (ii) cash severance equal to two times the sum of (a) his annual salary and (b) the greater of his target bonus or his average bonus during the preceding three years, (iii) continued health and welfare benefits for 18 months, and (iv) up to $20,000 in expenses for outplacement services, all subject to delivery of a release of claims. In the event of a change in control, Mr. Antoun will receive full vesting of all of his equity awards, other than his KSTEPP award, which is subject to its own change in control vesting terms.

EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net sales of $957 million
GAAP EPS of $1.27 per fully diluted share including charges of $0.39 per share
Raises 2012 EPS guidance to $4.20 to $4.70 per share
 
TEMPE, Ariz. - Aug. 1, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012. Net sales were $957 million in the quarter, an increase of $460 million from the first quarter of 2012 and $425 million from the second quarter of 2011.  The increases were primarily due to an increase in the number and size of projects under construction meeting revenue recognition criteria during the quarter, including Antelope Valley Solar Ranch 1 in California and Silver State North in Nevada.
 
The Company reported second quarter net income of $1.27 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.20 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 and net income of $0.70 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2011. The second quarter of 2012 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $36 million (reducing EPS by $0.39), relating to restructuring and certain costs in excess of normal warranty.
 
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the second quarter were $744 million, down from $750 million at the end of the first quarter of 2012.
Based on reductions in First Solars ongoing cost structure primarily related to our restructuring initiatives, the Company is increasing 2012 guidance as follows:
Despite market uncertainties, First Solar delivered strong performance in the quarter, said Jim Hughes, CEO. Looking forward, we are confident we have the right long-term strategy and the right platform to enable long-term growth and value creation. We believe that by executing our strategic roadmaps and completing our restructuring program we can achieve our targets of 2.6 to 3.0 GW of sales in sustainable markets, earning a return on invested capital of 13 to 17 percent by 2016.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), see the tables below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items:  Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense, and Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Companys operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Companys performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales, cost in excess of normal warranty expense reflects estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected long-term future costs.
 
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.

provided
that if the amount of the Agreed Currency so purchased is greater than the amount of the Agreed Currency due in respect of such liability immediately prior to such judgment or order, voluntary prepayment, realization of collateral, liquidation of a Loan Party or otherwise, then the Agents or the Lenders, as the case may be, agree to
return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing indemnity and agreement by each party shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from all other obligations contained in this Agreement and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action.
(c)
    
Amendments to Section 3 (Letters of Credit).
(i)
    
Section 3.1(a) is hereby amended to read:
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (

provided
that no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment then in effect, (ii) 105% of the Dollar Equivalent of the L/C Obligations attributable to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies would exceed the L/C Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect or (iii) the sum of (x) 105% of the Dollar Equivalent of Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (y) the Dollar Equivalent of the Revolving Extensions of Credit then outstanding other than Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies would exceed the Available Revolving Commitments. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euro or British Pound Sterling, as the case may be, or, if agreed by the applicable Issuing Lender, any Alternative Currency and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date,
provided
that any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods of up to one year (but in no event shall any such renewal extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above). The letters of credit identified on Schedule 3.1 (the 
Existing Letters of Credit
) shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued on the Closing Date for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(ii)
    
The fourth sentence of Section 3.2 is hereby amended to read:
A Letter of Credit shall be issued only if (and upon issuance of each Letter of Credit the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the L/C Commitment, (ii) the L/C Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the L/C Alternative Currency Sublimit and (iii) the amount of the Revolving Extensions of Credit shall not exceed the Total Revolving Commitments.
(iii)
    
Section 3.3(a) is hereby amended to read:
Each Borrower will pay a fee in Dollars on the Dollar Equivalent of all outstanding Letters of Credit (including Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies) issued for its account at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under the Revolving Loans, shared ratably among the Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, such Borrower shall pay to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee in Dollars in an amount agreed by the Company and such Issuing Lender on the undrawn and unexpired Dollar Equivalent amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.
(iv)
    
Section 3.4(a) is hereby amended by (A) adding the words in Dollars (other than with respect to amounts payable pursuant to Letters of Credit denominated in Euro, Canadian Dollars
or British Pound Sterling, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be payable in the respective currency in which such Letter of Credit is dominated)  after the phrase such L/C Participant shall pay and (B) adding the words of the Dollar Equivalent (other with respect to amounts payable pursuant to Letters of Credit denominated in Euro, Canadian Dollars or British Pound Sterling, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be payable in the respective currency in which such Letter of Credit is dominated) after the phrase such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage in the second sentence thereof.
(v)
    
Section 3.5 is hereby amended by (A) replacing the first sentence thereof with the following:
If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) the draft so paid in the currency in which such Letter of Credit was issued and (b) any Taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, not later than 2:00 P.M., Local Time, on (i) the Business Day such Borrower receives notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the next Business Day following the day that such Borrower receives notice of such draft. 
and (B) adding the following text at the end of such section:
If, as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Dollar and any Alternative Currency, the amount of the L/C Obligations exceeds 105% of the L/C Commitment, then Company shall, or cause the applicable Borrower to, deposit, within three Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent as cash collateral, an amount in Dollars equal to such excess. The obligation to deposit amounts shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount under the terms of a Letter of Credit. If (1) any Borrower was required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the L/C Obligations exceeding the L/C Commitment due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Euro, British Pound Sterling or any applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be, (2) the L/C Obligations no longer exceeds the L/C Commitment and (3) and the Borrower is not otherwise required to post cash collateral in respect of the Letters of Credit hereunder which has not been posted, then the amount of such excess shall be returned to such Borrower within five Business Days upon request of the Borrower.

Section 3.6 is hereby amended by replacing the second sentence thereof with the following:

(e)
    
Amendments to Section 4.18 (Accuracy of Information, etc.)
. The last sentence of Section 4.18 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding a (i) before the word contained and adding and (ii) delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.2(g) immediately after the word above.

EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net sales of $839 million
GAAP EPS of $1.00 per fully diluted share including restructuring charges of $0.27 per share
Non-GAAP EPS per fully diluted share of $1.27, excluding restructuring charges
Tightens 2012 EPS guidance range to $4.40 to $4.70, increasing guidance mid-point to $4.55
TEMPE, Ariz., Nov. 1, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012. Net sales were $839 million in the quarter, a decrease of $118 million from the second quarter of 2012 and $167 million from the third quarter of 2011.  The decrease in net sales from the second quarter of 2012 was primarily due to project-specific decreases including Silver State North, which was completed in the second quarter, and reduced construction activity at Agua Caliente, consistent with the Companys planned construction schedule. The decrease was partially offset by initial revenue recognition for the 550-megawatt
ac
Topaz Solar Farms project, which began construction in late 2011. 
The Company reported third quarter net income of $1.00 per fully diluted share, compared to net income of $1.27 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 and net income of $2.25 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. The third quarter of 2012 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $24.2 million (reducing EPS by $0.27), relating to previously announced restructuring actions.
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the third quarter were $717 million, down slightly from $744 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012.
The Company also updated its 2012 guidance as follows:
Despite continued uncertainties and over-supply conditions in the market, First Solar delivered another strong quarterly performance, said Jim Hughes, CEO. Our quarterly performance coupled with our recent project wins in sustainable markets demonstrates we are making meaningful progress in achieving our strategic plan for long-term growth and value creation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items: Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Companys operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Companys performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
 
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.

TEMPE, Ariz., Feb, 26, 2013

$1.1 billion
in the quarter, an increase of
$236 million
from the third quarter of 2012 and
$415 million
from the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in net sales from the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to increased revenue recognition for the Topaz project, and an increase in third-party module sales. Net sales for 2012 were
$3.4 billion
, up
22%
from 2011.
The Company reported fourth quarter GAAP net income per fully diluted share of
$1.74

), relating to previously announced restructuring actions. The Company reported a full-year GAAP loss of
$1.11
per share for 2012, including the impact of pre-tax charges of $529 million (reducing EPS by $5.99), relating to previously announced restructuring actions and costs in excess of normal warranty. Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share was
$2.04
for the fourth quarter and

The Company also provided guidance for the first quarter of 2013 as follows:
Despite a very challenging market environment, we continued to make meaningful progress in all critical value drivers for the Company, said Jim Hughes, CEO of First Solar. We exceeded our module and balance-of-systems cost reduction targets for 2012, as announced in December 2011, further increased module efficiency and field performance, and achieved several key objectives in our strategy to develop and service new sustainable energy markets. We expect the market will remain turbulent for some time to come, but we have seen some evidence of improvement and believe we have the right strategy in place to retain our industry leadership by providing the best value for our customers.
First Solar achieved several milestones over the past year:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items: Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense and Restructuring. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Companys operating performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Companys performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
Costs in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expense, costs in excess of normal warranty expense reflect estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected long-term future costs.
 
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.

) Amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP adjustments on non-GAAP net income. 
(2) Amount is calculated based upon Net income divided by Weighted-average shares outstanding. The sum of Net income per fully diluted share across the table may not equal the calculated amount due to rounding.

(1) Balance includes $469.1 million of restructuring expense and $4.7 million of costs associated with the repayment of debt for our German manufacturing center.
(2) Balance includes (i) $35.1 million related to estimated expenses associated with certain remediation efforts related to the manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. The remaining increase was primarily related to a change in estimate for the market value of the modules that we estimate will be returned to us under the voluntary remediation efforts that meet the required performance standards to be re-sold as refurbished modules, (ii) $15.9 million in estimated compensation payments to customers, under certain circumstances, for power lost prior to remediation of the customers system under our remediation program, and (iii) $4.4 million in estimated expenses for remediation efforts related to module removal, replacement and logistical services committed to and undertaken by us beyond the normal product warranty.
(3) Amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of non-GAAP adjustments on non-GAAP net income.
(4) Amount is calculated based upon Net (loss) income divided by Weighted-average shares outstanding. The sum of Net (loss) income per fully diluted share across the table may not equal the calculated amount due to rounding and differences in the Weighted-average shares outstanding.

Summary outlook through 2015
 
TEMPE, Ariz., April 9, 2013 -
First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced full-year 2013 guidance as well as summary financial targets through 2015.
For 2013, First Solar expects total module shipments to be between 1.6GW and 1.8GW and net sales of $3.8 and $4.0 billion, including approximately $3.6 billion in net sales from systems sales. Consolidated gross margin is expected to be between 20 and 22 percent. Excluding up to $10 million in restructuring expense as previously announced, diluted EPS is expected to be between $4.00 and $4.50, and consolidated operating income is expected to be between $430 and $460 million. The Company expects to generate $0.8 to $1.0 billion of operating cash flow and plans for approximately $350 to $400 million in capital expenditures in 2013. Working capital is expected to decrease by between $50 and $200 million from 2012. The Company noted that revenue recognition for the Desert Sunlight project is currently expected to begin in the second half of 2013 and conclude by late 2014. This assumption is reflected in the Companys 2013 guidance and 2014 outlook.
In addition to the 2013 detailed guidance, the Company also provided a summary outlook for 2014 and 2015 as follows:
First Solars Chief Financial Officer, Mark Widmar provided the guidance and outlook during its 2013 Analyst Day event held today in New York.

EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2013 Financial Results
Net sales of $755 million
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per fully diluted share
GAAP EPS of $0.66 per fully diluted share
Cash and Marketable Securities of $1 billion    
Maintains full-year 2013 guidance
TEMPE, Ariz., May 6, 2013
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Net sales were $755 million in the quarter, a decrease of $320 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 and an increase of $258 million from the first quarter of 2012.  The decrease in net sales from the fourth quarter of 2012 was primarily due to less revenue recognition from our systems business projects primarily related to the Topaz project, while the increase over the first quarter of 2012 was primarily due to higher sales volumes for third-party module sales and an increase in revenue from systems projects.
The Company reported first quarter net income per fully diluted share of $0.66, compared to $1.74 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and a loss of $5.20 in the first quarter of 2012, which included $444 million in pre-tax restructuring charges and costs in excess of normal warranty. The first quarter of 2013 was impacted by pre-tax restructuring charges of $2 million (reducing EPS by $0.03), compared to $25 million (reducing EPS by $0.30) in the fourth quarter of 2012. In both cases the pre-tax charges related to previously announced restructuring actions. The sequential decrease in earnings was primarily due to higher revenue recognition for Topaz in the fourth quarter of 2012, temporary construction delays at the AVSR project, and previously planned lower manufacturing utilization as the Company accelerated efforts to upgrade production lines, which is expected to enable the Company to achieve near term targets on its module cost and efficiency improvement roadmaps.
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the first quarter were approximately $1 billion, essentially unchanged compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, and an increase of $262 million over the first quarter of 2012. Cash flows from operations were $66 million in the first quarter, compared to $328 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.
The Company also maintained its full year 2013 financial guidance as issued during the 2013 Analyst Day event held April 9, 2013. Copies of the presentation materials for both the Analyst Day event and the first quarter 2013 earnings call are posted in the Investor section of its website at
www.firstsolar.com
.
We demonstrated progress on several fronts during the first quarter, including continued strengthening of our balance sheet and additions to our pipeline, said Jim Hughes, CEO of First Solar. We remain on track for the year and reaffirm our full-year 2013 financial guidance and are focused on achieving our goal of new bookings to shipments ratio of one-to-one.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), see the tables below.
First Solar has scheduled a conference call for today, May 6, 2013 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss this announcement. Investors may access a live webcast of this conference call by visiting

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for Restructuring Expense. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
Restructuring
: Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our Long Term Strategic Plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.
(
1
) Amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP adjustments on non-GAAP net income. 
(2) Amount is calculated based upon Net income divided by Weighted-average shares outstanding. The sum of Net income per fully diluted share across the table may not equal the calculated amount due to rounding.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On April 9, 2013, we provided our guidance for 2013, including a range for 2013 net sales of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion and a range for 2013 earnings per share of $4.00 to $4.50. Today, we are reaffirming our 2013 guidance, including our estimated net sales range and our estimated earnings per share range.
We have not historically provided guidance regarding financial performance during any particular quarter, with the exception of the first quarter of 2013. As we stated on our first quarter of 2013 earnings call, the sale of certain projects in Canada, which we refer to as the ABW projects, could close in the second half of 2013 rather than in the second quarter of 2013. This would result in a shift of the net sales and earnings associated with the sale of these projects from the second quarter of 2013 into the second half of 2013. Although we are currently working on closing the sale of these projects in the second quarter, we expect that any such shift would result in a material sequential decline in our net sales and a material sequential decline in earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013 and a corresponding increase in our net sales and earnings per share for the second half of 2013. This kind of quarterly variability is the principal reason that we have not historically provided guidance on a quarterly basis, and we reiterate that it is important to stay focused on our full year guidance, which we are reaffirming today.
