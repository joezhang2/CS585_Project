Exhibit 99.1 NVIDIA Announces Conclusion of SEC Investigation SANTA CLARA, CA - SEPTEMBER 11, 2003 - NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA), the worldwide leader in visual processing solutions, today announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has concluded its investigation of NVIDIA. The SEC and NVIDIA have reached a final agreement resolving an investigation undertaken by the SEC's staff. That investigation was disclosed by NVIDIA in February 2002. As announced by NVIDIA earlier this year, NVIDIA and the SEC staff had reached an agreement in principle to end the investigation, subject to review and approval by the SEC. Under the final agreement NVIDIA, while neither admitting nor denying any wrongdoing, agreed to entry of an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain non-fraud financial reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. The order has no impact on NVIDIA's reported financial results, and no penalty or fine has been assessed against the Company. This order arose out of an inquiry by the SEC regarding certain accounting matters. That inquiry was announced by NVIDIA on February 14, 2002. In accordance with the suggestion and advice of the SEC staff, NVIDIA at that time launched an internal review of the accounting matters. On April 29, 2002, the Company announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors had, with assistance from outside legal counsel and outside forensic auditors, concluded its review and determined that it was appropriate to restate NVIDIA's financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.

Item 4.
   
Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
(a) Previous independent accountants
 
(i) 
In March 2004, NVIDIA Corporation's ("the Registrant") Audit Committee commenced a process to request and consider proposals from its current auditors KPMG LLP ("KPMG") and each of the three other largest independent auditing firms to serve as independent accountants for the Registrant. On April 19, 2004, the Audit Committee decided to dismiss KPMG as the Registrant's independent accountants effective April 20, 2004. The Audit Committee has authorized, effective April 22, 2004, the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as its independent accountants to audit the Registrant's financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 30, 2005.
 
(ii) 
KPMG's reports on the Registrant's consolidated financial statements during the two-year period ended January 25, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles except as follows:
 
KPMG's report on the consolidated financial statements of NVIDIA Corporation and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended January 25, 2004 and January 26, 2003 contained a separate paragraph stating "As discussed in Note 1 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, effective January 28, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
"
 
(iii) 
Authorization of the change in the Registrant's independent accountants from KPMG to PwC was made by the Audit Committee of the Registrant's Board of Directors
 
(iv) 
During the Registrant's two most recently completed fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period preceding KPMG's dismissal, there were no disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.
 
(v) 
During the Registrant's two most recently completed fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period preceding KPMG's dismissal, there were no "reportable events" (hereinafter defined) requiring disclosure pursuant to Section 229.304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The term "reportable event" means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Section 304 of Regulation S-K.
 
(b) New independent accountants
 
As indicated above, on April 22, 2004, the Registrant engaged PwC as its independent accountants. During the Registrant's two most recently completed fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period preceding the decision not to renew KPMG, neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf consulted PwC regarding either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant's consolidated financial statements, nor has PwC provided to the Registrant a written report or oral advice regarding such principles or audit opinion.
 
(c) Letter from previous independent accountants
 
The Registrant requested KPMG to furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of that letter from KPMG dated April 23, 2004 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

E XHIBIT 99.1
 NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended July 25, 2004.
SANTA CLARA, CA.  August 5, 2004
For the second quarter of
fiscal 2005
, revenue was $456.1 million, compared to $459.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.  Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $5.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $24.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
Revenue for the six months ended July 25, 2004 was $928.0 million, compared to revenue of $864.8 million for the six months ended July 27, 2003.

"Q2 was challenging and disappointing as the desktop GPU segment declined significantly as a result of several unusual market events," stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. "A major highlight, however, was shipping significant volumes of our GeForce 6800, the industry's first Shader Model 3.0 GPU. We have once again taken the technology lead with GeForce 6 and are aggressively driving it deeper into the mainstream and value desktop, notebook and professional business segments. Our bold strategy to bring a fundamentally new architecture to the PCI Express transition has resulted in winning key design wins in each segment."

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, CAFEBRUARY 1, 2005
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA), a worldwide leader in graphics and digital media processors, today announced preliminary financial results for the quarter ended January 30, 2005. The Company expects to report total revenue for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 between $560 million to $570 million, as compared to the previous guidance of $516 million to slightly higher. Fourth quarter gross margin percentage is expected to be between 33.5 percent and 34.5 percent, as compared to the previous guidance of 33.3 percent.
During the fourth quarter, the Company introduced the new GeForce 6200 graphics processing unit (GPU) with TurboCache technology, the industry's only Shader Model 3.0 GPU designed for the value segment. The addition of the GeForce 6200 GPU continued to drive momentum for the entire GeForce 6 GPU family, leading to share gains and strong revenue growth in the core GPU segments, offsetting an anticipated seasonal revenue decline of approximately $70 million from the third fiscal quarter of 2005 of Xbox products. The growing adoption of the Company's NVIDIA nForce 4 media and communications processors (MCPs) and the continued ramp of the GoForce wireless media processor (WMP) design wins produced record revenue for each business unit. Driven by a continued product mix shift to the GeForce 6 GPU family and an increased mix shift to NVIDIA nForce 4 MCPs, gross margin percentage continues to improve ahead of Company expectations.
NVIDIA will host a conference call to discuss its final financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2005 and the outlook for its first quarter on February 17, 2005 at 2:00 PM, Pacific Time. The Company's prepared remarks will be followed by a question and answer period, which will be limited to questions from analysts and institutional investors.

On February 7, 2005 and February 11, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) authorized the cash payment of variable compensation awards in respect of its fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 (Fiscal Year 2005). Cash awards for the named executive officers were based on metrics established by the Compensation Committee in February 2004. The amount of variable compensation awards was based one half on individual performance through the achievement of previously established key objectives and the other half was based on corporate performance through the achievement of revenue and gross margin targets. The Compensation Committee did not award variable compensation awards based on corporate performance as the Company did not achieve the previously established revenue and gross margin targets for Fiscal Year 2005. The following table sets forth the cash bonuses to be paid to the named executive officers as a result of their individual performance during Fiscal Year 2005:
The Company will pay the variable performance awards during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2006.

Further, even if a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of his or her Individual Variable Cash Payment.

Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents
 
  The corporation shall indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XII, executive officers shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law; that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive officers.
(a)
Directors and Executive Officers
.
provided, however,
 
   The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person (other than as specified in clause (a) above) to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
(b)
Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents
.
 
   The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or executiveofficer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding; , that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or an executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or an executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise.
(c)
Expenses
.
 
provided, however
 
19
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 46, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
 
   Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executiveofficer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.Neither the failure of the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of any undertaking, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
(d)
Enforcement
.
 
 
 
20
   The rights conferred on any person by this Section 46 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.
(e)
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
.
 
   The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

.
 
   Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 46 that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
(h)
Amendments
.
 
   If this Section 46 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Section 46 that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section 46 shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, CA
MARCH 6, 2006
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. NVIDIA also announced that its Board has approved an increase in the Companys existing share repurchase program.
Stock Split
The stock split will entitle each stockholder of record at the close of business on Friday, March 17, 2006 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the stock split are expected to be distributed by the transfer agent on or about Thursday, April 6, 2006. Upon the completion of the stock split, NVIDIA will have approximately 360 million shares of common stock outstanding.
Stock Repurchase Program
The Company also announced a $400,000,000 increase to the original stock repurchase program it announced in August 2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700,000,000, of which the Company has purchased approximately $263,000,000.
The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at the Companys discretion. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. As of January 29, 2006, NVIDIA had over $950,000,000 of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

SECTION 1 - Registrants Business and Operations
 
Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(a)
 
On March 7, 2006, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved an amendment to our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Plan. The amendments to the Plan:
The foregoing summary of changes contained in the Plan is qualified in its entirety by the Plan itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The amendments to the Plan did not require stockholder approval and were effective upon approval by our Compensation Committee.
(b)
 
On March 7, 2006,
the Compensation Committee approved cash bonus awards earned during fiscal 2006 by our executive officers under our Fiscal Year 2006 Variable Compensation Plan Management Bonus Plan. The bonus awards are based upon the achievement of performance goals, which were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee in May 2005. The bonus awards will be paid in fiscal 2007.
SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On March 9, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to Article IV, Section 15 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or the Amendment, to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance or other committee designated by the Board of Directors will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board of Director's decision. If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board of Directors, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board of Directors.
The foregoing summary of changes contained in the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the Amendment itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.4 and is incorporated herein by reference.
SECTION 9 - Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

This subsection shall not apply prior to the Listing Date and, following the Listing Date, this subsection shall not apply until (i) the earliest of: (A) the first material modification of the Plan (including any increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan in accordance with Section 4); (B) the issuance of all of the shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan; (C) the expiration of the Plan; or (D) the first meeting of stockholders at which Directors of the Company are to be elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which occurred the first registration of an equity security under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; or (ii) such other date required by Section 162(m) of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
(d)
  
At any such time or times that the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan are insufficient for the purpose of making one or more of the non-discretionary grants of options specified in Section 5 of the Directors Plan, then, without any further action of the Board, the number of shares of Common Stock remaining in the share reserve of the Directors Plan shall be applied to such non-discretionary grants on a pro rated basis, and any additional number of shares of Common Stock required for such non-discretionary grants of options shall be deemed to have been made under this Plan but on the terms and conditions specified in the Directors Plan. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of the Directors Plan and this Plan, the terms and conditions of the Directors Plan shall control. Notwithstanding anything in the Directors Plan or this Plan to the contrary, the terms and conditions of the Directors Plan shall survive the termination of the Directors Plan as to any non-discretionary grants of options made pursuant to this subsection 5(d).
 
6.
  
Option Provisions.
 
Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a)
  
Term.
No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date it was granted.
 
(b)
  
Price.
The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. The exercise price of each Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted.
 
7
(c)
  
Consideration.
The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised, or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of the grant of the Option, (a) by delivery to the Company of other Common Stock, (b) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other Common Stock) with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to subsection 6(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board. In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be compounded at least annually and shall be charged at the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid (i) the imputation of interest income to the holder of the Option under any applicable provisions of the Code, and (ii) the classification of the Option as a liability for financial accounting purposes.
 
(d)
  
Transferability.
An Incentive Stock Option and, prior to the Listing Date, a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Incentive Stock Option is granted only by such person. After the Listing Date, a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be transferable to the extent provided in the Option Agreement. If the Nonstatutory Stock Option does not provide for transferability, then the Nonstatutory Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Option is granted only by such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of subsection 6(d), the person to whom the Option is granted may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionee, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option.
 
(e)
  
Vesting.
The total number of shares of stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). The Option Agreement may provide that from time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option became vested but was not fully exercised. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised which may be based upon performance or other criteria as the Board may deem appropriate. The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f)
  
Minimum Vesting Prior To The Listing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection, Options granted prior to the Listing Date shall provide for vesting of the total number of shares at a rate of at least twenty percent (20%) per year over five (5) years from the date the Option was granted, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment. However, in the case of such Options granted to officers, directors or consultants (within the meaning of Section 260.140.41 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations), the Option may become fully exercisable, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment, at any time or during any period established by the Company; for example, the vesting provision of the Option may provide for vesting of less than twenty percent (20%) per year of the total number of shares subject to the Option.
 
8
(g)
  
Termination Of Continuous Service.
In the event an Optionee's Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability), the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement, which, for Options granted prior to the Listing Date, shall not be less than thirty (30) days unless such termination is for cause), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
 
(h)
  
Disability Of Optionee.
In the event an Optionee's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionee's disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option, (to the extent such Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement, which, for Options granted prior to the Listing Date, shall not be less than six (6) months) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
 
(i)
  
Death Of Optionee.
In the event of the death of an Optionee during, or within a period specified in the Option after the termination of, the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant, the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death) by the Optionee's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionee's death pursuant to subsection 6(d), but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement, which, for Options granted prior to the Listing Date, shall not be less than six (6) months), or (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the time of death, the Optionee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
 
9
(j)
  
Early Exercise.
The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionee may elect at any time before the Optionee's Continuous Service terminates to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Subject to the repurchase option limitations specified in subsection 11(h), any unvested shares so purchased may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate.

(iii)
 
Calculation of Appreciation
. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of share of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such Stock Appreciation Right, and with respect to which the Participant is exercising the Stock Appreciation Right on such date, over (ii) the strike price that is determined by the Board at the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right.

Neither an Employee, Director or Consultant nor any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred under subsection 6(d) or 7(a)(ii) shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms.

The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock.

(ii)
  
If repurchase option gives the Company the right to repurchase the shares upon termination of employment at the original purchase price, then (1) the right to repurchase at the original purchase price shall lapse at the rate of at least twenty percent (20%) of the shares per year over five (5) years from the date the Stock Award is granted (without respect to the date the Stock Award was exercised or became exercisable) and (2) the right to repurchase shall be exercised for cash or cancellation of purchase money indebtedness for the shares within ninety (90) days of termination of employment (or in the case of shares issued upon exercise of Options after the date of termination, within ninety (90) days after the date of the exercise) or such longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the Participant (for example, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 1202(c)(3) of the Code regarding "qualified small business stock").

(c)
  
In the event of (1) a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise, then any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation shall assume any or all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar stock awards (including an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders in the transaction described in this subsection) for those outstanding under the Plan. A surviving corporation or acquiring corporation may choose to (i) assume or substitute outstanding Stock Awards on a grant-by-grant basis, and (ii) assume or substitute only a portion of a Stock Award or substitute a similar stock award for only a portion of a Stock Award. In the event any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation refuses to assume any or all outstanding Stock Awards or to substitute similar stock awards for those outstanding under the Plan, then with respect to Stock Awards not assumed or substituted and held by persons whose Continuous Service has not terminated, the vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised) shall be accelerated upon prior written notice by the Company to the holders of such Stock Awards at least five (5) business days prior to such event and the Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to such event. With respect to any other Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan, upon advance written notice by the Company of at least five (5) business days to the holders of such Stock Awards, such Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to such event.

No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.
 
(b)
  
Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be altered or impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.
 
15.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(a)   On March 29, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) approved the Fiscal Year 2007 Variable Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan) which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to the Companys chief executive officer, senior officers, vice presidents, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors (the Participants), as determined by the Compensation Committee, if certain pre-set corporate and individual targets are achieved during the year.
Under the 2007 Plan, variable cash compensation will be paid to the Participants if the Company achieves pre-set Company targets based on the Company's net income objectives as set by the Compensation Committee and/or if individuals achieve their individual targets which are determined by the Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer for the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice presdient or a director reports, and based on individual rankings for the managers and the other qualifying senior contributors.  Fifty percent (50%) of a Participant's potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achievement of corporate targets and fifty percent (50%) will be allocated to the achievement of individual targets.
Variable compensation resulting from achievement of the corporate targets is determined by the Compensation Committee. The achievement of individual targets is determined by the Compensation Committee in the case of the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and by the senior officer or director to whom a manager or senior contributor reports in the case of managers and senior contributors.
 
The Company's Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reserve the right to modify these targets and criteria at any time or to grant additional variable cash compensation to the Participants even if the performance targets are not met.
 
The 2007 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the 2007 Plan.
(b)   On March 28, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment and restatement of the Companys 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). The amendments to the Plan:
Share amounts above reflect the 2-for-1 stock split recently announced by the Company. The foregoing summary of changes contained in the Plan is qualified in its entirety by the Plan itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The amendments to the Plan did not require stockholder approval and were effective upon approval by the Companys Board of Directors.

(iii)
  Payment pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company either prior to the issuance of shares of the Companys common stock or pursuant to the terms of irrevocable instructions issued by the optionee prior to the issuance of shares of the Companys common stock.
 
(iv)
  Payment by a combination of the methods of payment specified in subparagraph 6(c)(i) through 6(c)(iii) above.
 
(d)  
An option shall be transferable only to the extent specifically provided in the option agreement;
provided, however,
that if the option agreement does not specifically provide for the transferability of an option, then the option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the option is granted only by such person (or by his guardian or legal representative) or transferee pursuant to such an order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the optionee may, by delivering written notice to the Company in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the optionee, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the option.
 
(e)  
The options granted pursuant to Section 5 shall vest and become exercisable as follows:
 
(i)
  The Initial Grant shall vest quarterly over the three (3)-year period following the date of grant such that the entire Initial Grant shall become exercisable on the three (3)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option, provided that the optionee has, during the entire period prior to each such vesting installment date, continuously served as a director or employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, whereupon such option shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with its terms with respect to that portion of the shares represented by that installment.
  
(ii)
  With respect to an Annual Grant, if the optionee has attended at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the meetings of the Board held between the date of grant of the option and the two (2)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option, then the Annual Grant shall begin vesting quarterly in equal installments on the two (2)-year anniversary of the date of grant such that entire Annual Grant shall become vested and exercisable on the three (3)-year anniversary of the date of the grant of the option. If the optionees service as a Director terminates between the date of grant of the option and the two (2)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option due to the disability or death of the optionee, then the Annual Grant shall immediately vest and become exercisable on a quarterly pro rata basis. Unless the Annual Grant sooner vests and becomes exercisable as provided in this subsection 6(e)(ii), the Annual Grant shall vest over the four (4)-year period following the date of grant at the rate of thirty percent (30%) on the three (3)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option and seventy percent (70%) on the four (4)-year anniversary such that the entire Annual Grant shall become vested and exercisable on the four (4)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option, provided that the optionee has, during the entire period prior to each such vesting installment date, continuously served as a director or employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate
of the Company, whereupon such option shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with its terms with respect to that portion of the shares represented by that installment.
 
(iii)
  With respect to each Committee Grant, if the optionee has attended at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the meetings of the committee held between the date of grant of the option and the one (1)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option, then the Committee Grant shall vest and become exercisable in full on the one (1)-year anniversary of the date of grant. If the optionees service as a committee member terminates between the date of grant of the option and the one (1)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option due to the disability or death of the optionee, then the Committee Grant shall immediately vest and become exercisable on a monthly pro rata basis for each month served on the respective committee. Unless the Committee Grant sooner vests and becomes exercisable as provided in this subsection 6(e)(iii), the Committee Grant shall vest annually over the four (4)-year period following the date of grant at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year for the first three (3) years and seventy percent (70%) for the fourth (4th) year such that the entire Committee Grant shall become exercisable on the four (4)-year anniversary of the date of grant of the option, provided that the optionee has, during the entire period prior to each such vesting installment date, continuously served as a director or employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, whereupon such option shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with its terms with respect to that portion of the shares represented by that installment.
 
(f)  
The Company may require any optionee, or any person to whom an option is transferred under subparagraph 6(d), as a condition of exercising any such option: (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the optionees knowledge and experience in financial and business matters; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the stock subject to the option for such persons own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. These requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of the option has been registered under a then currently-effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or (ii) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may require any optionee to provide such other representations, written assurances or information that the Company shall determine is necessary, desirable or appropriate to comply with applicable securities laws as a condition of granting an option to the optionee or permitting the optionee to exercise the option. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock.
 
(g)  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an option may not be exercised unless the shares issuable upon exercise of such option are then registered under the Securities Act or, if such shares are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
 
7.    COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
 
(a)  
During the terms of the options granted under the Plan, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of stock required to satisfy such options.
 
(b)  
The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of stock upon exercise of the options granted under the Plan;
provided however,
that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act either the Plan, any option granted under the Plan, or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such option. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such options.
 
8.    USE OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK.
 
Proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to options granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company.
 
9.    MISCELLANEOUS.
 
(a)  
Neither an optionee nor any person to whom an option is transferred under subparagraph 6(d) shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such option unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the option pursuant to its terms.
 
(b)  
Nothing in the Plan or in any instrument executed pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Non-Employee Director any right to continue in the service of the Company or any Affiliate in any capacity or shall affect any right of the Company, its Board or stockholders or any Affiliate, to remove any Non-Employee Director pursuant to the Companys Bylaws and the provisions of Delaware general corporation law.
 
(c)  
In connection with each option made pursuant to the Plan, it shall be a condition precedent to the Companys obligation to issue or transfer shares to a Non-Employee Director, or to evidence the removal of any restrictions on transfer, that such Non-Employee Director make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to insure that the amount of any federal, state or local withholding tax required to be withheld with respect to such sale or transfer, or such removal or lapse, is made available to the Company for timely payment of such tax.
 
(d)  
As used in this Plan, Fair Market Value means, as of any date, the value of the common stock of the Company determined as follows:
 
(i)
  If the common stock is listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system, including without limitation the NASDAQ National Market (NASDAQ) or The NASDAQ SmallCap, the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock shall be the closing sales price for such stock (or the closing bid, if no sales were reported) as quoted on such system or exchange (or the exchange with the greatest volume of trading in common stock) on the last market trading day prior to the day of determination, as reported in the Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Board deems reliable; or
 
(ii)
  In the absence of an established market for the common stock, the Fair Market Value shall be determined in good faith by the Board.
 
10.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN STOCK.
 
(a)  
If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any option granted under the Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan and outstanding options will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the Plan and the class(es) and number of shares and price per share of stock subject to outstanding options. Such adjustments shall be made by the Board, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company.)
 
(b)  
In the event of: (1) a dissolution, liquidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation; (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of the Companys common stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise; or (4) the acquisition by any person, entity or group within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) or any comparable successor provisions (excluding any employee benefit plan, or related trust, sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) of the beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or comparable successor rule) of securities of the Company representing at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, then to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, (i) any surviving or acquiring corporation shall assume any options outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar options (including an option to acquire the same consideration paid to the shareholders in the transaction described in this subparagraph 10(b)) for those outstanding under the Plan, or (ii) such options shall continue in full force and effect. In the event any surviving or acquiring corporation refuses to assume such options, or to substitute similar options for those outstanding under the Plan, then such options shall be terminated if not exercised prior to such event.
 
11.    AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN.
 
(a)  
The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan and/or some or all outstanding options granted under the Plan. However, except as provided in paragraph 10 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company to the extent stockholder approval is necessary for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any NASDAQ or securities exchange listing requirements.
 
(b)  
Rights and obligations under any option granted before any amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the option was granted and (ii) such person consents in writing.

(b)  
Suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair rights and obligations under any option granted while the Plan is in effect, except with the consent of the person to whom the option was granted.
 
13.    EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN; CONDITIONS OF EXERCISE.
 
(a)  
The Plan shall become effective on the same day that the Companys initial public offering of shares of common stock becomes effective, subject to the condition subsequent that the stockholders of the Company approve the Plan.

Exhibit 10.2
 
Overview
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the 
Company
) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Senior Officers, Directors and Managers as defined below (collectively, the Participants), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2007 and are employees of the Company on and as of January 28, 2007, shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2007 Variable Compensation Plan (the 
Plan
). The Plan is designed to award a cash payment (each a 
Variable Cash Payment
) for performance in fiscal year 2007 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets (
Corporate Targets
) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below) and/or certain Individual Rankings (as defined below).
For purposes of the Plan, the Companys chief executive officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered 
Senior Officers,
 other employees at the level of vice president or director shall be considered 
Directors
 and managers or qualifying senior contributors shall be considered 
Managers
. The Compensation Committee (the 
Committee
) shall determine (i) the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan, (ii) the class of employees who may be designated by Senior Officers as Directors for purposes of this Plan and (iii) the class of employees who many be designated by Senior Officers or Directors as Managers for purposes of this Plan.
For fiscal year 2007, for purposes of the Plan, 
Individual Targets
 shall be set for Senior Officers and Directors as follows:
For fiscal year 2007, for purposes of the Plan, 
Individual Rankings
 for Managers shall be the ranking of such Manager in January or February 2007 by the Senior Officer or Director to whom the Manager reports.
Determination of Fiscal Year 2007 Variable Cash Payments
Senior Officers and Directors are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or the Senior Officer or Director achieves their Individual Targets at specified levels. Managers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or based on the level of their Individual Ranking. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of the Corporate Targets and/or his or her Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based
 
on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (the 
Variable Cash Payment Target Amount
). A Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2007, each Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the 
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, (the 
Individual Variable Cash Payment
). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Variable Cash Payment Target Amount as described more fully below.
Individual Variable Cash Payment
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, or other criteria determined by the Committee.
The actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2007 (the 
Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved or the level of the Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the amount of the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment shall be determined as follows:
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, or in the case of a Manager who does not reach his or her Individual Ranking, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), Senior Officers (for other Directors) or Senior Officers or Directors (for Managers who report to such Senior Officer or Director, as applicable), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants, based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2007 net income. The amount of actual net income, as set forth in the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2007, but (i) excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) excluding or including items that the Committee in its sole discretion deems to be extraordinary or otherwise inappropriate to include or appropriate to include,
 
shall be the 
Actual Result
. The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2007 for Participants, for the award of all of or a portion of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the 
Threshold
 and 
Maximum
). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2007 (the 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines:
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment =
   (Actual Result - Threshold)  
x Corporate Variable Cash Payment
(Corporate Target - Threshold)
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment = [(
Actual Result - Corporate Target
) +1] x Corporate Variable
 
Cash Payment
      (Maximum - Corporate Target)
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Payment.
If a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
Miscellaneous Provisions
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Companys employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
The Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Corporate Targets, Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking and/or Corporate and/or Individual Variable Cash Payment amounts at any time.
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 includes stock-based compensation expense of $23.0 million as a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), during the quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2007, which excludes SFAS 123R stock-based compensation and related tax differences, was $111.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share.
All share numbers and per share amounts set forth in this release and the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Companys two-for-one stock split effected April 6, 2006 through the payment of stock dividends to the holders of record on March 17, 2006.
 
We experienced growth in each of our businesses - GPU, MCP, handheld GPU, and consumer electronics - resulting in record revenue for the first quarter, stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. We also entered multiple new product cycles during the quarter, continuing our leadership in each of the markets we serve. As we move further into the new fiscal year, the growth drivers we outlined at our Analyst Day in March, which include the adoption of Microsoft Vista, high-definition video, and the launch of the Sony PlayStation3, will continue to accelerate and give us the opportunity for another strong year of growth.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share, and other non-GAAP line items from the Consolidated Statements of Income, including cost of revenue information, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses (including research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses) and income tax expense. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods that did not include SFAS 123R, we have shown a non-GAAP presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Income as reconciled against the GAAP presentation. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude SFAS 123R stock-based compensation and related tax differences. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP results enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SECTION 4 - Matters Related to Accountants and Financial Statements
Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
On November 1, 2006, NVIDIA Corporation, ("NVIDIA" or the "Company") announced that it expects to restate its previously-issued financial statements for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006, together with selected financial statements for earlier years, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 that ended April 30, 2006 to correct errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation expense.
The Company currently estimates that the restatement will not have a material impact on the Company's operating results for any period in the current fiscal year 2007 and that the net impact of the restatement will be aggregate non-cash charges of less than $150 million for stock-based compensation expense, net of related tax effects.
The Company is in the process of finalizing the impact of the errors and evaluating the impact of this matter on its internal control over financial reporting.
As previously announced, in June 2006 the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA began a review of the Company's stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee's review covered the time from the Company's initial public offering in 1999 to the current fiscal year and, as previously disclosed, found instances of the use of incorrect measurement dates for certain option grants. The Audit Committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts.
At this time, the Audit Committee has completed its forensic review of the option grants and is now working with the Company's management to finalize the financial impact of using incorrect measurement dates. As a result of its investigation, the Audit Committee has concluded that there are no concerns with respect to the integrity of current management.
The Audit Committee has reached a preliminary conclusion, based upon the recommendation of management, that NVIDIA will need to restate its historical financial statements to record additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to stock option grants as a result of errors in recording the measurement date for certain stock option grants. Accordingly, the Company advises that all of the Company's financial statements and related communications for periods commencing on or after January 31, 1999 should not be relied upon, including any reports of KPMG LLP, the Company's former independent registered public accounting firm and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's current independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a) with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP.
The stock-based compensation charges incurred will have the effect of decreasing reported net income or increasing reported loss from operations and decreasing the reported retained earnings figures contained in the Company's historical financial statements for the periods noted above. The Company does not expect that the anticipated restatements will have any impact on its historical revenues or cash position for any period. The Company's auditors have not completed their review of the findings of the investigation.
NVIDIA intends to file its restated financial statements and its delinquent quarterly report for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 that ended July 30, 2006 as soon as practicable.

"The third quarter was one of the best in NVIDIA's history", said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. "For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered record revenue as we continued to gain share in each of our core businesses."
"This week, we made two announcements that set the foundation for continued strong growth in the coming year and beyond. First, we announced the GeForce 8800 and nForce 680i, which represent the most ambitious undertaking in the history of the company. The GeForce 8800 is the world's first DX10 unified shader GPU. The nForce 680i is the highest performance motherboard supporting Intel's exciting Core 2 Duo processors. The combination of GeForce 8800 and nForce 680i delivers what we believe are the perfect technologies to support the biggest confluence of technology changes to hit our industry in the last 10 years  Windows Vista, DX10 and Blu-ray/HD. Second, we announced the acquisition of PortalPlayer. By combining our GPU technology with PortalPlayer's application processor expertise, we intend to be a major player in the mobile industry by delivering the two most essential technologies for next generation handheld devices," Huang said.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 and Recent Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As previously announced, in June 2006 the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA began a review of the Company's stock option practices based on results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee's review covered the time from the Company's initial public offering in 1999 to the current fiscal year and as previously disclosed, found instances of the use of incorrect measurement dates for certain option grants. The Audit Committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts. At this time, the Audit Committee has completed its forensic review of the option grants and is now working with the Company's management to finalize the financial impact of using incorrect measurement dates. NVIDIA will publish the balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter and the statement of income for the nine months ended October 29, 2006, as well as restated statements of income for the comparable periods of fiscal 2006 as soon as practical upon completion of the Audit Committee's review.
The Company's current and former independent registered public accounting firms have not completed their review of the findings of the Audit Committee. Our financial results for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2007 are not audited and may change as a result of the ongoing Audit Committee review. The stock option practices under review and related matters could also lead to potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including litigation or action by the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other regulatory agencies.
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2007 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time (5:00 P.M. Eastern
Time). To listen to the call, please dial (706) 679-0543. A live Web cast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be held at the NVIDIA investor relations Web site and at . The Web cast will be recorded and available for replay until the Company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter fiscal 2007.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share, and other non-GAAP line items from the Consolidated Statements of Income, including cost of revenue information, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses (including research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses) and income tax expense. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a non-GAAP presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Income as reconciled against the GAAP presentation. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring charges associated with settling IP matters and related tax differences. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP results enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The Company shall give Parent: (a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to any stockholder's appraisal rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA), the worldwide leader in programmable graphics technologies, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire San Jose, CA-based PortalPlayer, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLAY), a leading supplier of semiconductors, firmware, and software for personal media players (PMPs) and secondary display-enabled computers. PortalPlayer, which was founded in 1999, is widely recognized for its pioneering technology, including the high-performance system-on-chip (SoC) technology which powers some of the world's most recognizable portable digital music players.
SANTA CLARA, CANOVEMBER 6, 2006
Under terms of the agreement, NVIDIA will pay $13.50 in cash for each outstanding share of PortalPlayer common stock, which represents a total purchase price of approximately $357 million, or approximately $161 million net of cash on PortalPlayer's balance sheet as of September 30, 2006. The purchase price represents approximately a 19 percent premium to the 20-day average closing price of PortalPlayer through Friday, November 3, 2006. This acquisition has been approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
"Modern mobile devices are miniaturized yet powerful multimedia computers. At the core of their architectures are complex Application Processors integrating microprocessors, system logic, networking, and multimedia processors," said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. "With this acquisition, we are combining the two essential technologies of next-generation PMPs, PDAs, portable game players, and phones: PortalPlayer's innovative Application Processor technology and NVIDIA's industry-leading GPU technology. With the products created through this combination, we intend to drive the next digital revolution, where the mobile device becomes our most personal computer."
"We are excited about the next chapter in our corporate history," added Richard Sanquini, chairman of the PortalPlayer Board of Directors. "We believe the deal is a win-win for our employees and shareholders. We have spent the past several months extensively exploring our strategic options. We feel the advantages offered by the NVIDIA acquisition are the most compelling, and that our customers and employees will benefit from NVIDIA's strong position in handheld GPU technologies and its vast resources and global reach."
The acquisition of PortalPlayer is expected to accelerate NVIDIA's ongoing investment in its handheld product strategy. Today, NVIDIA's handheld technology, which combines high-quality graphics, TV, and video with low power and a small footprint, is at the foundation of many industry-leading portable media devices, including phones from Motorola, Samsung, Kyocera, HTC, and Sony Ericsson.
Goldman, Sachs & Co., served as financial advisor to NVIDIA. Cowen and Company, LLC served as financial advisor to PortalPlayer.
More details will be provided during NVIDIA's quarterly conference call to be held on Thursday, November 9, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific time).To listen to the conference call, please dial 706-679-0543; no password is required.

SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 29, 2006,   NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) filed an amended Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, a Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006 and a Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 30, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it described that it had identified a number of occasions on which the Company had used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes for stock option grants made in certain prior periods. As a result of this determination, the Company launched a tender offer pursuant to a Schedule TO which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 29, 2006. The tender offer is being made with respect to certain stock option grants held by existing employees for which the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the corrected measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes exceeded the exercise price of the stock option grant, but only to the extent that such stock option grants may be subject to potential tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the proposed regulations issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service thereunder. Under the terms of the tender offer as approved by the Board of Directors, no executive officer or member of the Companys Board of Directors is eligible to participate. Mr. Huang, a member of the Companys Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, holds three stock option grants potentially subject to tax under Section 409A. On November 27, 2006, the Board of Directors (with Mr. Huang abstaining) elected to amend Mr. Huangs affected three stock option grants to increase the grant price of such options to equal the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the new measurement date as determined for financial accounting and reporting purposes. The increased prices are set forth in the table below. Mr. Huang consented to such amendments.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, CAFEBRUARY 13, 2007
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the fiscal year ended January 28, 2007.
For the fourth quarter of
fiscal 200
7, revenue increased to a record $878.9 million, compared to $633.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of 39 percent.  Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $163.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $97.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, a net income increase of 68 percent.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes a charge for in-process research and development related to our acquisition of Portal Player, Inc., plus SFAS 123R and other stock-based compensation charges and the associated payroll tax impact, was $205.6 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.
Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2007 was a record $3.07 billion, compared to revenue of $2.38 billion for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, an increase of 29 percent. GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2007 was $448.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $301.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, a net income increase of 49 percent.
Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2007, which excludes a charge for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Portal Player, Inc., a one-time charge associated with licensing certain patents, plus SFAS 123R and other stock-based compensation charges and the associated payroll tax impact, was $577.9 million, or $1.50 per diluted share.
Fiscal 2007 was an outstanding year, stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. Our record year is a result of intense focus on building market-defining products and financial performance. We established the number one position in multiple categories - desktop GPUs, notebook GPUs, workstation GPUs, and AMD chipsets. Most importantly, we significantly enhanced our strategic position in the markets we serve.
Looking ahead into fiscal 2008, we expect multiple growth drivers - driving deeper into the Intel segment with our branded motherboard GPUs, delivering our first application processor for the handheld market, and launching the GPU Computing era with GPUs designed to dramatically accelerate high-performance computing. This is the year the industry ramps three very new applications that are enhanced with our GPUs - Vista, DX10, and HD/Blu-ray DVD. It is exciting that the GPU is becoming an increasingly central part of our computing experience, added Mr. Huang.
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2007 Highlights:
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter fiscal 2007 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time (5:00 P.M. Eastern Time). To listen to the call, please dial (706) 679-0543. A live Web cast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be held at the NVIDIA investor relations Web site
http://nvidia.com/ir
and at
http://www.streetevents.com
. The Web cast will be recorded and available for replay until the Companys conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter fiscal 2008.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share, and other non-GAAP line items from the Consolidated Statements of Income, including cost of revenue information, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses (including research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses) and income tax expense. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a non-GAAP presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Income as reconciled against the GAAP presentation. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude stock-based compensation, in-process R&D related to acquisitions, certain non-recurring charges associated with settling IP matters, and related tax differences. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP results enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 10.1
Overview
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the 
Company
) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Senior Officers, Directors and Managers as defined below (collectively, the Participants), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2008 and are employees of the Company on and as of January 27, 2008, shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2008 Variable Compensation Plan (the 
Plan
). The Plan is designed to award a cash payment (each a 
Variable Cash Payment
) for performance in fiscal year 2008 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets (
Corporate Targets
) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below) and/or certain Individual Rankings (as defined below).
For purposes of the Plan, the Companys chief executive officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered 
Senior Officers
,
 other employees at the level of vice president or director shall be considered 
Directors
 and managers or qualifying senior contributors shall be considered 
Managers
. The Compensation Committee (the 
Committee
) shall determine (i) the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan, (ii) the class of employees who may be designated by Senior Officers as Directors for purposes of this Plan and (iii) the class of employees who many be designated by Senior Officers or Directors as Managers for purposes of this Plan.
For fiscal year 2008, for purposes of the Plan, 
Individual Targets
 shall be set for Senior Officers and Directors as follows:
For fiscal year 2008, for purposes of the Plan, 
Individual Rankings
 for Managers shall be the ranking of such Manager in January or February 2008 by the Senior Officer or Director to whom the Manager reports.
Determination of Fiscal Year 2008 Variable Cash Payments
Senior Officers and Directors are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or the Senior Officer or Director achieves their Individual Targets at specified levels. Managers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or based on the level of their Individual Ranking. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of the Corporate Targets and/or his or her Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (the 
Variable Cash Payment Target Amount
). A Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2008, each Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the 
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, (the 
Individual Variable Cash Payment
). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Variable Cash Payment Target Amount as described more fully below.
Individual Variable Cash Payment
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, or other criteria determined by the Committee.
The actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2008 (the 
Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved or the level of the Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the amount of the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment shall be determined as follows:
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, or in the case of a Manager who does not reach his or her Individual Ranking, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), Senior Officers (for other Directors) or Senior Officers or Directors (for Managers who report to such Senior Officer or Director, as applicable), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants, based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2008 net income. The amount of actual net income, as set forth in the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2008, but (i) excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) excluding or including items that the Committee in its sole discretion deems to be extraordinary or otherwise inappropriate to include or appropriate to include, shall be the 
Actual Result
. The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2008 for Participants, for the award of all of or a portion of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the 
Threshold
 and 
Maximum
). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2008 (the 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines:
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment =
   (Actual Result - Threshold)  
x Corporate Variable Cash Payment
(Corporate Target - Threshold)
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment = [(
Actual Result - Corporate Target
) +1] x Corporate Variable Cash 
 
Payment
                                                                              
(Maximum - Corporate Target)
In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Payment.
If a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
Miscellaneous Provisions
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Companys employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
The Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Corporate Targets, Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking and/or Corporate and/or Individual Variable Cash Payment amounts at any time.
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
 
On April 24, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan, subject to approval by our stockholders. The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards, collectively, the stock awards. Stock awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan to our employees, directors and consultants.
 
If approved by stockholders at our 2007 Annual Meeting, which is scheduled for June 21, 2007, the 2007 Plan will consolidate and replace all of our outstanding equity incentive plans. Specifically, the 2007 Plan will succeed our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, our 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, our 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, which we assumed when we acquired PortalPlayer, Inc. in January 2007. We refer to all our outstanding equity incentive plans together as the Prior Plans.
 
The maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2007 Plan is 101,845,177 shares, which is equal to (i) all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (including shares subject to issuance under outstanding stock awards previously granted under the Prior Plans), which amount is approximately 91,978,851 shares as of April 6, 2007, and (ii) a number of shares, to be determined as of the date the 2007 Plan is approved by our stockholders, that when added to the number of shares then remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans, results in a total share reserve of 101,845,177 shares of common stock, which, as of April 6, 2007, was approximately 9,666,326 shares. The shares of common stock subject to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan (including any awards granted under the Prior Plans) that expire, are forfeited because of a failure to vest, or otherwise terminate without being exercised in full will return to the 2007 Plan and be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The shares issued upon the exercise of awards outstanding under the Prior Plans will reduce the shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.
 
In the event of a corporate transaction or a change of control, outstanding stock awards under the 2007 Plan may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) any stock awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction will become fully vested and exercisable and will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the transaction, and (b) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the transaction.
 
The Board or a duly appointed committee thereof may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. The 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate immediately prior to the 10
th
anniversary of the date it was adopted by the Compensation Committee. No rights may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board or a duly appointed committee thereof may amend or modify the 2007 Plan at any time, subject to any required stockholder approval. To the extent required by applicable law or regulation, and except as otherwise provided in the 2007 Plan, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that (a) materially increases the number of shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, (b) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive stock awards under the 2007 Plan, (c) materially increases the benefits accruing to the participants under the 2007 Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares of common stock may be issued or purchased under the 2007 Plan, (d) materially extends the term of the 2007 Plan, or (e) expands the types of awards available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.
 
The 2007 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2007 Plan.

GENERAL.
 
(a)
  
Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans.
The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the 
1998 Plan
), the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the 
Prior Plans
). Following the Effective Date, no additional stock awards shall be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards shall be subject to the terms of this Plan except as follows: from the Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the 
Transition Date
) (during which time the Company anticipates taking such steps as are
necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States
), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan covering up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States
(such 100,000 share reserve, the 
Foreign Transition Reserve
). On the Effective Date, all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (such reserve, including the Foreign Transition Reserve and shares subject to issuance under outstanding options and other stock awards that were previously granted under the Prior Plans, the 
Prior Plan Reserve
) shall become available for issuance under the Plan;
provided, however
, that the issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards granted following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign Transition Reserve) shall occur from this Plan and shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan as provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise or settlement shall become available for issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(b) below. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans shall remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
 
(b)
  
Eligible Award Recipients.
The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
 
(c)
  
Available Awards.

(d)
  
Purpose.
The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive Awards as set forth in Section
1(b)
, to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the Common Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
 
2.
  
ADMINISTRATION.
 
(a)
  
Administration by Board.
The Board shall administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees, as provided in Section
2(c)
.
 
(b)
  
Powers of Board.
The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
 
(i)
  
To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Awards; (B) when and how each Award shall be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award shall be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and (E) the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Award shall be granted to each such person.
 
(ii)
  
To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan or Award fully effective.
 
(iii)
  
To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
 
(iv)
  
To accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.
 
(v)
  
To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted while the Plan is in effect except with the written consent of the affected Participant.
 
(vi)
  
To amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bring the Plan or Stock Awards granted under the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section
9(a)
relating to Capitalization Adjustments, stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) expands the types of Awards available for issuance under the Plan, but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements.

(vii)
  
To submit any amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding Incentive Stock Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
 
(viii)

(i)
  
Restrictions on Transfer.

Beneficiary Designation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionholder may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company and any broker designated by the Company to effect Option exercises, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionholder, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or administrator of the Optionholders estate shall be entitled to exercise the Option.
 
(e)
  
Vesting of Options Generally.
The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary;
provided, however
, that in all cases, in the event that an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service. The provisions of this Section
5(e)
are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to which an Option may be exercised.

If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(g)
  
Extension of Termination Date.
If the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service (other than upon the Optionholders death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.
 
(h)
  
Disability of Optionholder.
In the event that an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholders Disability, the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination of Continuous Service), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(i)
  
Death of Optionholder.
In the event that (i) an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholders death (which termination event shall give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), or (ii) the Optionholder dies within the period (if any) specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event shall not give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of death) by the Optionholders estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionholders death, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (A) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after the Optionholders death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(j)
  
Non-Exempt Employees
. No Option granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of grant of the Option. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Board determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the payment of benefits under such Award shall be accelerated to the minimum extent necessary so that the benefit is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code; provided, however, that if the payment of benefits pursuant to such accelerated schedule would still be subject to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, the payment of such benefits shall not be so accelerated and shall instead be delayed to the first possible payment date after the intended payment date so that such benefits are not subject to the provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, so long as no such adjustments shall result in payments under the Award being subject to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. In addition, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement (including but not limited to increasing the exercise price of an Award to the extent required for the avoidance of the tax consequences set forth in Section 409A(a)(1)) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SANTA CLARA, CAMAY 10, 2007
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 ended April 29, 2007.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008 revenues were $844.3 million, compared to $681.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, an increase of 24 percent.
Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $132.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of 44 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which excludes stock-based compensation charges and the associated tax impact, was $164.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share,
 
an increase of 48 percent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Compared to last year, first quarter revenue grew 24 percent and non-GAAP net income increased 48 percent. With our continued focused on operational excellence, gross margins achieved a company record. We maintained leadership positions in each of our core product lines, which positions us for continued growth throughout the year, stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA.
Our growth reflects the ever growing importance of the GPU across a broad range of computing and digital devices. The GPU is one of the most important enablers for the digital consumer era. Over the next 10 years, we estimate that over 10 billion GPUs will be needed to power PCs, mobile devices, cars, TVs, and game consoles. Our strategy is clear and focused - to be the world leader in GPUs and capitalize on this exciting opportunity, added Mr. Huang.
First Quarter Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2008 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time (5:00 P.M. Eastern Time). To listen to the call, please dial (706) 679-0543. A live Web cast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be held at the NVIDIA investor relations Web site
www.nvidia.com/ir
and at
http://www.streetevents.com
. The Web cast will be recorded and available for replay until the Companys conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter fiscal 2008.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share, and other non-GAAP line items from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, including cost of revenue information, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses (including research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses) and income tax expense. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a non-GAAP presentation of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as reconciled against the GAAP presentation. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude stock-based compensation, a non-recurring credit associated with the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and the associated tax impact. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP results enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SECTION 8 - Other Events
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
During fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Company worked with members of the Companys management and outside counsel to document and refine the Companys stock option grant practices. Once completed, the written stock option grant procedures (the Procedures) were presented to the Audit Committee for its review and approval. The Procedures were then reviewed and approved by the full Board on September 12, 2006. The Procedures are designed to enhance the Companys existing stock option grant process by providing additional approval processes for stock option awards, further delineating/clarifying specific responsibilities for relevant Company personnel, and providing for multiple layers of review. The Committee has reviewed and revised the Procedures as needed since their adoption. The Company has used the Procedures for all option grants since their adoption.

At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2007, the stockholders of NVIDIA Corporation approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan. The following is a summary of the material terms of our 2007 Plan.
. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. The 2007 Plan succeeds our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, our 1998 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan, our 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, or the Prior Plans.
Description of the 2007 Plan
. Up to 101,845,177 shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. The maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (including shares subject to issuance under outstanding stock awards previously granted under the Prior Plans), and (ii) a number of shares, to be determined as of the date the 2007 Plan was approved by the stockholders, that when added to the number of shares then remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans as of such date of approval, results in a total share reserve of 101,845,177 shares of our common stock.
Stock Subject to the 2007 Plan
Our Board of Directors, or the Board, or its duly authorized committee determines the terms of each stock option granted under our 2007 Plan, including the exercise price, the form of consideration paid on exercise, the vesting schedule, restrictions on transfer and the term. The exercise price of a stock option granted under the 2007 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date of grant (for an incentive stock option, not less than 110% if the optionee is a 10% holder). The term of an option will not be longer than ten years (although options generally expire prior to such time in connection with a termination of continued service) and may be subject to restrictions on transfer.
General Terms of Options.
In the event of a corporate transaction or a change of control, outstanding stock awards under the 2007 Plan may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (i) as to any stock awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction, the vesting and exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction, and (ii) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction.
Corporate Transactions; Changes of Control.
. The 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on April 23, 2017. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at anytime. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require stockholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the stockholders have approved the amendment.
Duration, Termination
This description of the 2007 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2007 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits.

    To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iii)
    To accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.

(i)    General.
    In the sole discretion of the Board, the Committee may consist solely of two or more Outside Directors, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, and/or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3.

(d)    Delegation to Officers.
provided, however,
    All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith shall not be subject to review by any person and shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

.    If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock Award (, "net exercised") or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld in satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, or the issuance of shares under a Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to Section 8(g), the number of shares that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise price of any Stock Award is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(ii)    Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance
i.e.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(c), subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) shall be one hundred one million, eight hundred forty-five thousand, one hundred seventy-seven (101,845,177) shares of Common Stock.

All Options shall be separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate certificate or certificates shall be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option, then the Option shall be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical; , that each Option Agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner consistent with the provisions of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code (whether or not such options are Incentive Stock Options).
(b)    Exercise Price.
    The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below. The Board shall have the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to utilize a particular method of payment.

(ii)
    by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock;
(iii)
    by a "net exercise" arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price; that the Company shall accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the "net exercise," (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv)
provided, however,
provided, further,
    in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board.
(v)
    The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on the transferability of Options as the Board shall determine. If the Board determines that an Option shall be transferable, the Option shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the following restrictions on the transferability of Options shall apply:
(d)    Transferability of Options.
    No ISO granted under this Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Nonqualified Stock Options shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionholder only by the Optionholder; , that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option in a manner consistent with applicable tax and securities laws upon the Optionholder's request.
(i)    Restrictions on Transfer.
provided, however
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order, that an Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(ii)    Domestic Relations Orders.
provided, however,
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionholder may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company and any broker designated by the Company to effect Option exercises, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionholder, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or administrator of the Optionholder's estate shall be entitled to exercise the Option.
(iii)    Beneficiary Designation.
    The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary; , that in all cases, in the event that an Optionholder's Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service. The provisions of this Section 5(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to which an Option may be exercised.
(e)    Vesting of Options Generally.
provided, however
    Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Option Agreement or other agreement between the Optionholder and the Company, in the event that an Optionholder's Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionholder's death or Disability), the Optionholder may
(f)    Termination of Continuous Service.
 
exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date ninety (90) days following the termination of the Optionholder's Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
    If the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionholder's Continuous Service (other than upon the Optionholder's death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the termination of the Optionholder's Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.
(g)    Extension of Termination Date.
    In the event that an Optionholder's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholder's Disability, the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination of Continuous Service), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
(h)    Disability of Optionholder.
    In the event that (i) an Optionholder's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholder's death (which termination event shall give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), or (ii) the Optionholder dies within the period (if any) specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of the Optionholder's Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event shall not give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of death) by the Optionholder's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionholder's death, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (A) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after the Optionholder's death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
(i)    Death of Optionholder.
.    No Option granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of grant of the Option. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay.
(j)    Non-Exempt Employees
 
Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate.

If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant shall not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award or the subsequent issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.

In addition, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement (including but not limited to increasing the exercise price of an Award to the extent required for the avoidance of the tax consequences set forth in Section 409A(a)(1)) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.

On April 15, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved the Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2009 Plan, which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to our chief executive officer, senior officers, vice presidents, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors, or the Participants, as determined by our Compensation Committee, if certain pre-set corporate and individual targets are achieved during fiscal 2009. We operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the Sunday nearest January 31. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends; e.g., fiscal 2009 refers to our fiscal year ending January 25, 2009.
Under the 2009 Plan, variable cash compensation will be paid to the Participants if we exceed pre-set threshold, target or maximum net income levels, determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, as set by our Compensation Committee and/or if individuals achieve their individual targets which are determined by our Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and based on individual rankings for managers and other qualifying senior contributors. Fifty percent (50%) of a Participant's potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achievement of corporate targets (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participant's corporate target award) and fifty percent (50%) will be allocated to the achievement of individual targets.
Variable compensation resulting from achievement of the corporate targets is determined by our Compensation Committee. The achievement of individual targets is determined by our Compensation Committee in the case of the chief executive officer and the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and by the senior officer or director to whom a manager or senior contributor reports in the case of managers and senior contributors.
Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee reserve the right to modify these targets and criteria at any time or to grant additional variable cash compensation to the Participants even if the performance targets are not met.
The 2009 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the 2009 Plan.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
Overview
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the "Company") is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Senior Officers, Directors and Managers as defined below (collectively, the "Participants"), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2009 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), are employees of the Company on and as of the date the cash payments are awarded (each a "Variable Cash Payment"), shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment for performance in fiscal year 2009 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets ("Corporate Targets") and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below) and/or certain Individual Rankings (as defined below).
For purposes of the Plan, the Company's chief executive officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered "Senior Officers," other employees at the level of vice president or director shall be considered "Directors" and managers or qualifying senior contributors shall be considered "Managers." The Committee shall determine (i) the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan, (ii) the class of employees who may be designated by Senior Officers as Directors for purposes of this Plan and (iii) the class of employees who many be designated by Senior Officers or Directors as Managers for purposes of this Plan.
For fiscal year 2009, for purposes of the Plan, "Individual Targets" shall be set for Senior Officers and Directors as follows:
 
 
 
For fiscal year 2009, for purposes of the Plan, "Individual Rankings" for Managers shall be the ranking of such Manager in January or February 2009 by the Senior Officer or Director to whom the Manager reports.
Determination of Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Cash Payments
Senior Officers and Directors are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or the Senior Officer or Director achieves their Individual Targets at specified levels. Managers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or based on the level of their Individual Ranking. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of the Corporate Targets and/or his or her Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (the "Variable Cash Payment Target Amount"). A Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2009, each Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the "Corporate Variable Cash Payment") and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, (the "Individual Variable Cash Payment"). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Variable Cash Payment Target Amount as described more fully below.
Individual Variable Cash Payment
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, or other criteria determined by the Committee.
The actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2009 (the "Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments") shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved or the level of the Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the amount of the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment shall be determined as follows:
 
 
 
 
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, or in the case of a Manager who does not reach his or her Individual Ranking, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), Senior Officers (for other Directors) or Senior Officers or Directors (for Managers who report to such Senior Officer or Director, as applicable), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants, based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2009 net income. The amount of actual net income, as set forth in the Company's financial statements for fiscal 2009, as determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, shall be the "Actual Result." The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2009 for Participants, for the award of all of or a portion of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the "Threshold" and "Maximum"). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2009 (the "Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments") shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines:
 
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment = ((Actual Result - Threshold) / (Corporate Target - Threshold)) * (50% of Variable Cash Payment Target Amount)
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment = (1 + ((Actual Result - Corporate Target) / (Maximum - Corporate Target))) * (50% of Variable Cash Payment Target Amount)
 
In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Payment.
If a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
Miscellaneous Provisions
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Company's employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
The Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Corporate Targets, Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking and/or Corporate and/or Individual Variable Cash Payment amounts at any time.
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA), the world leader in visual computing technologies, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended April 27, 2008.
SANTA CLARA, CAMAY 8, 2008
 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, revenue was $1.15 billion, compared to $844.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, an increase of 37 percent. Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 increased by 34 percent year-over-year to $176.8 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which excludes stock-based compensation charges and the associated tax impact, was $211.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share.
 
The growth of GPUs continues to outpace the PC market.  We shipped 42 percent more GPUs this quarter compared to the same period a year ago, resulting in our best first quarter ever, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. This is the era of visual computing.  With a few hundred million GeForce GPUs in the market, developers can now confidently create applications with dazzling graphics.  Amazing applications with beautiful graphics are showing up on the Web constantly, driving even faster adoption of GPUs.  We expect this positive feedback loop to continue to drive our growth.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, and the associated tax impact, where applicable. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 2, 2008, NVIDIA Corporation stated that it would take a $150 million to $200 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other consequential costs and expenses arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products used in notebook systems. All newly manufactured products and all products currently shipping in volume have a different and more robust material set.
The previous generation MCP and GPU products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities. Certain notebook configurations of these MCP and GPU products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates. While we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures, testing suggests a weak material set of die/package combination, system thermal management designs, and customer use patterns are contributing factors. We have developed and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips. We have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the MCP and GPU products in their notebook system designs. We intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted MCP and GPU products that fail.
We have begun discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set. We will also seek to access our insurance coverage. We continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using NVIDIA products other than certain notebook configurations. However, we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products. There can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other MCP or GPU products.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
SANTA CLARA, CAAUGUST 12, 2008
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended July 27, 2008.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, revenue decreased to $892.7 million compared to $935.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of five percent.  For the six months ended July 27, 2008, revenue increased to $2.05 billion compared to $1.78 billion for the six months ended July 29, 2007, an increase of 15 percent.
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, NVIDIA recorded a $196 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and associated costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products used in notebook systems.
 
NVIDIAs results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included a net loss of $120.9 million, or a loss of $0.22 per share.  Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, the non-recurring warranty charge against cost of revenue, and the associated tax impact, was $74.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.
 
GAAP net income for the six months ended July 27, 2008 was $55.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $305.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the six months ended July 29, 2007. Non-GAAP net income for the six months ended July 27, 2008, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, the non-recurring warranty charge against cost of revenue, and the associated tax impact, was $286.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $362.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the six months ended July 29, 2007.
 
Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing.  The desktop PC market around the world weakened during the quarter. And our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop GPU business. We have a great product line-up and, having taken the necessary pricing actions, we are strongly positioned again.  Our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. In contrast, the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business.  The notebook GPU, MCP, and Professional Solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year-over year.
 
Mr. Huang added, Though we approach the near term with caution, we remain very optimistic about the expanding universe of visual computing and the exciting growth opportunities made possible by CUDA, our general purpose parallel computing architecture.
 
NVIDIA also announced an increase of $1 billion to its stock repurchase program under which it may now purchase up to $2.7 billion of its common stock. Through July 27, 2008, NVIDIA has repurchased 68.0 million shares under the stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.16 billion.
 
The repurchases will be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and may be made from time to time or in one or more larger repurchases. The program will be conducted in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Rule 10b-18 and applicable legal requirements and shall be subject to market conditions and other factors.
 
The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The purchases will be funded from available working capital.
 
Second Quarter Fiscal 2009 Highlights and Recent Developments:
 
 
 
 
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2009 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time (5:00 P.M. Eastern Time). To listen to the call, please dial (212) 231-2901.

On September 18, 2008, NVIDIA Corporation announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas. As a result, NVIDIA expects to eliminate approximately 360 positions worldwide, or about 6.5 percent of our global workforce. The reduction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending October 26, 2008. We expect to record restructuring-related charges of approximately $7 million to $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the reduction. These pre-tax charges are comprised of severance and related expenses and are expected to be charged primarily against our operating expenses.
 
In connection with, and contingent upon, the corporate workforce reduction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a proposal by management to reduce to zero any individual variable cash payments that would be payable to our executive officers pursuant to the NVIDIA Corporation Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan. Fiscal 2009 ends January 25, 2009. The Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2008.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 16, 2008, NVIDIA Corporation executed a settlement agreement, or the Agreement, in connection with the consolidated action , MDL No. 1826, pending in the District Court for the Northern District of California, or the Action. The Agreement relates to the claims of the certified class of direct purchaser plaintiffs previously approved by the District Court, which consists of purchasers who bought graphics cards directly from the websites of ATI Technologies ULC or NVIDIA in the United States during the period December 4, 2002 to November 7, 2007. The Agreement calls for NVIDIA to pay $850,000 into a $1.7 million fund to be made available for payments to the certified class. We are not obligated under the Agreement to pay plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, costs, or make any other payments in connection with the settlement other than our payment of $850,000. The Agreement is subject to court approval and, if approved, would dispose of all claims and appeals raised by the certified class in the Action against NVIDIA.
In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation
We have also reached a settlement agreement with the remaining individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the Action. On July 18, 2008, the District Court denied a motion seeking to certify a class of all indirect purchasers in the United States who purchased a product containing a graphics processing unit initially sold by NVIDIA or the other defendants in the Action. On September 9, 2008, NVIDIA reached a settlement agreement with the remaining individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs that provides for NVIDIA to pay $112,500 in exchange for a dismissal of all claims and appeals related to the Action raised by the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs. This settlement is not subject to the approval of the District Court. Pursuant to the settlement, the individual indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the Action have dismissed their claims and withdrawn their appeal of the class certification ruling.

Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute, a restructuring charge against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact, was $111.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share.
 
GAAP net income for the nine months ended October 26, 2008 was $117.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $540.7 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the nine months ended October 28, 2007.  Non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended October 26, 2008, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute,a non-recurring warranty charge against cost of revenue, a restructuring charge against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact was $397.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to $626.7 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, for the nine months ended October 28, 2007.
 
 
 
We made good progress on multiple fronts during the quarter, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA.  Improving gross margin while managing operating expenses enabled us to significantly improve our operating fundamentals.  We transitioned our performance segment GPUs to 55 nanometers and are now poised to recapture lost share.  We entered the fastest growing segment of the PC market with our first notebook chipset for Intel processors, and delivered on several exciting new growth initiatives  3-way SLI for the Intel Core i7 processor platform, Quadro CX for Adobe CS4 creative professionals and the Tesla supercomputing processor.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute, a non-recurring warranty charge against cost of revenue, a restructuring charge against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact, where applicable. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
SANTA CLARA, CAFEBRUARY 10, 2009
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today 
reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the fiscal year ended January 25, 2009.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, revenue was $481.1 million compared to $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 60 percent. For the twelve months ended January 25, 2009, revenue was $3.4 billion compared to $4.1 billion for the twelve months ended January 27, 2008, a decrease of 16 percent.
 
NVIDIAs results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included a net loss of $147.7 million, or $0.27 per share.  Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, a benefit from insurance proceeds received, a non-recurring charge against operating expenses related to termination of a development agreement, a restructuring credit against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact of these items, was $94.4 million, or $0.18 per share.
 
GAAP net loss for the twelve months ended January 25, 2009 was $30.0 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to net income of $797.6 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended January 27, 2008.  Non-GAAP net income for the twelve months ended January 25, 2009, which excludes stock-based compensation charges, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute,a non-recurring warranty charge against cost of revenue, a benefit from insurance proceeds received, a non-recurring charge against operating expenses related to termination of a development agreement, a restructuring charge against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact of these items, was $303.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $919.3 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended January 27, 2008.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The environment is clearly difficult and uncertain.  Our first priority is to set an operating expense level that balances cash conservation while allowing us to continue to invest in initiatives that are of great importance to the market and in which we believe we have industry leadership.  We have initiatives in all areas to reduce operating expenses, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA.  Although fiscal 2009 was extremely difficult, it was one of our best years of innovation.  We made many important advances in graphics processing with PhysX and 3D Vision, GPU computing with CUDA and Tesla, and mobile computing with ION and Tegra.  I am pleased with the excellent achievements we made in each of these important areas.

On February 12, 2009, the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved and adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws, or Restated Bylaws. The Restated Bylaws were effective as of February 12, 2009. The Restated Bylaws set forth more explicitly the processes and procedures that our stockholders must follow, and specify additional information that our stockholders must provide, when proposing director nominations and other business in light of the increased usage of more complex voting and ownership arrangements. Additionally, the Restated Bylaws are intended to ensure that our stockholders and NVIDIA have a reasonable opportunity to consider nominations and other business proposed to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders and to allow for full information to be distributed to stockholders.
The Restated Bylaws:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The preceding is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.

The registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware shall be in the City of Dover, County of Kent.
Section 1. Registered Office.
The corporation shall also have and maintain an office or principal place of business at such place as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, and may also have offices at such other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require.
Section 2. Other Offices.
The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate seal. The corporate seal shall consist of a die bearing the name of the corporation and the inscription, "Corporate Seal-Delaware." Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
Section 3. Corporate Seal.
Meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, or, if not so designated, then at the principal executive offices of the corporation required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of these Bylaws. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as provided under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").
Section 4. Place of Meetings.
Section 5. Annual Meetings.
The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose of election of directors and for such other business as may properly come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. At an annual meeting, only such business shall be conducted as is a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL and as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. Matters be properly brought before the annual meeting only as follows: (i) brought before the meeting and specified pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting of stockholders; (ii) otherwise brought
(a)
specifically by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5; provided, that if such matter is proposed on behalf of a beneficial owner it may only be properly brought before the meeting, if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the corporation at the time of the giving of the stockholder's notice provided for in Section 5(b) below. Clause (iii) above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations and submit other business (other than matters properly included in the corporation's notice of meeting of stockholders and proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1934 Act")) before an annual meeting of stockholders.
At an annual meeting of the stockholders, the following procedures shall apply in order for a matter to be properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.
(b)
For nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(b)(iii) and must update and supplement such written notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c).

The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee.

 Stockholders shall not be permitted to propose business to be brought before a special meeting of stockholders and the only matters that may be brought before a special meeting are the matters specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the person calling the meeting. The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting. Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws.

(b)
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in these Bylaws who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i); provided, that if such nominee(s) are proposed on behalf of a beneficial owner such nominations may only be properly brought before the meeting, if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the corporation at the time of the giving of the stockholder's notice set forth in this paragraph. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 5(b)(i) of these Bylaws shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes or series.

For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast as "withheld" for that director. If a director then serving on the Board of Directors does not receive the necessary votes, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken.

Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue. Each certificate shall state upon the face or back thereof, in full or in summary, all of the powers, designations, preferences, and rights, and the limitations or restrictions of the shares authorized to be issued or shall, except as otherwise required by law, set forth on the face or back a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

Section 41. Transactions with Interested Parties.
the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or

Section 45. Fiscal Year.
Section 46. Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents.
The corporation shall indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XII, "executive officers" shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law; , , that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive officers.
(a) Directors and Executive Officers.
provided
however
The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person (other than as specified in clause (a) above) to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
(b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents.
The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding; , , that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or an executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or an executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit

c) Expenses.
provided

plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 46, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of any undertaking, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
(d) Enforcement.
The rights conferred on any person by this Section 46 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.
(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(f) Survival of Rights.
To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, or any other applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 46.
(g) Insurance.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 46 that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
(h) Amendments.
If this Section 46 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Section 46 that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section 46 shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.
(i) Saving Clause.
For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply:
(j) Certain Definitions.

(3)
 References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as, respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

(a) Notice to Stockholders. 
Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by overnight delivery service, facsimile, telex or telegram, except that such notice other than one which is delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director.
(b) Notice to Directors.
An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, or other agent, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained.

The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such director to receive such notice.
(e) Failure to Receive Notice.
It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all recipients of notice, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
(f) Methods of Notice.
Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
(g) Notice to Person with Whom Communication Is Unlawful.
 
Except as otherwise prohibited under DGCL, any notice given under the provisions of DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Such consent shall have been deemed to have been given if such stockholder fails to object in writing to the corporation within sixty (60) days of having been given notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice. Any consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.
(h) Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address.

In addition to your base salary, you will be eligible to earn an annual incentive compensation targeted at $385,000.00 less payroll deductions and required holdings ("Annual Incentive Compensation"), which will be pro-rated based on your start date for fiscal year 2010 (February 2009 - January 2010). Your Annual Incentive Compensation will be based on the Company's performance against certain objectives (50%) and your accomplishment of key objectives established for you by the Company (50%). You must remain employed with the Company through the end of the fiscal year in order to be eligible to receive any Incentive Compensation for that year and remain employed with the Company through the time of the distribution in order to receive any of your Incentive Compensation. As we have discussed, for fiscal year 2010 the Company guarantees your eligibility for payout under the 50% portion linked to individual performance.

Subject to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation, and to the terms of NVIDIA Corporation's Equity Incentive Plan, you will receive an option to purchase 450,000 shares of NVIDIA Corporation's Common Stock at an exercise price per share that is equal to the fair market value of a share of NVIDIA Corporation's Common Stock on the date of grant (the "Option"). The shares subject to the Option will vest in equal quarterly allotments over a four (4) year period, provided you remain employed with NVIDIA.
In the event your employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated (i) within the first twelve (12) months of your employment, and (ii) as a direct result of the successful completion of an Acquisition of the Company, with respect to your initial stock option, as of the date your employment ends, you will vest in (and be able to exercise) the number of shares that would have vested had you remained employed with the Company for one year from the date your employment began. For purposes of this paragraph, an Acquisition of the Company means: (1) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than in connection with a reorganization; (2) a merger, reverse merger or consolidation of the Company where the stockholders immediately prior to the merger do not own fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the surviving corporation after the merger; or (3) the acquisition by any

Attached is a copy of a Proprietary Information Agreement, which you must read and sign prior to beginning your employment. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the agreement.
You may terminate your employment with the Company at any time simply by notifying the Company. Likewise, the Company may terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.
As required by law, this offer is subject to satisfactory proof of your right to work in the United States. You should bring the appropriate document(s) with you (see attached Employment Verification letter that lists acceptable documents) when you report to work.
This offer is contingent upon receipt of any export license or other approval that may be required under United States export control laws and regulations. We are not obligated to apply for any export license or other approval that may be required, nor can we guarantee that the United States Government will issue an export license or other approval, in the event that we do file an application.
This letter, together with the attached Proprietary Information Agreement, contains the entire agreement between you and NVIDIA concerning your employment relationship. It cannot be modified except in a signed agreement and it supersedes any other representations or promises made to you by anyone, whether oral or written. I'm sending along an extra copy of this letter. If you wish to accept employment at NVIDIA under the terms described above, please indicate by signing this letter and returning it to me.

We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends; e.g., fiscal 2010 refers to our fiscal year ending January 31, 2010.
Historically variable cash compensation has been paid to the Participants if NVIDIA achieved its corporate targets as set by our Compensation Committee and if individuals achieved their individual targets which are set by our Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer and by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers. The achievement of individual targets by our chief executive officer and senior officers is determined by our Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee determined not to establish any corporate targets for compensatory purposes for fiscal 2010 because payout for corporate performance in fiscal year 2010 would not be appropriate in light of the current economic environment and our cost reduction efforts. In addition, in light of the current economic environment and our cost reduction efforts, prior to the consideration of the fiscal 2010 performance targets, our chief executive officer proposed on behalf of the executive officers and the Compensation Committee determined that, except for David White, our new chief financial officer, the executive officers, including our chief executive officer, would not be eligible for any individual performance payouts for fiscal 2010.
Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee reserve the right to:
 
 
The 2010 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the 2010 Plan.
 
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 22, 2008, NVIDIA Corporation entered into Memoranda of Understanding on September 19, 2008 regarding the settlement of the stockholder derivative lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
Overview
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the "Company") is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Certain Senior Officers, Directors and Managers, each as defined below (collectively, the "Participants"), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2010 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), are employees of the Company on and as of the date the cash payments are awarded (each a "Variable Cash Payment"), shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2010 Variable Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment for performance in fiscal year 2010 to a Participant if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below) and/or certain Individual Rankings (as defined below). The Plan will not have Corporate Targets for any Participant.
For purposes of the Plan, only the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered "Senior Officers," other employees at the level of vice president or director shall be considered "Directors" and managers or qualifying senior contributors shall be considered "Managers." The Committee shall determine (i) the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan and the Senior Officers who may be a Participant hereunder, (ii) the class of employees who may be designated by Senior Officers as Directors for purposes of this Plan and (iii) the class of employees who many be designated by Senior Officers or Directors as Managers for purposes of this Plan.
For fiscal year 2010, for purposes of the Plan, "Individual Targets" shall be set for certain Senior Officers and Directors as follows:
 
 
For fiscal year 2010, for purposes of the Plan, "Individual Rankings" for Managers shall be the ranking of such Manager in January or February 2010 by the Senior Officer or Director to whom the Manager reports.
Determination of Fiscal Year 2010 Variable Cash Payments
Certain Senior Officers and Directors are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Senior Officer or Director achieves their Individual Targets at specified levels. Managers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment based on the level of their Individual Ranking. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of his or her Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (the "Variable Cash Payment Target Amount"). A Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2010, each Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is one hundred percent (100%) allocated to the achievement of the Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, (the "Individual Variable Cash Payment"). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Variable Cash Payment Target Amount as described more fully below.
Individual Variable Cash Payment
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, or other criteria determined by the Committee.
The actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2010 (the "Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments") shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved or the level of the Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the amount of the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment shall be determined as follows:
 
 
 
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, or in the case of a Manager who does not reach his or her Individual Ranking, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for certain Senior Officers), Senior Officers (for other Directors) or Senior Officers or Directors (for Managers who report to such Senior Officer or Director, as applicable), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she is not eligible to receive any amounts under this Plan.
Miscellaneous Provisions
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Company's employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
Notwithstanding whether this Plan is referenced in another agreement, policy, arrangement or other document, only the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking and/or Individual Variable Cash Payment amounts at any time.
Any Variable Cash Payments or other benefits under this Plan shall be subject to the Company's Clawback Policy and shall bind all Participants subject to the Clawback Policy who receive any amounts under this Plan.
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NVIDIA REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2010
 
SANTA CLARA, CAMAY 7, 2009
NVIDIA Corporation today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended April 26, 2009.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue was $664.2 million compared with $1.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, a decrease of 42 percent.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, NVIDIA recorded a non-recurring charge of $140.2 million in connection with a previously announced cash tender offer to purchase employee stock options. This charge represents stock-based compensation expense associated with the stock options that were tendered, plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees.
NVIDIAs results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included a net loss of $201.3 million, or $0.37 per share.  Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which excludes recurring stock-based compensation charges, the non-recurring charge related to the tender offer, and the associated tax impact of these items, was $46.7 million, or $0.09 per share.
 
We made good progress managing expenses and significantly reducing inventory, while continuing to invest in our growth strategies, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA.  The GPU is ever-more central to our computing experience.  Theres a rapidly growing number of applications that rely on the GPU, and the industry is gearing up to launch the next generation operating systems that adopt GPU computing.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a non-recurring charge related to previously-announced tender offer, recurring stock-based compensation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 
 
 
 
NVIDIAs business is recovering.  Product demand is improving, and our strategic investments are leading to new growth, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. Our two newest businesses began to ship meaningful amounts of product this past quarter and show significant promise.  Tesla, the industry's first GPU for general-purpose high performance computing, achieved its highest-ever quarterly revenue.  And Tegra, our ultra low-power computer-on-a-chip, is making exciting progress in the market for mobile and embedded devices.  Our new businesses are positioned to benefit from the rise of mobile and cloud computing.
 
NVIDIAs second quarter results were impacted by an additional net charge of approximately $119.1 million to cover costs related to a weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of its previous-generation chips.  Although the number of units impacted by this issue remains consistent with the companys initial estimates a year ago, the cost of remediation and repair of impacted systems has been higher than originally anticipated.  In July 2008, a $196.0 million reserve was accrued for the purpose of supporting our affected customers around the world.  The weak die/package material combination is not used in any products currently in production.
 
GAAP net loss for the six months ended July 26, 2009 was $306.6 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to a net income of $55.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the six months ended July 27, 2008.  Non-GAAP net loss for the six months ended July 26, 2009, which excludes the net charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips, a non-recurring charge of $140.2 million in connection with a previously announced cash tender offer to purchase employee stock options, stock-based compensation charges, and their associated tax impact, was $8.9 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net income of $286.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the six months ended July 27, 2008.
 
Outlook
 
NVIDIA expects revenue in the third quarter ending October 25, 2009, to be up 5 to 7 percent over the second quarter.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow and days sales in inventory. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation chips, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, recurring stock-based compensation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Days sales in inventory is computed by the number of days in the period divided by the non-GAAP inventory turnover ratio.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 41.0 percent, up 4.7 points from the 36.3 percent reported in the previous quarter but slightly off from 41.9 percent a year earlier.
 
GAAP net loss for the nine months ended Oct. 25, 2009 was $199.1 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net income of $117.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the nine months ended Oct. 26, 2008.  Non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended Oct. 25, 2009, which excludes a $93.9 million net charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips, a non-recurring charge of $140.2 million in connection with a cash tender offer to purchase employee stock options, stock-based compensation charges, and their associated tax impact, was $101.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $397.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share for the nine months ended Oct. 26, 2008.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow and days sales in inventory.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation chips, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute, a non-recurring restructuring charge against operating expenses, recurring stock-based compensation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.  Days sales in inventory is computed using GAAP ending inventory multiply by the number of days in the period divided by the non-GAAP cost of revenue.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Summary Results
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $903.2 million, up 16 percent from $776.5 million in the prior quarter and higher than our guidance of 5 to 7 percent growth. Revenue  was also up slightly from a year earlier, the first time this year we have recorded year-over-year improvement, reflecting a third consecutive quarter of strong revenue growth.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 43.4 percent.  Our third quarter GAAP results included a $25.1 million credit for insurance proceeds related to a weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation chips, of which $24.1 million was recorded as a benefit to cost of revenue.  Excluding this benefit, stock-based compensation charges, and their associated tax impact, our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.0 percent, which was significantly up over the prior quarter and also exceeded our guidance.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $107.6 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $105.3 million, or 19 cents per share, in the prior quarter.   Our second quarter results included a net charge of $119.0 million relating to the same weak die/packaging material set issue.
Excluding the insurance proceeds, stock-based compensation, and their associated tax impact, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $110.3 million, or 19 cents per diluted share.  This compares with a non-GAAP net income of $37.7 million, or 7 cents per share in the prior quarter.
Revenue
Our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook and memory, was up almost 25 percent sequentially.   Demand was strong throughout the quarter in both the desktop and notebook segments, with many customers on allocation as a result of stronger than anticipated demand, coupled with supply constraints that limited us throughout the entire quarter, particularly regarding 40nm products.
The desktop segment of our GPU business was up approximately 19 percent quarter-over-quarter, with continued strength across almost all GeForce product-lines, but particularly in the mainstream segment where our new 40nm products have been well received. The majority of our desktop revenue is sold into the channel.  Channel inventories remained in short supply, at approximately one month supply on hand.
 
The notebook segment of our GPU business was up approximately 41 percent quarter-over-quarter.
 
 
Revenue from our 40nm desktop and notebook products contributed approximately 19 percent of  our GPU business revenue versus 3 percent in the previous quarter.  Notwithstanding the significant increase quarter-over-quarter, much of the supply was back-end loaded and limited our ability to fully satisfy demand.
Our MCP business represented 27 percent of total revenue.  Sales of our chipsets designed for Intel-based desktop and notebook PCs were up 33 percent sequentially. However, sales of our chipsets for AMD desktop PCs were down 27 percent because an AMD product transition reduced the availability of entry-level desktop CPUs and thus demand for our associated chipset.
Revenue for our Professional business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 14 percent of total revenue and was up 11 percent quarter-over-quarter.   While revenue growth in this segment continued to lag the rest of our business, this was our largest quarter-over-quarter percentage increase in the last year and we are currently seeing strong quotation activity.
Our Consumer and Other business, which includes Tegra, as well as embedded entertainment, represented 7 percent of total revenue.  Revenue continued to ramp as the first Tegra-based products, the Microsoft Zune HD and Samsungs M1, reached stores in September.
Gross Margin
 
GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 43.4 percent.  Excluding the aforementioned insurance proceeds, stock-based compensation, and their associated tax impact, non-GAAP gross margin was 41.0 percent.  Non-GAAP gross margin was up 4.7 percentage points sequentially, the third consecutive quarterly increase.
Non-GAAP gross margins improved sequentially as a result of several factors:
Expenses and Other
 
GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $283.9 million, up slightly over our estimates.  Sequentially, operating expenses were up $17.1 million primarily due to the bring-ups of various new products, as well as increased legal expenses.
NVIDIAs worldwide employment at the end of the quarter stood at 5,609.
Balance Sheet
 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were up $45.9 million sequentially on $126.7 million of higher revenues.  DSO at quarter-end was 40 days, a 1-day improvement over the prior quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter, which amounted to $277.6 million, were essentially flat compared with the prior quarter.  Inventory days on hand improved to 47,calculated on a non-GAAP basis, a 4-day improvement over the second quarter.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to approximately $48.8 million.  Capital expenditures were $16.6 million.  Each of these was down slightly from the prior quarter.
 
 
Cash flow from operating activities was $141.3 million during the third quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter was a positive $124.7 million.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.63 billion, up approximately $168.0 million from the second quarter, with the principle contributors being higher earnings and improved working capital metrics.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
 
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 is as follows:
We estimate stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter to be $26 million and depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures to be approximately flat when compared to the third quarter.
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 580 million.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Measures
 
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow and days sales in inventory. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation chips, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute, a non-recurring restructuring charge against operating expenses, recurring stock-based compensation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Days sales in inventory is computed using GAAP ending inventory multiply by the number of days in the period divided by the non-GAAP cost of revenue.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Commencing with the fourth quarter, non-GAAP is now defined to include stock based compensation.  As a result, stock-based compensation will no longer be a reconciling item between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. All historical non-GAAP measures presented below have been prepared on this basis.
Summary Results
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $982.5 million, up nearly 9 percent from $903.2 million in the prior quarter and higher than our guidance of around 2 percent growth. Revenue more than doubled from that of a year ago, and represented our fourth consecutive quarter of strong revenue growth.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 44.7 percent, up 1.3 points over the prior quarters GAAP gross margin of 43.4 percent and also above our guidance of 40 to 42 percent.  The companys third quarter results included a $25.1 million credit for insurance proceeds, of which $24.1 million was recorded as a benefit to cost of revenue.  Excluding this benefit, non-GAAP gross margin improved 4.0 points from the third to fourth quarters.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $131.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with a GAAP net income of $107.6 million, or $0.19 per share, in the prior quarter.  Excluding the aforementioned insurance benefit and the associated tax impact, third quarter non-GAAP net income was $77.4 million, or $0.13 share.
Revenue
 
Our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook and memory, was up 23 percent sequentially.   Demand was strong in both the desktop and notebook segments, with many customers experiencing periods of allocation during the quarter.  While the availability of 40nm products remained in tight supply throughout the quarter, 40nm process yield continued to improve.  As a result, 40nm revenues were up 178 percent over the prior quarter.
The desktop segment of our GPU business was up approximately 19 percent quarter over quarter, primarily due to increases in high-end and mainstream sales.  While channel inventories remained lean throughout the quarter, they recovered slightly to about five weeks of supply, up approximately one week from last quarters record low of four weeks.
The notebook segment of our GPU business was up approximately 27 percent quarter over quarter.  Notebook demand was particularly strong as our 40nm design wins on Calpella notebooks started to ramp.
Our MCP business represented 20 percent of total revenue and was down 19 percent sequentially.  Two main factors contributed to this decline: typical seasonality in the desktop channel, and inventory management ahead of a first quarter product transition.  We expect this business to be up in the first quarter as this product ramps.
Revenue for our Professional business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 16 percent of total revenue.   Our workstation business continued to experience strong recovery in demand with revenue up 25 percent sequentially.  Improved product mix helped lift ASPs and gross margins for this segment as well.   The computing segment of this business was down slightly quarter over quarter as customers anticipated the availability of our newest GPU computing architecture, called Fermi, which is currently in volume production and will commence shipping later this quarter.
Our Consumer and Other business, which includes cell phone products, as well as embedded entertainment, represented 5 percent of total revenue.
 
 
Gross Margin
 
GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 44.7 percent and was up 1.3 points sequentially.  Non-GAAP gross margin was also 44.7 percent and was up 4.0 points sequentially.  This was the fourth consecutive quarterly increase.  The major components of this 4.0 point increase are:
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $304.4 million, in line with guidance.  Sequentially, operating expenses were up $20.5 million, largely due to bring-ups of various new products, some salary reinstatements following company-wide reductions last year, and the fact that it was a 14 week quarter.
NVIDIAs worldwide employment at the end of the quarter stood at 5,706.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were down $22.9 million sequentially, notwithstanding $79.3 million of higher revenues.  DSO at quarter-end was 37 days, a 3-day improvement over the prior quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter, which amounted to $330.7 million, were 19 percent higher than the previous quarter.  Inventory days on hand at quarter-end was 60, versus 49 at the end of the third quarter.  Substantially all of the inventory increase in the fourth quarter related to 40nm products that we ramped to meet Q4 demand and position us for increased Q1 demand.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to approximately $47.9 million.  Capital expenditures were $22.6 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $69.2 million during the fourth quarter.  Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of $46.6 million was down from the prior quarter as a result of increased inventory and a higher than normal payout of certain accruals.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.73 billion, up approximately $94.1 million from the third quarter, with the principle contributors being cash earnings (net income after adding back non-cash expenses) less increases in working capital due to higher revenues and capital expenditures.
Reporting segments
Effective with the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we will no longer separate our MCP and GPU segments as such segmentation no longer reflects the way we manage these businesses.  As weve indicated previously, as a result of our on-going dispute with Intel over the terms of our cross licensing agreement we have ceased development of all future MCP products.  Furthermore, our MCP and GPU products serve the same customer needs, brands cross both segments and the teams now currently report into the same general manager.  We will, however, continue to give qualitative information about each segment.
 
 
 
First Quarter Outlook
 
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows:
We estimate stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter to be $25 million and depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures to be relatively flat when compared to the fourth quarter.
Diluted shares for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 591million.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation chips, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue related to a royalty dispute, a non-recurring restructuring charge against operating expenses, a non-recurring contract termination charge against operating expenses, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
 
Certain statements in this document including, but not limited to, statements as to: NVIDIAs financial projections for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; development of more efficient or faster technology; design, manufacturing or software defects; the impact of technological development and competition; changes in consumer preferences and demands; customer adoption of different standards or our competitor's products; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 25, 2009. Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on our website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 5, 2010, the Compensation Committee, or the Compensation Committee, of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation, or the Board of Directors, approved the Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2011 Plan, which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to certain officers, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors, or the Participants, as determined by our Compensation Committee, if certain pre-set corporate and/or individual targets are achieved during fiscal 2011. We operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends; e.g., fiscal 2011 refers to our fiscal year ending January 30, 2011.
Under the 2011 Plan, variable cash compensation will be paid to the Participants resulting from achievement of the corporate targets if we exceed pre-set threshold, target or maximum net income levels, determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, as set by our Compensation Committee and/or if individuals achieve their individual targets which are determined by our Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and based on individual rankings for managers and other qualifying senior contributors. Fifty percent (50%) of a Participants potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achiev ement of corporate targets (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participants corporate target award) and fifty percent (50%) will be allocated to the achievement of individual targets.
The achievement of individual targets is determined by our Compensation Committee in the case of the chief executive officer and the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and by the senior officer or director to whom a manager or senior contributor reports in the case of managers and senior contributors.
Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee reserve the right to:
           provide variable compensation to officers or employees other than under the 2011 Plan;
(i)
 
           modify compensation targets and criteria at any time or to grant variable cash compensation to the Participants; or
(ii)
         grant additional variable cash compensation to the Participants even if the performance targets are not met.
(iii)
The 2011 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2011 Plan.
 
Item 9.01 Exhibits.
(d)
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
Overview
 The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Certain Senior Officers, Directors and Managers (collectively, the Participants), each as defined below, who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2011 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the Committee), are employees of the Company on and as of the date the cash payments are awarded (each, a Variable Cash Payment), shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment fo r performance in fiscal year 2011 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets (the Corporate Targets) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below) and/or certain Individual Rankings (as defined below).
   
 For purposes of the Plan, only the Companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered Senior Officers, other employees at the level of vice president or director shall be considered Directors and managers or qualifying senior contributors shall be considered Managers. The Committee shall determine (i) the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan and the Senior Officers who may be Participants hereunder, (ii) the class of employees who may be designated by Senior Officers as Directors for purposes of this Plan and (iii) the class of employees who many be designated by Senior Officers or Directors as Ma nagers for purposes of this Plan.
   
 For fiscal year 2011, for purposes of the Plan, Individual Targets shall be set for certain Senior Officers and Directors as follows:
   
 For fiscal year 2011, for purposes of the Plan, Individual Rankings for Managers shall be the ranking of such Manager in January or February 2011 by the Senior Officer or Director to whom the Manager reports.
   
Determination of Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Cash Payments
 Certain Senior Officers and Directors are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or the Senior Officer or Director achieves his or her Individual Targets at specified levels. Managers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or based on the level of his or her Individual Ranking. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of the Corporate Targets and/or his or her Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (t he Variable Cash Payment Target Amount). A Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2011, each Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the Corporate Variable Cash Payment) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable (the Individual Variable Cash Payment). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Variable Cash Payment Target Amount as described more fully below.
   
 
 
 
 
Individual Variable Cash Payment
 An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or Individual Ranking, as applicable, or other criteria determined by the Committee.
   
 The actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2011 (the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved or the level of the Individual Ranking, as applicable, and the amount of the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment shall be determined as follows:
   
 An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, or in the case of a Manager who does not reach his or her Individual Ranking, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), Senior Officers (for Directors) or Senior Officers or Directors (for Managers who report to such Senior Officer or Director, as applicable), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Var iable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
   
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
 The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants, based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2011 net income. The amount of actual net income, as set forth in the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2011, as determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, shall be the Actual Result. The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2011 for Participants for the award of a portion or all of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the Threshold and Maximum, respectively). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2011 (the Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to t he following guidelines:
   
             Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    (Actual Result - Threshold) / (Corporate Target - Threshold) x (50% of Variable Cash Payment Target Amount)
   
 
             Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  = [1 + (() / (Maximum - Corporate Target))] x (50% of Variable Cash Payment Target Amount)
   
Actual Result - Corporate Target
 
 
 
 In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Payment.
   
 If a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
   
Miscellaneous Provisions
 Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
   
 Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Companys employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
   
 Notwithstanding whether this Plan is referenced in another agreement, policy, arrangement or other document, only the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Corporate Targets, Individual Targets and/or Individual Ranking and/or Corporate and/or Individual Variable Cash Payment amounts at any time.
   
 Any Variable Cash Payments or other benefits under this Plan shall be subject to the Companys Clawback Policy and shall bind all Participants subject to the Clawback Policy who receive any amounts under this Plan.
   
 This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

SANTA CLARA, Calif.May 13, 2010
 
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $137.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  That compares with $131.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the previous quarter and a net loss of $201.3 million, or $0.37 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
 
Gross margin increased to 45.6 percent for the first quarter fiscal 2011 from 44.7 percent in the previous quarter and 28.6 percent in the same period a year earlier.
 
 
With our new Fermi-class GPUs in full production, NVIDIAs key profit drivers are fully engaged, said Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA CEO and president and chief executive officer.  We shipped a few hundred thousand Fermi processors into strong consumer demand.  Our Quadro business for workstations grew strongly, fueled by pent up demand from enterprise customers and new growth markets like video editing.  And we had record revenue from Tesla processors for high-end servers.  We anticipate continued strength in these businesses over the coming quarters.

The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
 
Summary Results
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was just over $1.0 billion, up 2 percent from $982.5 million in the prior quarter.  Revenue was up 51 percent from that of a year ago.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 45.6 percent, which was up 90 basis points from the prior quarters gross margin of 44.7 percent.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $137.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income of $131.1 million, or $0.23 per share, in the prior quarter.
 
Revenue
As previously announced, our MCP (chipset) results are now reported as part of the GPU business.
*
 
Our GPU business, which includes discrete GPUs and chipsets for the desktop and notebook markets, was flat sequentially.  The mainstream segment of our desktop GPU business was down seasonally.  However, this effect was largely offset by the introduction and launch of our Fermi-based GeForce GTX470/480 GPUs, the launch of our GeForce GT320M chipset and strong notebook demand.  We successfully ramped GTX470/480, selling a few hundred thousand units by quarter end.  The launch of these GPUs puts NVIDIA back in the high end of the enthusiast segment of the market, which will be important to our earnings growth this year.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 19 percent of total revenue.   Demand for our workstation products continued to recover strongly.  Our computing business was also up significantly, achieving record levels following the launch of Tesla products based on our new Fermi architecture.  With Tesla, we now have business in the server segment of computing in addition to desktop, notebook and workstations.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes smartphone and tablet products, as well as embedded entertainment, represented 3 percent of total revenue.  The sequential decrease was due to seasonality in our game console business and other items.
 
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 45.6 percent.  Margins improved quarter over quarter primarily as a result of the launch of our Fermi-based high-end GPUs as well as strength in our Professional Solutions business, in which both our workstation and computing businesses have higher margins than our overall corporate average.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $309 million, up $4.5 million over the prior quarter.  Most of this increase was due to payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercises and RSU vesting, plus legal expenses incurred as we respond to inquiries associated with the Federal Trade Commission proceeding against Intel as well as our own litigation against Intel.  Legal expenses are expected to continue at this elevated level.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 9 percent, which was lower than anticipated as a result of various one-time discrete items.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $529.7 million, up $154.7 million sequentially.  Much of this increase was attributable to revenue from GeForce GTX 470/480 and GeForce GT320M which ramped very successfully late in the quarter.  Consequently our DSO at quarter-end was 48 days, up 11 days over the prior quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $388.1 million, up 17 percent over the prior quarter.  Inventory days on hand at quarter-end was 65, versus 60 at the end of the fourth quarter.  The increase was largely due to higher-than-expected yields of 40nm products.  In particular, good yields of GTX470 and GTX 480 meant we had insufficient back end capacity to assemble, test and ship these products before the end of the quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to approximately $47.1 million.  Capital expenditures were $17.1 million.
Cash flow used in operating activities was $5.4 million during the first quarter.  Free cash flow used in the first quarter was $22.5 million, with the principle contributors being additional working capital in accounts receivable and inventory offset by cash earnings (net income after adding back non-cash depreciation and stock based compensation).
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.76 billion, up approximately $36.7 million from the fourth quarter.
 
Second Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures to be relatively flat when compared to the first quarter.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 595million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation chips, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge rela ted to a tender offer purchase, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 
 
 
 
 
 
NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported revenue of $811.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 ended Aug. 1, 2010, down 19.0 percent from the prior quarter and up 4.5 percent from $776.5 million from the same period a year earlier.
SANTA CLARA, Calif.Aug. 12, 2010
 
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $141.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared with net income of $137.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the previous quarter and a net loss of $105.3 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period a year earlier.   GAAP gross margin was 16.6 percent compared with 45.6 percent in the previous quarter and 20.2 percent in the same period a year earlier.
 
 
Results were impacted by a large inventory write-down and a charge related to a weak die/packaging material set.
 
The inventory write-down was a consequence of weakened demand for consumer graphics processing units (GPUs) as higher memory prices and economic weakness in Europe and China led to a greater-than-expected shift to lower-priced GPUs and PCs with integrated graphics.
 
The weak die/packaging material set was used in certain versions of previous generation MCP (chipset) and GPU products shipped before July 2008 and used in notebook configurations.  The charge, of $193.9 million, includes additional remediation costs as well as the estimated costs of a pending settlement of a class action lawsuit consolidated in the District Court for the Northern District of California in April 2009 related to this same matter.  The settlement is subject to certain approvals, including final approval by the court.  Excluding this die/packaging material charge and the associated tax impact, non-GAAP net income was $20.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.
 
 Rapidly changing market conditions made for a challenging quarter, said Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's CEO and president. We delivered excellent results in Quadro professional graphics, Tesla GPU computing, and our Tegra system-on-a-chip business.  But our GeForce consumer business fell significantly short of expectations amid weak PC demand in Europe and China.  Although demand among end-users remains uncertain, we expect to drive revenue and grow market share with new products that are gaining momentum in each of our businesses.
 
Outlook
 
The outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows:

Non-GAAP Measures
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous gene ration MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $811.2 million, down 19.0 percent from $1.0 billion in the prior quarter.  Revenue was up 4.5 percent from that of a year ago.
Reflected in the second quarter results is a net charge of $193.9 million related to a previously disclosed weak die/packaging material set.  The second quarter results also include a large inventory write-down.  Each of these items is discussed in more detail below.  
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 16.6 percent, which was down 29.0 percentage points from the prior quarters gross margin of 45.6 percent.
GAAP net loss for the quarter was $141.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $137.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior quarter.
Excluding the charge for the weak die/packaging material set and the associated tax impact, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $20.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.
Revenue
Business conditions in the second quarter rapidly changed in our key segments and regions.  As we entered the second quarter, rising memory costs and the weakness of the Euro increased end market prices of graphics add-in cards.  In addition, the growing economic concerns in Europe and China began to create pressure on discretionary spending.  As a result, the market moved towards lower-cost GPUs and PCs with integrated graphics.   These issues disproportionately affected NVIDIA for two reasons.  Firstly, our product strategy is oriented more towards the higher-end of the market.  Secondly, our discrete GPU attach rates in Europe and China are the highest in the world, and our share in both those regions is very high.  As a result, we inevitably lost some s hare and missed our original revenue outlook.
In July, we launched our GeForce GTX 460 into the $199 to $249 segment.  It has sold well and continues to gain share.  The GeForce GTX 470 and GeForce GTX 480 continue to do well at the high-end.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 26.5 percent of total company revenue and was up 13.4 percent over the prior quarter.   Quadro professional graphics was up slightly and our computing business was up significantly, again setting a new record.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes smartphone and tablet products, as well as embedded entertainment, represented 5.6 percent of total revenue and was up 46.5 percent over the prior quarter.  Substantially all of this increase was attributable to Tegra, our mobile system on chip targeted for todays low power mobile applications.
Special Charge:
During the second quarter we recorded an additional net charge of $193.9 million related to a weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products shipped before July 2008 and used in notebook configurations.  The charge includes additional remediation costs as well as the estimated costs of a pending settlement of a class action lawsuit related to this matter.  Together with the $282.0 million of net charges we announced previously related to this same issue, this brings the total net charge to $475.9 million.
 
 
 
The extra remediation costs are primarily due to additional platforms from late failing systems that we had not previously considered to be at risk and, to a lesser extent, higher remediation costs per unit.  No new types of chips are involved.
 
Analysis of the anticipated costs is subject to many uncertainties but, two years after we shipped the last affected chip, data from customers indicates that the failure rates of most systems are decreasing.  Furthermore, we now test explicitly for this failure mode and have not seen any issues with the newer material sets.
Also during the second quarter, NVIDIA reached a settlement with the plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, consolidated in the District Court for the Northern District of California in April 2009, related to this same matter.  Part of the charge we took relates to the cost of implementing this settlement.  The settlement is subject to certain approvals, including final approval by the court.
Of the $193.9 million charge, $181.2 million was charged to cost of revenue and $12.7 million to SG&A.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 16.6 percent for the second quarter was unfavorably impacted by two significant events.  Firstly, GAAP gross profit was impacted by the aforementioned charge.    Secondly, the unexpected consumer PC market weakness resulted in excess inventory of certain, primarily older generation, products.  As a consequence, our second quarter results include charges for a large inventory write-down.
Excluding each of these items, gross margins would have exceeded our outlook.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $309.5 million.  However, this figure includes $12.7 million related to the weak die/packaging material charge.  Excluding this amount, non-GAAP operating expenses were $296.8 million, down $12.2 million over the prior quarter.  The underlying decrease was the result of cost reduction initiatives across the business rather than one single item.
Our tax provision for the quarter was a benefit of $28.1 million as a result of the reported GAAP net loss.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $395.9 million, down $133.7 million sequentially.  Most of this decrease was the result of the decrease in revenue compared to the prior quarter and strong collections performance.  Our DSO at quarter-end was 44 days, down 4 days relative to the prior quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $434.2 million, up 11.9 percent over the prior quarter.  Notwithstanding the inventory write-downs, inventory was up as a result of lower actual revenue than was planned early in the first quarter when we made wafer start commitments.  Our manufacturing cycle time is approximately four months.  We made appropriate adjustments to our build plans over the course of the second quarter, but we do not expect these corrections to meaningful impact our inventory levels until the fourth quarter.  Net of the inventory write-downs we took in the second quarter, we believe the inventory mix in our current pipeline is aligned with current market demand.
On a related note, channel inventory was down quarter-over-quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $46.6 million.  Stock-based compensation was $24.6 million.  Capital expenditures were $37.6 million.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $34.3 million during the second quarter.  Free cash flow used in the second quarter was slightly negative at $3.3 million with the principle contributors being strong collections offset by added inventory.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.77 billion, modestly up over the prior quarter.
 
 
 
Third Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be modestly up when compared to the second quarter.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million, primarily related to engineering software license renewals.
Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 586million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurr ing charge related to a tender offer purchase, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan
On May 5, 2010, the Compensation Committee, or the Compensation Committee, of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved the Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2011 Plan, which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to certain officers, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors, or the Participants, as determined by our Compensation Committee, if certain pre-set corporate and/or individual targets are achieved during fiscal 2011. We operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends; e.g., fiscal 2011 refers to our fiscal year ending January 30, 2011.
On September 7, 2010, the Compensation Committee amended the 2011 Plan in order to maintain Participant focus on corporate financial performance and to create incentives for the second half of fiscal 2011.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, variable cash compensation will be paid to the Participants resulting from our achievement of certain pre-set net income levels, determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, for the second half of fiscal 2011 as set by our Compensation Committee.  Variable cash compensation will also be paid if individuals achieve their individual targets which are determined by our Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and based on individual rankings for managers and other qualifying senior contributors.
In addition, in connection with our previously scheduled mid-year compensation review, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in the target variable compensation level that certain executive officers and employees may receive. 
  Originally, 50% of a Participants potential variable cash compensation was to be allocated to the achievement of corporate targets for all of fiscal 2011 (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participants corporate target award) and 50% was to be allocated to the achievement of individual targets.  As amended, 25% of a Participants potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achievement of revised corporate targets for only the second half of fiscal 2011, or the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount, (up to a maximum of 120% of the  Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount ) and 50% will still be allocated to the achievement of individual targets for the full fiscal year.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, the ability to achieve the Revised Corporate Pe rformance Target Amount  was reduced by one half (to 25% of the target) to reflect the elimination of corporate targets for the first half of fiscal 2011 from the 2011 Plan.
Originally, we needed to achieve a threshold level of net income before Participants would be eligible to receive that portion of variable compensation allocable to the achievement of the corporate target.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, a Participant is eligible to receive payout of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount on a straight line basis if we achieve net income between $0 and the pre-set target net income amount, or the Target Net Income Amount.   In addition, under the 2011 Plan, as amended, a Participant is eligible to receive payout of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount on a straight line basis if we achieve net income between the Target Net Income Amount and a pre-set maximum amount (up to a maximum of 120% of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount). Previously, t he payout for achieving the pre-determined maximum amount was set at 200%.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported revenue of $843.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended Oct. 31, 2010, up 4.0 percent from the prior quarter and down 6.6 percent from $903.2 million from the same period a year earlier.
SANTA CLARA, Calif.Nov. 11, 2010
 
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $84.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $141.0 million, or $0.25 per share, in the previous quarter and GAAP net income of $107.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.  GAAP gross margin was 46.5 percent compared with 16.6 percent in the previous quarter and 43.4 percent in the same period a year earlier.
 
 
 We have turned the corner, said Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIAs president and chief executive officer. We have restored our speed of execution and are regaining share in desktops.  Only seven months after shipping our first processor based on the Fermi architecture, we have begun production on seven more GPUs, including the GeForce GTX 580, which sets a new standard for performance.  The Fermi architecture is now in every segment of our desktop, notebook and workstation product lines.
 
Weve also made big strides this quarter in positioning ourselves at the center of cloud and mobile computing, which are transforming the computer landscape.  Tesla now powers some of the worlds fastest and greenest supercomputers.  And Tegra will soon be featured in a range of smartphones and tablets were building with our partners, he said.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous gene ration MCP and GPU products, net of
insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $843.9 million, up 4.0 percent from $811.2 million in the prior quarter.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 46.5 percent, up 29.9 percentage points from the prior quarters GAAP gross margin of 16.6 percent.  Excluding the effect of a charge for a weak die/packaging material set, non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 38.9 percent.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $84.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $141.0 million, or $0.25 per share, in the prior quarter. Excluding the weak/die packaging material set charge, and the associated tax impact, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $20.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.
Revenue
The business conditions that impacted our GPU business in the second quarter, namely rising memory costs and the weakness of the Euro, abated somewhat in the third quarter.  The third quarter GPU business also benefitted from the launch and ramp of our GeForce GTS 450 and GT 430 Fermi based GPUs aimed at the lower-priced segments of the add-in card market.  As a result, our GPU revenue was up 5.7 percent quarter-over-quarter and we gained some share in the desktop segment.  While we lost share in a significantly reduced notebook segment, we believe the market is stabilizing and we expect to regain share with the new notebook product cycle late in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of our fiscal 2012.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 24.9 percent of total company revenue and was down 2.3 percent from the prior quarter.   Quadro professional graphics was up but our computing business was down, the latter reflecting the influence a small number of large orders currently has on the computing business.  These quarterly variations will decrease as the computing business grows across more vertical segments.  Momentum is strong: this years GPU Technology Conference was the biggest ever, and the worlds fastest supercomputer, Chinas Tianhe-1A, is based on our Tesla products.
 
 
 
 
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra smartphone and tablet products, as well as embedded entertainment, represented 6.2 percent of total revenue and was up 13.6 percent over the prior quarter.  Significant Tegra shipments will continue to be gated by the production release of Android based smartphone and tablet products, which are expected to start ramping and shipping in volume in the fourth quarter.
 
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 46.5 percent for the third quarter was within guidance.  Mix was slightly less favorable than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $288.3 million, compared to GAAP operating expenses of $309.5 million for the second quarter, which included a $12.7 million charge related to the weak die/packaging material set.
Our tax provision for the quarter was $18.7 million, a tax rate of 18.1%.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $399.5 million, up $3.6 million sequentially.  Our DSO at quarter-end was 43 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $377.8 million, down 13.0 percent over the prior quarter.  The decrease was largely driven by higher third quarter revenues and actions taken to lower inventory levels.
On a related note, channel inventory was again slightly down quarter-over-quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $46.9 million.  Stock-based compensation was $25.2 million.  Capital expenditures were $21.8 million.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $212.2 million during the third quarter.  Free cash flow in the third quarter was $190.4 million with the principle contributors being cash earnings, earnings after adding back depreciation and stock-based compensation, and inventory reductions.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were a record $1.99 billion, up $214.7 million over the prior quarter.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization to be modestly up when compared to the third quarter.  Capital expenditures are expected to be under $50 million.
 
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 586million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurr ing charge related to a tender offer purchase, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the companys financial outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011; the market stabilization; regaining market share in the new notebook product cycle; our momentum; and factors affecting our Tegra shipments; are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; development of faster or more efficient technology; the impact of technological development and competition; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports  NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended August 1, 2010.  Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the companys website and are available from NVIDIA without charge.  These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

On January 10, 2011, NVIDIA Corporation and Intel Corporation entered into a patent cross license agreement and agreed to settle the litigation between them.
Patent Cross License Agreement
Under the patent cross license agreement, Intel has granted to NVIDIA and its qualified subsidiaries, and NVIDIA has granted to Intel and Intel's qualified subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license, without the right to sublicense to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first filing date on or before March 31, 2017, to make, have made (subject to certain limitations), use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. NVIDIA's rights to Intel's patents have certain specified limitations, including but not limited to, NVIDIA is not licensed to: (1) certain microprocessors, defined in the agreement as "Intel Processors" or "Intel Compatible Processors;" (2) certain chipsets that connect to Intel Processors; and (3) certain flash memory products. Subject to the terms and conditions of the patent cross license agreement, Intel will pay NVIDIA licensing fees which in the aggregate will amount to $1.5 billion, payable in annual installments, as follows: a $300 million payment on each of January 18, 2011, January 13, 2012 and January 15, 2013 and a $200 million payment on each of January 15, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The term of the patent cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. NVIDIA may terminate the patent cross license agreement if Intel fails to make the required payments under the patent cross license agreement and fails to cure such non-payment within 60 days. In addition, the patent cross license agreement may be terminated in whole or in part under certain circumstances with respect to a party, if such party declares bankruptcy or undergoes a change of control.
The foregoing description of the patent cross license agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the patent cross license agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Litigation with Intel Corporation
On February 17, 2009, Intel filed suit against NVIDIA, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief relating to a license agreement that the parties signed in 2004. The lawsuit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court. Intel sought an order from the Court declaring that the license does not extend to certain NVIDIA chipset products and enjoining NVIDIA from stating that it has license rights for these products. The lawsuit sought no damages from NVIDIA.
On March 23, 2009, NVIDIA filed its answer to Intel's complaint and also asserted counterclaims for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. NVIDIA's counterclaims sought an order declaring that NVIDIA has the right to sell certain chipset products with Intel's processors under the 2004 license agreement, and enjoining Intel from interfering with our license rights. In addition, the counterclaims sought a finding that Intel had materially breached its obligations under a prior license agreement, and requested various remedies for that breach, including termination of Intel's cross licensing rights and damages. On April 16, 2009, Intel filed its answer to our counterclaims.
As described above, on January 10, 2011, NVIDIA and Intel entered into a patent cross license agreement. Pursuant to this patent cross license agreement, NVIDIA and Intel also agreed to dismiss the Delaware litigation, and each company gave the other a general release for all claims that it might have against the other, known or unknown, based on the actions of either company on or before the date of the settlement.

The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $886.4 million, up 5.0 percent from $843.9 million in the prior quarter.  Revenue was at the very top end of our expectations. We believe some analyst estimates may have recorded the Intel settlement as revenue, rather than as a credit to operating expenses, artificially raising revenue consensus.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was a record 48.1 percent, up 1.6 percentage points from the prior quarters GAAP gross margin of 46.5 percent.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $171.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared with $84.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter results include a benefit to operating expenses of $57.0 million, $37.1 million after tax, as a result of a legal settlement entered into in connection with a new licensing agreement with Intel.
Revenue
 
Our GeForce GPU business continues to improve.  Revenue from discrete GPUs was particularly strong throughout the quarter with both desktop and notebook demand up from the prior period as GeForce gained share.  Desktop demand was particularly strong in our high end products following the launches of the GeForce GTX 580, GTX 570 and GTX 560.   Channel inventory decreased slightly, and remains comfortably within our target levels.  Notebook demand was also strong with GeForce GT 540M and the launch of GeForce GT 520M.  The latter is designed to enable OEMs to up sell premium models that use Intels Sandy Bridge integrated graphics.  We still expect to gain notebook discrete share when Intel resumes shipments of its Sandy Bridge chipset.   Integrated graphics (MCP) shipments fell sharply this quarter as expected.  We expect our integrated graphics business to continue to decline through the year.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was down 3.1 percent from the prior quarter. Tesla was strong, and significantly up from the third quarter.  Revenue in our Quadro professional graphics business was down modestly from the third quarter due to delays at certain customers as they transitioned to our new series of professional products based on Fermi.  We expect Quadro to pick back up in the first quarter.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra smartphone and tablet products, as well as embedded entertainment, was also up over the prior quarter as several Tegra customers have started their production ramps.  We expect shipments to ramp aggressively in the coming quarters as our Tegra customers enter production with their smartphones and tablets.
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 48.1 percent for the fourth quarter was above our estimates and grew largely through a richer overall revenue mix, particularly in desktop GPU.
 
 
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which includes a $57.0 million benefit from the legal settlement with Intel, were $246.6 million, compared to GAAP operating expenses of $288.3 million for the third quarter.  Excluding this item, expenses were in line with our expectations.
Our tax provision for the quarter was $14.3 million, a tax rate of 7.7%. This includes the full-year benefits of the retroactive reenactment of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, $13.7 million of which applies to prior quarters.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $348.8 million, down $50.7 million sequentially.  Our DSO at quarter-end was 36 days, down 7 days from the prior quarter.  Strong collections and improved shipment linearity each contributed to this improvement.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $345.5 million, down 8.5 percent from the prior quarter.  The decrease was largely driven by conscientious actions taken to lower inventory levels from those we previously reported in the second and third quarters.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $46.4 million.  Stock-based compensation was $25.4 million.  Capital expenditures were $21.3 million.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $434.7 million during the fourth quarter.  Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $413.3 million with the principle contributors being the receipt of Intels first licensing payment of $300.0 million, cash earnings and lowered working capital.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.49 billion, up $503.3 million over the prior quarter.
Accounting for the Intel License Agreement
Payments to NVIDIA under the licensing agreement we entered into with Intel amounts to $1.5 billion over five years.  These payments under the agreement will be accounted for in three separate pieces:
Note that recognition of items 2 and 3 above will commence in April 2011 when the terms of the license take effect.  Consequently, our first quarter results and outlook will only include one month of licensing revenue and costs, approximately $22.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
First Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the first quarter to be approximately $46 million.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 to $35 million.
Diluted shares for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 621million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation MCP and GPU pr oducts, net of insurance reimbursements, a non-recurring charge related to a tender offer purchase, a non-recurring benefit from a legal settlement, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the companys financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012; improvements in GPU business; expectations with respect to future gains in notebook discrete share; anticipated decline in the companys integrated graphics business; expectations with respect to the Quadro professional graphics business in the first quarter of fiscal 2012; and expected ramp in the companys consumer products business as Tegra customers enter production are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; development of faster or more efficient technology; the impact of technological development and competition; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports  NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 31, 2010.  Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the companys website and are available from NVIDIA without charge.  These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forwar d-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Dear David:
This letter is the transition and consulting agreement (the "Agreement") between you and NVIDIA Corporation (the "Company").
1. R T.
ESIGNATION
AND
RANSITION
. You hereby resign from your position as Chief Financial Officer, effective as of March 17, 2011 ("Resignation Date"). In order to assist the Company with a smooth transition after the Resignation Date, you will continue to remain employed by the Company (and the Company will continue to pay you your current monthly base salary) until your employment ends on May 31, 2011 (the "Transition Date"). On the Transition Date, the Company will pay you all accrued salary earned through the Transition Date, subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings, which you are entitled to regardless of whether or not you sign this Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Company's Fiscal 2011 Variable Compensation Plan, as amended, which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to certain officers, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors upon the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals for the fiscal year from February 1, 2010 to January 30, 2011, you will receive $259,875 on March 31, 2011, which is the same day the other participants under the plan will receive their incentive payments.
(a) Resignation and Resignation Date
. Between the Resignation Date and the Transition Date (the "Transition Period"), you will make yourself available to perform your assigned duties and responsibilities. During the Transition Period, you will continue to abide by all of your contractual and legal obligations to the Company, and will continue to abide by the Company's policies and procedures.
(b) Transition Period
. If you execute this Agreement and comply with its terms, and reconfirm your release of claims by executing the Transition Date Release attached as hereto on or within 21 days after the Transition Date and allowing it to become effective in accordance with its terms, the Company will pay you a lump sum payment of $128,333.34, subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings, on the 30
(c) Transition Payment
Exhibit A
th
day following the Transition Date (the "Transition Payment"). It is intended that each payment under this Agreement (i) be regarded as a separate "payment" for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(i) and (ii) be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and be implemented and construed in accordance therewith to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law.
Subject to your election of continued medical insurance coverage in accordance with the applicable provisions of state and federal law (commonly referred to as "COBRA"), as part of this Agreement, and subject to the effectiveness of the Transition Date Release, the Company shall pay to you, on the first day of each month after the Transition Date, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the applicable COBRA premiums for that month (including premiums for you and your eligible dependents who have elected and remain enrolled in such

COBRA coverage), subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the "Special Cash Payment"), for a number of months equal to the lesser of (i) the duration of the period in which you and your eligible dependents are enrolled in such COBRA coverage (and not otherwise covered by another employer's group health plan) and (ii) eighteen (18) months. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Cash Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. In the event you become covered under another employer's group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this paragraph, you must immediately notify the Company of such event and the Company shall cease payment of the Special Cash Payments.
To further support transition, the Company will retain you as a consultant under the terms specified below if you execute this Agreement, comply with its terms, reconfirm your release of claims by executing the Transition Date Release attached as Exhibit A hereto on or within 21 days after the Transition Date, and allow it to become effective in accordance with its terms.
2. C A.
ONSULTING
GREEMENT
The consulting relationship commences on the Transition Date (without any disruption in your status as a service provider) and continues until August 31, 2011, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Paragraph 2(h) below or extended by agreement of you and the Company (the "Consulting Period"). Any agreement to extend the Consulting Period after August 31, 2011 must be set forth in a writing signed by you and the CEO of the Company.
(a) Consulting Period.
You agree to provide consulting services to the Company in any area of your expertise, including but not limited to generally supporting finance and accounting activities, supporting the transition of responsibilities to the interim CFO and full-time CFO, when hired, and being available for questions and issues that arise related to the fiscal 2012 financial plan, the closing of fiscal quarters and tax, facilities and IT matters (the "Consulting Services"). During the Consulting Period, you will report directly to the CEO or as otherwise specified by the CEO. You agree to exercise the highest degree of professionalism and utilize your expertise and creative talents in performing these services. You agree to make yourself available to perform such consulting services throughout the Consulting Period, up to a maximum of twenty (20) hours per week. You will not be required to report to the Company's offices during the Consulting Period, except as specifically requested by the Company.
(b) Consulting Services.
Your relationship with the Company during the Consulting Period will be that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or should be construed to, create a partnership, agency, joint venture or employment relationship after the Transition Date. You will not be entitled to any of the benefits which the Company may make available to its employees, including but not limited to, group health or life insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits.
(c) Independent Contractor Relationship.
During the Consulting Period, and provided that you remain in compliance with this Agreement, you will receive as consulting fees $35,416.66 per month ("Consulting Fees"). Because you will be providing the Consulting Services as an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold any amount for taxes, social security or other payroll deductions from the Consulting Fees. The Company will report the Consulting Fees on an IRS Form 1099. You acknowledge that you will be entirely responsible for payment of any taxes that may be due on the Consulting Fees, and you hereby indemnify, defend and save harmless the Company, and its officers and directors in their individual capacities, from any liability for any taxes, penalties or interest that may be assessed by any taxing authority with respect to the Consulting Fees, with the exception of the employer's share of social security, if any, which will be paid by the Company. The Consulting Fees will be paid on the

You will have no authority to bind the Company to any contractual obligations, whether written, oral or implied, except with the written authorization of the CEO. You agree not to represent or purport to represent the Company in any manner whatsoever to any third party unless authorized by the Company, in writing, to do so.
(e) Limitations on Authority
You agree that, during the Consulting Period and thereafter, you will not use or disclose any confidential or proprietary information or materials of the Company, including any confidential or proprietary information that you obtain or develop in the course of performing the Consulting Services. Any and all work product you create in the course of performing the Consulting Services will be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. You hereby assign to the Company all right, title, and interest in all inventions, techniques, processes, materials, and other intellectual property developed in the course of performing the Consulting Services. You further acknowledge and reaffirm your continuing obligations under the Employee Confidentiality and Inventions Assignment Agreement entered into between you and the Company (the "Confidential Information Agreement," a copy of which has been provided to you and is incorporated herein by reference).
(f) Confidential Information and Inventions.
Throughout the Consulting Period, you retain the right to engage in employment, consulting, or other work relationships in addition to your work for the Company. The Company will make reasonable arrangements to enable you to perform your work for the Company at such times and in such a manner so that it will not interfere with other activities in which you may engage. In order to protect the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of the Company, you agree that, during the Consulting Period, you will notify the Company, in writing, before you obtain employment with or perform competitive work for any business entity, or engage in any other work activity that is competitive with the Company. If you engage in such competitive activity without the Company's express written consent, or otherwise materially breach this Agreement, then (in addition to any other rights and remedies available to the Company at law, in equity or by contract), the Company's obligation to pay you Consulting Fees (as defined below) will cease immediately.
(g) Other Work Activities.
Without waiving any other rights or remedies, the Company may terminate immediately the Consulting Period and its corresponding obligation to pay you Consulting Fees upon your breach of any provision of this Agreement. Further, you may terminate the Consulting Period at any time, for any reason, upon written notice to the Company, which termination shall extinguish the Company's obligation to pay you any further Consulting Fees. Upon termination of the Consulting Period by either party, the Company will pay only those Consulting Fees earned and expenses incurred through and including the effective date of such termination.
(h) Termination of Consulting Period.
You currently have options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock (the "Options") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") pursuant to the Company's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan (and your award agreements), vesting of the Options and RSUs will continue during the Transition Period and the Consulting Period based on your Continuous Service (as defined in the Plan) and will cease as of the end of the Consulting Period. Your rights to exercise your vested Options will be as set forth in the Plan. Your unvested RSUs will expire upon the termination of your

Fifty percent (50%) of a Participants potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achievement of corporate targets (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participants corporate target award) and fifty percent (50%) will be allocated to the achievement of individual targets (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participant ;s individual target award).

Overview
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Certain Senior Officers, as defined below (collectively, the Participants), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2012 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the Committee), are employees of the Company on and as of the date the cash payments are awarded (each, a Variable Cash Payment), shall be eligible to participate in the Fiscal Year 2012 Variable Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment for performance in fiscal year 2012 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate perfor mance targets (the Corporate Targets) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below). Payments awarded in connection with the achievement of Corporate Targets shall be referred to herein as a Corporate Variable Cash Payment and payments awarded in connection with the achievement of Individual Targets shall be referred to herein as an Individual Variable Cash Payment.
For purposes of the Plan, only the Companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered Senior Officers.  The Committee shall determine the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan and the Senior Officers who may be Participants hereunder.
For fiscal year 2012, for purposes of the Plan, Individual Targets shall be set for certain Senior Officers as follows:
Determination of Fiscal Year 2012 Variable Cash Payments
Certain Senior Officers are eligible to receive a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or such Senior Officer achieves his or her Individual Targets at specified levels. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may receive upon achievement of the Corporate Targets and/or his or her Individual Targets and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer (the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount). A Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2012, each Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (5 0%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of his or her Individual Targets (the Individual Variable Cash Target Amount). A Participant may be eligible to receive more or less than his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount or Individual Variable Cash Target Amount as described more fully below.
Individual Variable Cash Payment
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or other criteria determined by the Committee.
The amount of the actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2012 (the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved:
 
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, the Participant may still be eligible to receive an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not receive an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
 
 
 
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2012 net income. The amount of actual net income, as set forth in the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2012 as may be adjusted for material non-recurring items at the discretion of the Committee, shall be the Actual Result. The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2012 for Participants for the award of a portion or all of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the Threshold and Maximum, respectively). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2012 (the Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines:
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [(((Actual Result  Threshold) / (Corporate Target  Threshold)) / 2) + 50%] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [((Actual Result  Corporate Target) / (Maximum - Corporate Target)) + 1] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
In no event shall any Participant receive an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount.
If a Participant does not receive a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to receive all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
Miscellaneous Provisions
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Companys employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
Notwithstanding whether this Plan is referenced in another agreement, policy, arrangement or other document, only the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time. Further, the Board of Directors or the Committee may modify the Corporate Targets, Individual Targets and/or Corporate and/or Individual Variable Cash Target amounts at any time.
Any Variable Cash Payments or other benefits under this Plan shall be subject to the Companys Clawback Policy and shall bind all Participants subject to the Clawback Policy who receive any amounts under this Plan.
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue of $962.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended May 1, 2011, up 8.5 percent from the prior quarter, and down 4.0 percent from $1.0 billion from the same period a year earlier.
SANTA CLARA, Calif.May 12, 2011
 
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $135.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.  That compares with net income of $171.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the previous quarter, which included a $57.0 million credit to operating expenses related to the legal settlement in connection with a new Intel licensing agreement. In the same period a year earlier, the company had net income of $137.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $165.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. That compares with non-GAAP net income of $142.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, and $169.0 million, $0.29 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.
 
GAAP gross margin was 50.4 percent, a third consecutive record, compared with 48.1 percent in the previous quarter and 45.6 percent in the same period a year earlier.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 50.6 percent, compared with 48.3 percent in the prior quarter and 45.7 percent in the same period a year earlier.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our core GPU businesses are solid, with expanding revenues and margins.  And this quarter, our Tegra mobile business took off, said Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA president and chief executive officer.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax expense, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, other acquisition related costs, a non-recurring benefit from a legal settlement, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Revenue
Our GPU business remained strong throughout the first quarter of 2012, up 3.8% from the previous quarter.  This was primarily related to the strength of our discrete GPUs for notebook.  Desktop GPUs, although down seasonally, outperformed our expectations top to bottom, with the market responding favorably to the launch of our new GPUs.  Channel inventory remains comfortably within our target levels.  Demand for notebook GPUs increased significantly and, as OEMs ramped production of Sandy Bridge notebooks, the breadth of our wins on that platform started to become apparent.
The increased demand in our notebook business was more than able to offset the expected decline in our integrated graphics (MCP) business as we end of life these products.
Our patent cross license agreement with Intel also contributed to the strength in our GPU business, with one months worth of revenue recognized in the first quarter.
 
 
 
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was relatively flat from the prior quarter.  Our Quadro professional graphics business increased sequentially.  However, revenue from our Tesla business was down relative to the prior quarter, as the fourth quarter benefited from a particular large transaction.  As this business matures, we expect to see more steady growth quarter over quarter.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra smart phone and tablet products, as well as our embedded products, was up significantly over the prior quarter, reaching record revenue of $122.6 million, up 78.2% from the prior quarter.  This increase was due to several of our Tegra customers bringing their first Android products to the market.
TM
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 50.4 percent for the first quarter was above our estimates largely through a richer overall revenue mix, primarily attributable to the strength of desktop GPU and Tegra and the addition of revenue from the new Intel license agreement.  Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 50.6 percent.
 
 
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $329.6 million, compared to GAAP operating expenses of $246.6 million in the prior quarter, which included a $57.0 million benefit from the legal settlement with Intel.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $296.8 million in the first quarter, compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $277.6 million in the prior quarter.  Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
The increase in non-GAAP expenses in the first quarter over the prior quarter largely related to increased employee compensation, primarily due to additional headcount for our strategic initiatives, including Tegra, and the full quarter reinstatement of U.S. payroll taxes.
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $21.3 million, a tax rate of 13.6%.  Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other acquisition related costs was $26.1 million or 13.6%.
Balance Sheet
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $343.2 million, down $5.6 million sequentially.  Our DSO at quarter-end was 33 days, down 3 days from 36 days in the prior quarter.  Strong collections and improved shipment linearity each contributed to this improvement.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $381.0 million, up 10.3 percent from $345.5 million in the prior quarter.  The increase was largely driven by conscientious actions to meet anticipated demand for our products.
 
 
 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter amounted to $47.8 million.  Capital expenditures and intangible asset purchases were $31.2million.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.73 billion, up $236 million over the prior quarter.
Icera
We expect the acquisition of Icera to close toward the end of May or the beginning of June. As a result, the second quarter is expected to include approximately two months of Iceras operating results.
Second Quarter Outlook
Excluding the Icera acquisition, our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $51 million.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $35 to $40 million.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 617million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax expense, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, other acquisition related costs, a non-recurring benefit from a legal settlement, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; development of faster or more efficient technology; the impact of technological development and competition; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; the timing of the closing of our acquisition of Icera; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports  NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2011.

Amendment to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
On May 18, 2011, at the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of NVIDIA Corporation, or the 2011 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Amendment, to declassify the Board of Directors and provide for the annual election of all directors. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 23, 2011 and was effective as of such date. Pursuant to the Amendment, directors who have been elected to three-year terms prior to the filing of the Amendment (including directors elected at the 2011 Annual Meeting) will complete those terms. Thereafter, their successors will be elected to one-year terms and from and after the 2014 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of NVIDIA Corporation, all directors will stand for election annually. The Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Amended and Restated Bylaws
Our Board of Directors previously approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Bylaws to eliminate the Board of Directors' classified structure in the same manner as the Amendment, which became effective upon the filing of the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 23, 2011. The Amended and Restated Bylaws are filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the 2011 Annual Meeting, the following proposals were adopted by the margin indicated. Proxies for the 2011 Annual Meeting were solicited pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and there was no solicitation in opposition of management's solicitation.

(f)
In order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules
(g)
 
and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to proposals and/or nominations to be considered pursuant to Section 5(a)(iii) of these Bylaws.

(a)
 Stockholders shall not be permitted to propose business to be brought before a special meeting of stockholders and the only matters that may be brought before a special meeting are the matters specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the person calling the meeting. The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting. Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.
(b)
 Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in these Bylaws who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i); provided, that if such nominee(s) are proposed on behalf of a beneficial owner such nominations may only be properly brought before the meeting, if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the corporation at the time of the giving of the stockholder's notice set forth in this paragraph. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 5(b)(i) of these Bylaws shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such information as required under Section 5(c). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

 At any meeting of stockholders for the election of one or more directors at which a quorum is present, each such director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director, provided that if the number of nominees at such meeting, determined at any time, including as of the record date for such meeting, exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on such committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.

Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue. Each certificate shall state upon the face or back thereof, in full or in summary, all of the powers, designations, preferences, and rights, and the limitations or restrictions of the shares authorized to be issued or shall, except as otherwise required by law, set forth on the face or back a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required by the DGCL or a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating,

optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
A new certificate or certificates shall be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and on such terms and conditions as the corporation may require. The corporation may require, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or the owner's legal representative, to agree to indemnify the corporation in such manner as it shall require or to give the corporation a surety bond in such form and amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

(a)
 Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions and proper evidence of compliance of other conditions of applicable law, by contract or otherwise to rightful transfer from the registered owner of the uncertificated or certificated shares, such uncertificated or certificated shares, as applicable, shall be cancelled and issuance of new equivalent uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the person entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded upon the books of the corporation.

Section 38. Fixing Record Dates.
 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, subject to applicable law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(a)
provided, however,
 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(b)
 
The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Section 39. Registered Stockholders.
All bonds, debentures and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock certificates (covered in Section 35), may be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, and the corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature, or where permissible facsimile signature, of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signatures of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.
Section 40. Execution of Other Securities.
provided, however,
No contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers, are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorized the contract or transaction or solely because any such director's or officer's votes are counted for such purposes, if:
Section 41. Transactions with Interested Parties.
 the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(a)
 the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or
(b)
 the contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders.
(c)
 
. Interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee thereof, which authorizes the contract or transaction.
Section 42. Quorum
Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to law at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
Section 43. Declaration of Dividends.
Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
Section 44. Dividend Reserve.
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 45. Fiscal Year.
Section 46. Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents.
The corporation shall indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XII, "executive officers" shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law; that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive officers.
(a) Directors and Executive Officers.
provided, however,
The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person (other than as specified in clause (a) above) to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
(b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents.
The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding; that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director
c) Expenses.
provided, however,
 
or an executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or an executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 46, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of any undertaking, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
(d) Enforcement.
The rights conferred on any person by this Section 46 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.
(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights.
 
The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(f) Survival of Rights.
To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, or any other applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 46.
(g) Insurance.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 46 that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
(h) Amendments.
If this Section 46 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Section 46 that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section 46 shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.
(i) Saving Clause.
For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following definitions shall apply:
(j) Certain Definitions.

(3)
 References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as, respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

Section 47. Notices.
 Notice to stockholders of stockholder meetings shall be given as provided in Section 7 herein. Without limiting the manner by which notice may otherwise be given effectively to stockholders under any agreement or contract with such stockholder, and except as otherwise required by law, notice to stockholders for purposes other than stockholder meetings may be sent by US mail or nationally recognized overnight courier, or by facsimile, telegraph or telex or by electronic mail or other electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.
(a) Notice to Stockholders.
Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by overnight delivery service, facsimile, telex or telegram, except that such notice other than one which is delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director.
(b) Notice to Directors.
An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, or other agent, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained.
(c) Affidavit of Mailing.
All notices given by mail or by overnight delivery service, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing, and all notices given by facsimile, telex or telegram or by electronic mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to have been given as of the sending time recorded at time of transmission.
(d) Time Notices Deemed Given.
The period or limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such director to receive such notice.
(e) Failure to Receive Notice.
It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all recipients of notice, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
(f) Methods of Notice.
Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
(g) Notice to Person with Whom Communication Is Unlawful.
 
Except as otherwise prohibited under DGCL, any notice given under the provisions of DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Such consent shall have been deemed to have been given if such stockholder fails to object in writing to the corporation within sixty (60) days of having been given notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice. Any consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue of $1.02 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 ended July 31, 2011, up 5.7 percent from the prior quarter, and up  25.3 percent from $811.2 million in the same period a year earlier.
SANTA CLARA, Calif.Aug. 11, 2011
 
 
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  This includes a two-cent dilutive impact from the Icera acquisition.  It compares with net income of $135.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the prior quarter. In the same period a year earlier, the company had a net loss of $141.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share.
 
On a non-GAAP basis  which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition related costs, and the tax impact associated with these items  net income was $193.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. That compares with net income of $165.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, and net income of $47.6 million, $0.08 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
 
GAAP gross margin was 51.7 percent, a fourth consecutive record, compared with 50.4 percent in the previous quarter and 16.6 percent in the same period a year earlier.  Non-GAAP gross margin, at 51.9 percent, was also a record, and compares with 50.6 percent in the prior quarter and 39.2 percent in the same period a year earlier.
 
 
 
 
 
We grew solidly this quarter, said Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA president and chief executive officer. Consumer demand for notebooks powered by our GeForce GPU, with its unique Optimus technology, resulted in record revenue for these products.
 
The future of computing is mobile and visual. With Tegras momentum and our growing GPU businesses, we are ideally positioned to lead the industry forward, he said.
 
Outlook
 
Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $53 million to $57 million.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $25 to $35 million.
Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 615 million.
 
Note: this outlook now includes Icera.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of NVIDIAs previous generation MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
 
GAAP earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.25 per diluted share.  The effect of the Icera acquisition, including its results of operations and all acquisition-related costs was ($0.02) per diluted share.  Consequently, net of the Icera acquisition, which was excluded from our outlook, we achieved the high end of our outlook range for the quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.32 per diluted share.  This excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the tax impact associated with these items.
Revenue for the second quarter was $1.02 billion, up 5.7 percent from $962.0 million in the prior quarter.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was a record 51.7 percent, up 1.3 percentage points from the prior quarters GAAP gross margin of 50.4 percent.  This is the fourth consecutive record quarter.  Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 51.9 percent, compared to 50.6 percent in the prior quarter.
GAAP operating expenses were $351.3 million.  Of this, the acquisition and operating expenses relating to Icera totaled $17.3 million.  Net of Icera, operating expenses were in line with the outlook given when we reported our first quarter results, which excluded these costs.   Non-GAAP operating expenses were $306.0 million.
GAAP net income for the second quarter was $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $135.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the prior quarter.  Non-GAAP net income was $193.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $165.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the prior quarter.
 
 
 
 
Revenue
Our Consumer Products Business now includes Icera.
(1)
Our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, memory, MCP products and licensing revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel, was relatively flat compared with the previous quarter.  Desktop GPU revenue declined in the quarter in line with typical seasonality, while notebook GPU revenue increased as we continued to gain significant market share on the Intel Sandy Bridge platform.  Channel inventory declined slightly in the quarter and remained comfortably within our target levels.
Our MCP revenue continued to decline as predicted, as we end-of-life these products, and is expected to decline significantly in the third quarter.
This was the first full quarter for our patent cross license agreement with Intel, with $65.9 million of revenue recognized in the second quarter.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was up 4.2 percent from the prior quarter.  Our Quadro professional graphics business increased sequentially as we saw a pick-up in enterprise IT spending and as we continued our transition to Fermi-generation products.  Revenue from our Tesla business was flat relative to the prior quarter.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra smart phone and tablet products, and now Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, as well as our embedded products, was up 36.8 percent over the prior quarter, at $167.7 million.  Much of the increase was driven by seasonally up game console royalties and refreshes in embedded entertainment products.   Tegra was steady as the product ramps in the first quarter hit shelves.  Iceras contribution was not significant.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 51.7 percent for the second quarter was above our estimates largely through a more favorable product mix in our GPU and PSB businesses than we had anticipated. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 51.9 percent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Expenses and Other
 
GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $351.3 million, compared to GAAP operating expenses of $329.6 million in the prior quarter.  As explained, GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter include a total of $17.3 million of Icera costs, for its on-going operations, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs.  Consequently, our operating expenses were in line with the outlook given when we reported the first quarter results, which explicitly excluded these costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $306.0 million in the second quarter, compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $296.8 million in the prior quarter.  The increase was almost entirely due to including Icera operating costs, with also a small planned contribution from hiring into our strategic businesses.  Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $26.0 million, an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, was $32.0 million or an effective tax rate of 14.2 percent.
Balance Sheet
 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.47 billion, down $252.0 million over the prior quarter due primarily to the purchase of Icera for approximately $352.2 million, partially offset by cash flow from operating activities of $82.0 million.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $419.9 million, up $76.7 million sequentially.  Our DSO at quarter-end was 38 days, up 5 days from 33 days in the prior quarter, but still below our company average, and within a healthy level.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $361.9 million, down 5.0 percent from $381.0 million in the prior quarter, as we actively managed production builds throughout the quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $52.2 million.  Capital expenditures were $23.3 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $82.0 million in the second quarter, compared to $172.2 million in the prior quarter.  The decrease quarter over quarter is primarily attributable to an increase in our net income offset by a combination of an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable that related to an additional pay cycle in the second quarter versus the prior quarter.
 
 
Third Quarter Outlook
 
Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, which now includes Icera, is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the third quarter to be approximately $53 million to $57 million.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $25 to $35 million.
Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 615million.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIAs Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share.  In order for NVIDIAs investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of the NVIDIAs previous generation MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.  NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the companys historical financial performance. The presentation of the companys non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the companys financial outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012; improvements in GPU business; expectations with respect to future gains in notebook discrete share; anticipated decline in the companys MCP business; expectations with respect to the GPU desktop and Quadro professional graphics businesses in the third quarter of fiscal 2012; the companys strategic investments in the mobile space; and expected ramp in the companys consumer products business as Tegra customers enter production are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners products;  design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports  NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended May 1, 2011.   Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the companys website and are available from NVIDIA without charge.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Reports Financial Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012
SANTA CLARA, Calif.-Nov. 10, 2011-
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue of $1.07 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 ended Oct. 30, 2011, up 4.9 percent from the prior quarter, and up 26.3 percent from $843.9 million in the same period a year earlier.
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $178.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. That compares with net income of $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the prior quarter and $84.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.
On a non-GAAP basis - which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition related costs, and the tax impact associated with these items - net income was $217.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. That compares with net income of $193.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, and net income of $117.4 million, $0.20 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
GAAP gross margin was 52.2 percent, a fifth consecutive record, compared with 51.7 percent in the previous quarter and 46.5 percent in the same period a year earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin, at 52.5 percent, was also a record, and compares with 51.9 percent in the prior quarter and 46.8 percent in the same period a year earlier.
NVIDIA's strategy is coming into its own, as the world becomes increasingly visual and mobile, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive of NVIDIA. Our GPU business accelerated in the third quarter, driven by strong demand from gamers and the professional market. And our mobile business benefited from new devices coming onto the market. With Tegra 3 phone wins well ahead of Tegra 2's pace, we're expecting strong growth in the year ahead.
Outlook
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter to be approximately $53 million to $57 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 to $40 million.
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 618 million.

CFO Commentary on Third Quarter FY2012 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
GAAP earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.29 per diluted share.
Non-GAAP earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.35 per diluted share. This excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the tax impact associated with these items.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings both exceeded expectations for the quarter.
Revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, up 4.9 percent from $1.02 billion in the prior quarter.
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 52.2 percent, up 0.5 percentage points from the prior quarter's GAAP gross margin of 51.7 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 52.5 percent, compared with 51.9 percent in the prior quarter, up 0.6 percentage points. This is the fifth consecutive quarter for record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins.
GAAP operating expenses were $359.6 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $317.6 million, both slightly lower than our estimates. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs.
GAAP net income for the third quarter was $178.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared with $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $217.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $193.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the prior quarter. Our GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income grew 17.6 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, over the prior quarter.
 
Revenue
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, MCP products and license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel - was up 1.0 percent compared with the previous quarter, at $644.8 million. This is despite the continued downward pressure on our revenue as we end-of-life our MCP products. MCP revenue declined $47.3 million to $22.4 million in the third quarter.
The strength in our GPU business in the third quarter was largely attributable to our desktop GPU products, with revenue increasing 23.0 percent over the prior quarter. This was not only due to seasonal strength for desktop GPU in the third quarter, but also the increased demand for our high-end products as consumers geared-up their PCs for new titles such as Battlefield 3, Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim and Star Wars: The Old Republic. The growth in our desktop GPU business was largely offset by the decline in MCP as well as a decrease in notebook GPU revenue. While overall consumer GPU attach remained stable, we believe the decline of our notebook GPU revenue over the prior quarter was primarily a result of Intel losing some share to AMD CPU in notebook, and our absence from Apple platforms this cycle. Channel inventory was relatively flat in the quarter and remained comfortably within our target levels.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - was up 9.5 percent from the prior quarter, at a record $230.3 million. Much of this increase was driven by record revenue in our Quadro professional graphics business. This was due not only to the increase in demand for our Fermi-generation products in enterprise markets, but also to new growth we experienced for Quadro products in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Revenue from our Tesla business also increased sequentially.
Our Consumer Products business - which includes Tegra smart phone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, our embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - was up 14.0 percent over the prior quarter, at $191.1 million. This increase was primarily driven by our Tegra products, as well as a seasonal increase in game console royalties.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin of 52.2 percent and non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5 percent for the third quarter were both slightly above our estimates and a fifth consecutive record quarter, up 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent over the prior quarter, respectively. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation. Our gross margins remained very strong in the quarter primarily due to a richer product mix, with strong demand in the high-end segments of our desktop GPU products and record sales in our Quadro professional graphics products.
 
 
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses of $359.6 million were slightly below our estimates for the quarter, increasing $8.3 million compared with GAAP operating expenses of $351.3 million in the prior quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were also slightly below our estimates at $317.6 million in the third quarter, an increase of $11.6 million compared with non-GAAP operating expenses of $306.0 million in the prior quarter.
The increase in our operating expenses was primarily attributable to a full quarter of Icera operating expenses, some 28nm ramp-up costs, and planned hiring to support our strategic businesses.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $26.5 million, an effective tax rate of 12.9 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs, was $32.8 million or an effective tax rate of 13.1 percent. Our GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense were both below our estimates, driven primarily by an increase in profits above our expectations within jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is less than the U.S. statutory rates.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.75 billion, up 11 percent or $273.9 million over the prior quarter due primarily to the strength in our business and cash flow from operating activities of $244.4 million.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $371.3 million, down 11.6 percent from $419.9 million in the prior quarter. Our DSO at quarter-end was 32 days, down 6 days from 38 days in the prior quarter, as a result of strong collections and improved shipment linearity during the quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $319.6 million, down 11.7 percent from $361.9 million in the prior quarter. Our DSI at quarter-end was 57 days, down 10 days from 67 days in the prior quarter, as we continued to actively manage production builds throughout the quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $52.4 million. Capital expenditures were $39.0 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $244.4 million in the third quarter, up $162.4 million compared with $82.0 million in the prior quarter.  The increase over the prior quarter is primarily attributable to an increase in our net income, improvements in DSO and DSI, and an increase in accounts payable.
 
 
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter to be approximately $53 million to $57 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 to $40 million.
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 618 million.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Reports Financial Results for Annual and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012
SANTA CLARA, Calif.-Feb. 15, 2012-
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for fiscal 2012 ended Jan. 29, 2012 of $4.00 billion, up 12.8 percent from $3.54 billion in fiscal 2011. GAAP earnings per share for the year were $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 118.6 percent over $0.43 in fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were $1.19, up 46.9 percent over $0.81 in fiscal 2011.
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $953.2 million, down 10.6 percent from the prior quarter, and up 7.5 percent from $886.4 million in the same period a year earlier.
I am pleased with our achievements last year. Our GPU business grew sharply.  And, with the success of Tegra, we established our position in the mobile market, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. We expect continued growth ahead, as Tegra 3 powers a new wave of quad-core super phones and Kepler, our next-generation GPU architecture, sets new standards in visual and parallel computing.
On a GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $116.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. That compares with net income of $178.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the prior quarter and $171.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.
On a non-GAAP basis - which excludes certain charges or credits, as applicable in the fiscal quarter, and the tax impact associated with such items, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and legal settlements - net income was $158.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. That compares with non-GAAP net income of $217.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, and net income of $142.4 million, $0.24 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
GAAP gross margin was 51.4 percent, compared with 52.2 percent in the previous quarter and 48.1 percent in the same period a year earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation and a legal settlement charge, was 52.5 percent and compares with 52.5 percent in the previous quarter and 48.3 percent in the same period a year earlier.
Outlook
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the first quarter to be approximately $52 million to $56 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $35 to $45 million.
Diluted shares for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 622.5 million.
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012 Highlights:
CFO Commentary
Commentary on the quarter by Karen Burns, NVIDIA interim chief financial officer, is available at www.nvidia.com/ir.
Conference Call and webcast Information
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter fiscal 2012 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time). To listen to the call, please dial (706) 679 2572. A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at the NVIDIA investor relations web site
www.nvidia.com/ir
and at
www.streetevents.com
. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter fiscal 2013.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude legal settlements, a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of the NVIDIA's previous generation MCP and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CFO Commentary on Annual and Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
FY 2012 Summary
GAAP net income grew 129.5 percent, resulting in earnings of $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 118.6 percent over the prior fiscal year of $0.43 per diluted share.
Non-GAAP net income grew 54.2 percent, resulting in earnings of $1.19 per diluted share, an increase of 46.9 percent over the prior fiscal year of $0.81 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings excluded certain charges or credits, as applicable in the fiscal year, and the tax impact associated with such items, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a weak die/packaging material set charge, and legal settlements.
The growth in earnings over the prior fiscal year was largely attributable to the success of our consumer GPU business, led by strength in our Fermi-generation GPUs in desktop and notebook, and our royalty revenues related to our patent cross licensing agreement with Intel.
Revenue
Revenue for fiscal 2012 was $4.00 billion, up 12.8 percent from $3.54 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely attributable to significant growth in our Consumer Products business - which includes our Tegra smart phone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, our embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - which increased 199.2 percent over the prior fiscal year. Our Consumer Products business was greatly accelerated in fiscal year 2012 with the success of our Tegra 2 dual-core products for smart phones and tablets.
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, chipset (MCP) products and revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel - grew 0.6 percent over the prior fiscal year. This growth was despite the significant decline in our chipset product revenue as we discontinued these product lines. Excluding chipset product revenue, our consumer GPU business grew 27.4 percent over the prior fiscal year. This growth was largely attributable to strength in desktop and share gain in notebook Fermi-generation GPUs.
In fiscal 2012, we recognized $220.0 million in revenue from a patent cross licensing agreement with Intel that provides in aggregate $1.58 billion in revenue to be recognized over the six-year term.
Our Professional Solutions business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - had record revenue in fiscal year 2012 of $864.3 million, an increase of 5.6 percent over the prior fiscal year of $818.6 million. This increase was driven by a record revenue year in our Quadro professional graphics business.
Gross Margin
We had record gross margins for the fiscal year 2012 with GAAP gross margin for the fiscal year of 51.4 percent, up 11.6 percentage points from the prior fiscal's GAAP gross margin of 39.8 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded, as applicable in the fiscal year, stock-based compensation, a net charge associated with a weak die/packaging material set, and a legal settlement charge, was 51.9 percent compared with 45.1 percent in the prior year, up 6.8 percentage points.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $1.41 billion, up $254.9 million from the prior year of $1.15 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $1.25 billion, up $149.3 million from the prior year of $1.10 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded certain charges or credits, as applicable in the fiscal year, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a weak die/packaging material set charge, and a legal settlement. The increase in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to investments made in our Consumer Products business to build our next generation mobile computing architecture, Tegra 3, as well to build our next generation GPU architecture, Kepler, and other key initiatives to fuel our future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the fiscal year was $82.3 million, an effective tax rate of 12.4 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a legal settlement charge, was $110.1 million or an effective tax rate of 13.0 percent.
Q4 FY 2012 Summary
 
GAAP net income decreased 34.9 percent, with earnings of $0.19 per diluted share, a decrease of 34.5 percent over the prior quarter of $0.29 per diluted share.
Non-GAAP net income decreased 27.1 percent, with earnings of $0.26 per diluted share, a decrease of 25.7 percent over the prior quarter of $0.35 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings excluded certain charges or credits, as applicable in the fiscal quarter, and the tax impact associated with such items, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a legal settlement.
The decrease in our earnings as compared with the prior quarter was primarily due to the negative impact of the global hard disk-drive (HDD) shortage and the decline of our Tegra 2 mobile business ahead of the production ramp of devices based on the Tegra 3 processor, which reduced our sales volume and revenue in certain segments of our business.
Revenue
Revenue for fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $953.2 million, down 10.6 percent from $1.07 billion in the prior quarter.
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, chipset (MCP) products and license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel - was down 3.6 percent as compared with the previous quarter, at $621.5 million.
The decline in our GPU business over the prior quarter was largely attributable to the impact the global HDD shortage had on the PC industry. As a result, our mainstream desktop and notebook GPU businesses suffered, with a decline in sales volume and revenue over the prior quarter.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - was down 3.6 percent from the prior quarter, at $221.9 million. Revenue from our Quadro professional graphics business decreased slightly as compared with our record revenue achieved in the prior quarter. Revenue from our Tesla business increased slightly over the prior quarter.
Our Consumer Products business - which includes Tegra smart phone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, our embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - was down 42.5 percent over the prior quarter, at $109.8 million. The decrease was primarily related to the decline in our Tegra 2 mobile business ahead of the production ramp of devices based on our Tegra 3 processors. Our game console royalties also decreased significantly in the current quarter due primarily to seasonality, as well as some impact believed to be a result of the HDD shortage, as each game console requires a HDD.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.4 percent, down 0.8 percentage points from the prior quarter's GAAP gross margin of 52.2 percent and lower than our original expectations as a result of an additional charge related to a legal settlement with Rambus, not originally anticipated. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation and a legal settlement charge, was 52.5 percent, maintaining our record gross margin on a non-GAAP basis reached in the prior quarter of 52.5 percent.
Our gross margins remained very strong in the quarter as a result of continued strength in the high-end segments of our desktop GPU and Quadro professional graphics businesses.
 
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $367.7 million, up $8.1 million from the prior quarter of $359.6 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $325.2 million, up $7.6 million from the prior fiscal quarter of $317.6 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded certain charges or credits, as applicable in the fiscal quarter, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs.
The increase in our operating expenses over the prior quarter was in support of ramping new generation products on 28nm into production and planned hiring to support our strategic businesses.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $8.6 million, an effective tax rate of 6.9 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a legal settlement charge, was $19.3 million or an effective tax rate of 10.9 percent. Our GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense were both below our original estimates, driven primarily by an increase in profits above our expectations within jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is less than the U.S. statutory rates, and the catch-up adjustment necessary in the current quarter for the related annual effective tax rate of 12.4 percent and 13.0 percent on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.13 billion, up 13.9 percent or $381.2 million over the prior quarter and up 25.7 percent or $639.0 million over the prior fiscal year. The increase in the quarter and the fiscal year was primarily due to the strength in our business and the resulting cash flow from operating activities of $410.5 million in the current quarter and $909.2 million in the fiscal year.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $336.1 million, down 9.5 percent from $371.3 million in the prior quarter, and down 3.6 percent from $348.8 million in the prior year. Our DSO at the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2012 was 32 days. Our DSO for the fiscal year 2012 was 31 days, down 5 days as compared with our DSO for fiscal year 2011 of 36 days. We experienced improved shipment linearity in fiscal 2012 as well as continued strong receivable collections.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $340.3 million, up 6.5 percent from $319.6 million in the prior quarter, and down 1.5 percent from $345.5 million in the prior year. Our DSI at quarter-end was 67 days, up 10 days from 57 days in the prior quarter. Our DSI for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 was 64 days and 59 days, respectively. Our DSI increased as we ramped production builds for new generation products and transitioned to 28nm.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $51.9 million. Capital expenditures were $45.2 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $410.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 68.0 percent or $166.1 million compared with $244.4 million in the prior quarter. For the fiscal year 2012, cash flow from operating activities was $909.2 million, up 34.5 percent or $233.4 million compared with $675.8 million in the prior fiscal year.  The increase over the prior quarter was primarily related to the annual royalty payment we received during the quarter under a patent cross licensing agreement with Intel. The increase over the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase in our net income.
 
First Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the first quarter to be approximately $52 million to $56 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million.
Diluted shares for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 622.5 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude legal settlements, a charge related to the weak die/packaging material set that was used in certain versions of the NVIDIA's previous generation chipset (MCP) and GPU products, net of insurance reimbursement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the company's financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2013;impact of key initiatives to fuel future growth; and seasonal strength for our products are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 30, 2011. Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the company's website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Adoption of Fiscal Year 2013 Variable Compensation Plan
On March 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2013 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2013 Plan, which provides eligible executive officers the opportunity to earn a cash bonus award based on the level of achievement by us of certain corporate objectives, or the Corporate Targets, and by each participant of certain individual objectives, or the Individual Targets, during our fiscal year 2013. We operate on a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends (e.g., fiscal year 2013 refers to our fiscal year ending January 27, 2013).
An eligible participant's aggregate target variable cash compensation under the 2013 Plan will be allocated as follows:
(i) fifty percent (50%) of a participant's aggregate target award is based on the achievement by NVIDIA of the Corporate Targets (up to a maximum of two (2) times such portion of the participant's aggregate target award), such amount referred to as the Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount; and
(ii) fifty percent (50%) of a participant's aggregate target award is based on the achievement of such participant's Individual Targets or other criteria established by the Compensation Committee (up to a maximum of two (2) times such portion of the participant's aggregate target award), such amount referred to as the Individual Variable Cash Target Amount.
The Compensation Committee has set the Corporate Targets for fiscal year 2013 based upon the achievement of non-GAAP operating income and has established a threshhold and a maximum.
The Compensation Committee will determine the level of achievement of the Individual Targets by our chief executive officer based on their evaluation of our chief executive officer's achievements. The Compensation Committee, based upon input from our chief executive officer, will determine the level of achievement of the Individual Targets by the eligible executive officers.
If a participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, such participant may still earn his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount upon the determination of the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. If a participant does not earn an Individual Variable Cash Target Amount, he or she may still be eligible to earn a Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan. If a participant does not earn a Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount, he or she may still be eligible to earn his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount.
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2013 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.
The following table sets forth the aggregate target variable cash compensation for our named executive officers under the 2013 Plan:
Karen T. Burns serves as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Because of the interim nature of her position, she is not eligible to participate in the 2013 Plan.
The 2013 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2013 Plan.

EXHIBIT INDEX

NVIDIA CORPORATION
FISCAL YEAR 2013 VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN
    
Overview
    
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Certain Senior Officers, as defined below (collectively, the Participants), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2013 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the Committee), are employees of the Company through the date that any amounts earned hereunder are paid (each, a Variable Cash Payment), will be eligible to earn compensation under the Fiscal Year 2013 Variable Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment for performance in fiscal year 2013 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets (the Corporate Targets) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below). Payments earned based on the achievement of Corporate Targets shall be referred to herein as a Corporate Variable Cash Payment and payments earned based on the achievement of Individual Targets shall be referred to herein as an Individual Variable Cash Payment.
    
For purposes of the Plan, only the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered Senior Officers.  The Committee shall determine the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan and the Senior Officers who may be Participants hereunder.
    
For fiscal year 2013, for purposes of the Plan, Individual Targets shall be set for certain Senior Officers as follows:
    
         
Determination of Fiscal Year 2013 Variable Cash Payments
    
Certain Senior Officers are eligible to earn a Variable Cash Payment if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or such Senior Officer achieves his or her Individual Targets at specified levels. The aggregate potential amount of the Variable Cash Payment a Participant may earn under this Plan (the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount) the and the pool available to all Participants under the Plan will be set by the Committee for all Participants based on a recommendation made by the chief executive officer. A Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2013, each Participant's Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of his or her Individual Targets (the Individual Variable Cash Target Amount). A Participant may be eligible to earn more or less than his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount or Individual Variable Cash Target Amount as described more fully below.
    
Individual Variable Cash Payment
    
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or other criteria determined by the Committee.
    
The amount of the actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal 2013 (the Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved:
    
 
 
An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. In no event shall any Participant earn an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount.
1
If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, the Participant may still earn an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee (for the chief executive officer and other Senior Officers), each in their sole discretion. If a Participant does not earn an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to earn a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
    
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants based on achievement of specified fiscal year 2013 non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income, or Actual Result, is defined as GAAP operating income, as set forth in the Company's financial statements for fiscal 2013, excluding those items that are excluded from the calculation of operating income for purposes of reporting such amounts in the Company's non-GAAP financials results as part of the Company's external reporting of its GAAP financial results, with any adjustment the Committee in its sole discretion deems necessary to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the Plan. Items excluded from the Company's non-GAAP operating income generally include the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, legal settlements, and any other non-recurring or extraordinary charges or credits.
The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2013 for Participants for the award of a portion or all of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the Threshold and Maximum, respectively). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments that can be earned for fiscal 2013 (the Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments) shall be made pursuant to the following formula:
    
    
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [(Actual Result - Threshold) / (Corporate Target - Threshold)] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
    
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [((Actual Result - Corporate Target) / (Maximum - Corporate Target)) + 1] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
    
If the Actual Result equals or exceeds the Maximum, each Participant may earn two (2) times his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount.
In no event may any Participant earn an Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times of his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount.
    
If a Participant does not earn a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to earn all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
    
Miscellaneous Provisions
    
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion, but in all cases in compliance with the short-term deferral exemption from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
    
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Company's employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
    
Notwithstanding whether this Plan is referenced in another agreement, policy, arrangement or other document, only the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time.
    
2
Any Variable Cash Payments or other benefits paid under this Plan shall be subject to the Company's Clawback Policy. By accepting any payment hereunder, the Participant agrees to be subject to the Clawback Policy.
    
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Reports Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013
SANTA CLARA, Calif.-May 11, 2012-
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue of $924.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ended Apr. 29, 2012.
Kepler GPUs are accelerating our business, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. Our newly launched desktop products are winning some of the best reviews we've ever had. Notebook GPUs had a record quarter. And Tegra is on a growth track again, driven by great mobile device wins and the upcoming Windows on ARM launch."
Graphics is more important than ever. Look for exciting news next week at the GPU Technology Conference as we reveal new ways that the GPU will enhance mobile and cloud computing, he said.
Outlook
Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 is as follows:
GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to include a one-time charge related to a corporate donation to Stanford Hospital of $25 million, payable over a 10-year period. We are joining Stanford's initiative, along with other corporations in the high-tech community, including Apple, eBay, HP, Intel, Intuit and Oracle, to build a leading-edge health care institution.
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $55 million to $57 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $35 to $45 million.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 628 million.
First Quarter Fiscal 2013 and Recent Highlights:
* Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and the tax impact associated with such items.
CFO Commentary
Commentary on the quarter by Karen Burns, NVIDIA interim chief financial officer, is available at www.nvidia.com/ir.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a non-recurring charge related to a legal settlement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a non-recurring contribution expense, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CFO Commentary on First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
* Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and the tax impact associated with such items.
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, our earnings per diluted share came in slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. Revenue and gross margins were both at the high-end of our outlook, with operating expenses slightly above, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Revenue
Revenue for first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $924.9 million, at the high-end of our outlook, and down 3.0 percent from $953.2 million in the prior quarter.
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, chipset (MCP) products and license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel - was down 6.7 percent from the prior quarter, at $579.7 million.
Demand for our new Kepler
TM
generation GPU in desktop was very strong in the quarter, exceeding our supply. Our notebook business had record revenue in the first quarter on the strength of both our Kepler and Fermi
TM
generation GPUs on the ramp of the Intel Ivy Bridge platform. Despite record revenue in notebook, we were also short of customer demand due to the 28nm supply constraints at TSMC.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - was down 4.2 percent from the prior quarter, at $212.6 million. The professional solutions business remained steady and within seasonal variation.
Revenue for our Consumer Products business - which includes Tegra based smartphone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, our embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - was up 20.8 percent from the prior quarter, at $132.6 million. The increase was largely attributable to our Tegra based business, with the production ramp of devices based on our Tegra 3 processors for smartphones and tablets, offset by a decrease in our embedded businesses, entertainment and automotive.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 50.1 percent, at the high-end of our outlook, and down 1.3 percentage points from the prior quarter's GAAP gross margin of 51.4 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation and a legal settlement charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, was 50.4 percent, also at the high-end of our outlook, and down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter of 52.5 percent.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted in the first quarter as a result of the lack of 28nm supply for our new Kepler generation GPU products. With limited supply of our new high-end Kepler generation GPU in desktop, mix shifted to our mainstream business, particularly to our OEM customers. The result was a higher mix of mainstream GPU product sales and a decrease to our gross margins, as compared with the prior quarter.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $390.5 million, up slightly from our outlook, and up $22.8 million from the prior quarter of $367.7 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $348.0 million, up slightly from our outlook, and up $22.8 million from the prior quarter of $325.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded certain charges, including: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs.
The increase in our operating expenses over the prior quarter was due to planned hiring and related infrastructure spending to support our strategic businesses, and the annual FICA reset.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $16.7 million, an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent, within our outlook. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs was $24.6 million or an effective tax rate of 20.2 percent, within our outlook.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense increased over the prior quarter driven primarily by an increase in profits earned in the United States, where the statutory tax rate is greater than in other jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, the U.S. research tax credit expired in December 2011 - this had reduced the effective tax rate in the prior quarter and provided no tax benefit in the current quarter.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.13 billion, flat over the prior quarter, primarily as a result of net income being offset by an increase in accounts receivable.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $411.2 million, up 22.3 percent or $75.0 million, from $336.1 million in the prior quarter. Our DSO at the end of the current quarter was 41 days, up 9 days from 32 days in the prior quarter. Our DSO increased in the current quarter primarily as a result of the linearity of our shipments during the quarter, due to shipment of 28nm Kepler generation GPUs in the second half of the quarter.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $342.7 million, up slightly from $340.3 million in the prior quarter as we continued to ramp production builds for our new Kepler generation and Tesla products. Our DSI at quarter-end was 68 days, up one day from 67 days in the prior quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $54.5 million. Capital expenditures were $28.9 million.
Cash used in operating activities was $9.2 million in the first quarter, down 102.2 percent or $419.7 million compared with $410.5 million cash provided in the prior quarter.  The decrease over the prior quarter was primarily due to lower net income and increased accounts receivable in the current quarter, as well as the impact of a $300.0 million annual royalty payment received in the prior quarter under a patent cross licensing agreement with Intel.
Second Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows:
GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to include a one-time charge related to a corporate donation to Stanford Hospital of $25 million, payable over a 10-year period. We are joining Stanford's initiative, along with other corporations in the high-tech community, including Apple, eBay, HP, Intel, Intuit and Oracle, to build a leading-edge health care institution.
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $55 million to $57 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 628 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude a non-recurring charge related to a legal settlement, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a non-recurring contribution expense, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the company's financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2013; and the company's tax rate for the second quarter and fiscal year 2013 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended January 29, 2012. Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the company's website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

CFO Commentary on Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition related costs, a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and the tax impact associated with such items.
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.19 and $0.27, respectively, an increase of 90.0 percent and 68.8 percent compared with the prior quarter of $0.10 and $0.16, respectively.
Revenue
Revenue for second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $1.04 billion, compared with our outlook of between $990 million to $1.05 billion, and up 12.9 percent from $924.9 million in the prior quarter.
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, and license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel - was up 15.3 percent from the prior quarter, at $668.3 million.
Demand for our desktop GTX (enthusiast and performance) products was very strong in the second quarter. As anticipated, notebook GPU revenue hit a record on the strength of our Ivy Bridge design wins. Inventory in the desktop channel remained at healthy levels, down from the prior quarter.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions Business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - was down 7.7 percent from the prior quarter, at $196.3 million. Our Quadro business remained steady in the U.S. and in APAC, but experienced some softness in demand in Europe on continued weak economic conditions. We also believe the delayed ramp of Romley workstations has stalled some demand.
Revenue for our Consumer Products Business - which includes Tegra-based smartphone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - was up 35.5 percent from the prior quarter, at $179.7 million. The increase was largely attributable to record revenue for Tegra, with the continued ramp of smartphone and tablet devices based on our Tegra 3 processors.
Gross Margin
GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.8 percent, compared with our outlook of between 50.2 to 52.2 percent, and up 1.7 percentage points from the prior quarter of 50.1 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation, was 52.0 percent, compared with our outlook of between 50.5 to 52.5 percent, and up 1.6 percentage points from the prior quarter of 50.4 percent.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins improved as supply on 28nm improved, enabling us to ship more of our Kepler GPU products. The result was a higher mix of high-end GPU product sales and an increase to our gross margins, compared with the prior quarter.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $401.1 million, compared with our outlook of approximately $418.0 million, and up $10.6 million from the prior quarter of $390.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $342.5 million, compared with our outlook of $354.0 million, and down $5.5 million from the prior quarter of $348.0 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
The increase in GAAP operating expenses over the prior quarter was due to a non-recurring charge of $20.1 million for the net present value of a charitable contribution, plus planned hiring during the quarter to support our strategic businesses. These increases were offset by reductions in stock-based and other compensation costs (including FICA), lower tape-out and other engineering-related costs, and a decrease in discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excluded the aforementioned charitable contribution charge and stock-based compensation, decreased over the prior quarter due to the reductions in other compensation costs, tape-out and other engineering-related costs, and discretionary expenses, offset by planned hiring.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $26.2 million, an effective tax rate of 18.0 percent, compared with our outlook of between 19 to 21 percent, and down 3.6 percentage points from the prior quarter of 21.6 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense - excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 - was $36.0 million or an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, compared with our outlook of between 19 to 21 percent, and down 2.8 percentage points from the prior quarter of 20.2 percent.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned outside the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is lower than the U.S.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.28 billion, up $147.3 million or 4.7 percent over the prior quarter, primarily as a result of net income.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $445.3 million, up 8.3 percent or $34.1 million, from $411.2 million in the prior quarter. DSO at quarter-end was 39 days, down 2 days from 41 days in the prior quarter. Accounts receivable increased in the current quarter with the increase in revenue over the prior quarter. DSO decreased as a result of strong collections.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $387.2 million, up $44.5 million from $342.7 million in the prior quarter. DSI at quarter-end was 70 days, up 2 days from 68 days in the prior quarter. These increases were a result of ramping production for Kepler and Tegra products in support of expected demand in the third quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $56.2 million. Capital expenditures were $61.9 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $200.9 million in the second quarter, up $210.1 million compared with $9.2 million cash used in the prior quarter.  The increase over the prior quarter was primarily due to higher net income and a tax refund received in the current quarter.
Third Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows:
  
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the third quarter to be approximately $57 million to $59 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million.
Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 630 million.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Reports Financial Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013
NVIDIA Initiates Dividend; Extends Share-Repurchase Authorization
SANTA CLARA, Calif.-Nov. 8, 2012-
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue of $1.20 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 ended Oct. 28, 2012, up 15.3 percent from the previous quarter and up 12.9 percent from a year earlier.
The company also announced that it is initiating the payment of a quarterly cash dividend, and extending its existing $2.7 billion share-repurchase program, initiated in August 2004, through December 2014.
Investments in our new growth strategies paid off this quarter in record revenues and margins, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. Kepler GPUs are winning across the special-purpose PC markets we serve, from gaming to design to supercomputing. And Tegra is powering some of the most innovative tablets, phones and cars in the market.
He continued: We are pleased to start paying our shareholders a quarterly cash dividend. We have confidence in our businesses and our continued ability to grow. Given our strong financial position and ongoing ability to generate cash, we are well positioned to continue investing in our future.
 
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and the tax impact associated with such items.
Outlook
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 is as follows:
Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $58 million to $60 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million.
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 629 million.
Dividend and Share-Repurchase Program
The quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share, 30 cents on an annual basis, is equivalent to a yield of about 2.4 percent, based on the Nov. 7 closing price of $12.61. It will be payable on Dec. 14, 2012 to all shareholders of record on Nov. 23, 2012.
Since NVIDIA initiated its repurchase program in August 2004, NVIDIA has spent $1.46 billion to repurchase 90.9 million shares of its common stock. NVIDIA is authorized, subject to certain specifications, to spend up to an additional $1.24 billion repurchasing shares of its common stock.
Any future repurchases would be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or in structured share-repurchase programs, and may be made from time to time or in one or more larger repurchases. The program will be conducted in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18 and applicable legal requirements and shall be subject to market conditions and other factors. The repurchases would be funded from available working capital.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were $3.43 billion.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share, and free cash flows. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a non-recurring contribution expense, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CFO Commentary on Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
 
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and the tax impact associated with such items.
Revenue
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was a record at $1.20 billion, up 15.3 percent sequentially and up 12.9 percent year-over-year. Our outlook for revenue was $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion.
Our consumer GPU business - which includes desktop, notebook, memory, license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel, and the ramp-down of chipset (MCP) products as we exited the chipset business - had revenue of $739.6 million, up 10.7 percent sequentially and up 14.7 percent year-over-year.
Demand for our desktop GTX (enthusiast and PC gaming) products remained strong in the third quarter as we continued the launch of our Kepler based GPUs. Inventory in the channel remained healthy. As anticipated, notebook GPU revenue was at a record level on the strength of our Ivy Bridge design wins.
License revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel was flat at $66.0 million, unchanged from the previous and year-earlier quarters. MCP revenue declined to $3.3 million from $7.3 million the previous quarter and $22.4 million a year earlier.
Revenue for our Professional Solutions Business - which includes workstation graphics and computing - was $220.6 million, up 12.4 percent sequentially and down 4.2 percent year-over-year.
Our Quadro business continued to be challenged in the current quarter by the macroeconomic environment, with weak economic conditions in Europe and softness in other geographies. Conversely, our Tesla business was up both sequentially and year-over-year. The increase was largely due to the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products to Oak Ridge National Labs in connection with the build of their new Titan supercomputer.
Revenue for our Consumer Products Business - which includes Tegra-based smartphone and tablet products, Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, embedded products, and license, royalty, and other revenue associated with game consoles - was $243.9 million, up 35.7 percent sequentially and 27.6 percent year-over-year. The increase was largely attributable to record revenue for Tegra, as our Tegra 3 processors continued to ship in smartphone and tablet devices.
Gross Margin
We achieved record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the current quarter. GAAP gross margin was 52.9 percent, compared with our outlook of 51.8 percent - up 1.1 percentage points sequentially and 0.7 percentage point year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation, was 53.1 percent, compared with our outlook of 52.0 percent - up 1.1 percentage points sequentially and 0.6 percentage point year-over-year.
Our gross margins continued to improve as we shipped more of our Kepler GPU products, including a greater mix into our high-end segments.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $384.4 million, below our outlook of approximately $390.0 million, and down from the prior quarter's $401.1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $344.8 million, below our outlook of $350.0 million, and up from the prior quarter's $342.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
The decrease in GAAP operating expenses over the prior quarter was due to the absence of a non-recurring charge of $20.1 million for the net present value of a charitable contribution, reductions in other compensation costs (including FICA) and discretionary expenses. These decreases were offset by planned hiring to support our strategic businesses and higher tape-out and other engineering-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excluded the aforementioned charitable contribution charge and stock-based compensation, increased over the prior quarter due to planned hiring and tape-out and other engineering-related costs, offset by the reductions in other compensation costs and discretionary expenses.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $44.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 17.6 percent, compared with our outlook of between 19 to 21 percent, and down 0.4 percentage point from the prior quarter's 18.0 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense - excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 - was $50.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 17.0 percent, compared with our outlook of between 19 to 21 percent, and down 0.4 percentage point from the prior quarter's 17.4 percent.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned outside the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is lower than the U.S.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.43 billion, up $156.7 million or 4.8 percent over the prior quarter, primarily as a result of net income.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $444.9 million, down $0.4 million from $445.3 million in the prior quarter. DSO at quarter-end was 34 days, down 5 days from 39 days in the prior quarter. Accounts receivable and DSO decreased in the current quarter despite the increase in revenue over the prior quarter, as a result of shipment linearity and strong collections.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $429.0 million, up $41.8 million from $387.2 million in the prior quarter. DSI at quarter-end was 69 days, down one day from the prior quarter. The increase in inventory in the current quarter was largely attributable to production builds of our Kepler GPU products in support of expected demand, offset by declines in our Fermi-based GPUs.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $57.1 million. Capital expenditures were $44.7 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was $181.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, down $19.4 million compared with $200.9 million in the prior quarter.  The decrease over the prior quarter was primarily due to the absence of a tax refund received in the prior quarter, offset by higher net income, improved shipment linearity and strong collections. Free cash flow was $136.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and $138.9 million in the prior quarter.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter to be approximately $58 million to $60 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million.
Diluted shares for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 629 million.

CFO Commentary on Annual and Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
FY 2013 Summary
 
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a contribution expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, a legal settlement charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and the tax impact associated with such items.
Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we have been reporting three primary financial reporting segments - GPU, Professional Solutions Business, and Consumer Products Business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we began reporting two primary financial reporting segments - GPU and Tegra Processor. This change reflects the way we are now managing our businesses internally.
The GPU business leverages our GPU technology across multiple end markets. It comprises four primary product lines: GeForce for desktop and notebook PCs and Macs; Quadro for professional workstations; Tesla for high-performance servers and workstations; and NVIDIA GRID for server graphics solutions. It also includes other related products, licenses and revenue supporting the GPU business, such as memory products.
The Tegra Processor business comprises product lines primarily based on our Tegra SOC and modem processor technologies. This includes Tegra for smartphones and tablets (including for Windows RT-based devices); automotive computers, including infotainment and navigation systems; and gaming devices, including Project SHIELD. It also includes other related products, licenses and revenue supporting the Tegra Processor business - such as Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers, embedded products, and license and other revenue associated with game consoles.
The All Other category includes license revenue from our patent cross license agreement with Intel.
All prior periods reflected herein are based on our new reporting segments. The appended table provides historical revenue by quarter.
Revenue
Revenue for fiscal 2013 was a record at $4.28 billion, up 7.1 percent from the prior fiscal year.
This increase was largely attributable to record revenue for our Tegra Processor business, which increased 29.3 percent from the previous year. Within this business, Tegra products for smartphones and tablets, including Windows RT-based devices, rose 50.3 percent to $540.5 million, in line with our outlook. Tegra Processor revenue also includes license fees and other revenue related to game consoles, which decreased 43.3 percent over the prior fiscal year, offset by a 51.5 percent increase in revenue for our automotive products.
The GPU business grew 2.0 percent over the prior fiscal year, despite the $173.1 million decline in revenue from chipset products, which were discontinued. Excluding chipset product revenue, the GPU business grew 8.0 percent.
This growth was largely attributable to strong demand for our GeForce GTX desktop and notebook GPU products. With the introduction of Kepler generation GPUs in fiscal 2013, our desktop and notebook revenue grew by 5.9 and 26.4 percent, respectively. The GPU business also benefited from a 36.5 percent increase in Tesla revenue, offset by a 5.9 percent revenue decrease in Quadro, due to general weakness in Western Europe.
In All Other, a full year of royalty revenue of $264.0 million was recorded under our cross license agreement with Intel compared with a partial year in fiscal 2012 of $220.0 million. Revenue is recognized based, in part, on our valuation of the consideration exchanged, whereas cash is recorded when installment payments are received, as provided under the cross license agreement.
Gross Margin
We had record gross margins for fiscal 2013, with GAAP gross margin of 52.0 percent. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation, was a record 52.3 percent. Both GAAP and non-GAAP margins were in line with our outlook given at the beginning of the year.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2013 were $1.58 billion, up $169.9 million, or 12.1 percent, from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.40 billion, up $150.0 million, or 12.0 percent, in line with our outlook given at the beginning of the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a contribution expense related to a corporate donation in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to investments in our Tegra Processor business. This includes efforts to build next-generation energy-efficient computing architectures, such as Tegra 4 and our integrated SOC solutions, which combine Tegra application processors and Icera baseband processors. They also include work within GPU to build out our Kepler product lines across GeForce, Quadro, and Tesla, and invest in our next-generation GPUs, as well as to fund other key initiatives to fuel future growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the fiscal year 2013 was $99.5 million, an effective tax rate of 15.0 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and a corporate donation, was $126.6 million in fiscal 2013, or an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our GAAP and non-GAAP annual effective tax rates reflect the extension of the U.S. research tax credit as explained under our Q4 FY 2013 Summary for tax expense.
Q4 FY 2013 Summary
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a legal settlement charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and the tax impact associated with such items.
 
Revenue
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $1.11 billion, down 8.1 percent sequentially and up 16.1 percent year-over-year. Our outlook was $1.025 billion to $1.175 billion.
The GPU business had revenue of $832.5 million, down $61.7 million or 6.9 percent sequentially and up $55.1 million or 7.1 percent year-over-year.
The sequential decline stems from desktop GPUs, where the channel returned to its normal run-rate demand following a strong launch of Kepler GPUs in Q3. Revenue from notebook GPUs increased slightly and remained at record levels on the strength of our Ivy Bridge design wins. Quadro revenue increased 10.4 percent, driven, in part, by our new Quadro Kepler GPUs. Tesla GPU product sales were lower, following the previous quarter' large sale of Kepler-based products to Oak Ridge National Labs for its Titan supercomputer.
The year-on-year increase in our GPU business reflects the strength of notebook GPUs related to Ivy Bridge design wins. Tesla revenue was also up, as our run-rate business continued to increase. Revenue decreased from memory products.
The Tegra Processor business had revenue of $208.4 million in the fourth quarter, down 14.6 percent sequentially and up 89.8 percent year-over-year.
The sequential decrease was largely attributable to lower sales volume of Tegra 3, following record revenue in Q3 from sales into smartphone and tablets ahead of the holiday season, as well as of game consoles and automotive products. These decreases were offset by the sequential increase in revenue from sales of embedded products.
The year-over-year increase in our Tegra Processor business was largely due to higher sales volume of Tegra 3 for smartphone and tablet devices compared with the prior year when revenue declined in the two quarters ahead of the production ramp of Tegra 3 devices. It also reflected higher revenue from automotive and embedded products, offset by lower revenue associated with game consoles.
License revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel was at $66.0 million, unchanged from the previous and year-earlier quarters.
Gross Margin
Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins remained at record levels. GAAP gross margin was 52.9 percent, in line with our outlook - unchanged sequentially and up 1.5 percentage points year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation and a legal settlement charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, was 53.2 percent, compared with our outlook of 53.1 percent - up 0.1 percentage point sequentially and up 0.7 percentage point year-over-year.
Gross margins remained at record levels reflecting the stable mix between higher-margin and lower-margin products across the GPU and Tegra Processor businesses.
Expenses and Other
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $402.0 million, in line with our outlook of approximately $400.0 million, and up from the prior quarter's $384.4 million and prior year's $367.7 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $360.4 million, also in line with our outlook of approximately $359.0 million, and up from the prior quarter's $344.8 million and prior year's $325.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs.
The increase in operating expenses over the prior quarter and fiscal year was largely related to employee compensation, benefits, and other employee-related costs - including, annual pay increases, planned hiring to support our strategic businesses, the beginning of a company 401K match in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and related infrastructure costs to support our employee growth. The sequential increase was also due to higher tape-out and other engineering-related costs, and incremental discretionary costs to support our key initiatives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $12.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 6.5 percent, down 11.1 percentage points from the prior quarter's 17.6 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense was $15.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 6.8 percent, down 10.2 percentage points from the prior quarter's 17.0 percent.
The decreases in both the GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates were largely due to the extension of the U.S. research tax credit under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, enacted January 2, 2013. The Act provided for retroactive application of the research credit from December 31, 2011, the expiration date under prior law, through to December 31, 2013. As a result, our fourth quarter and annual effective tax rates for fiscal year 2013 reflect 13 months of benefit for the research tax credit. This brought our annual effective tax rates on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to 15.0 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively, in line with our outlook of approximately 16 percent, with the benefit of the U.S. research tax credit.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.73 billion, up $293.1 million or 8.5 percent over the prior quarter and up $598.3 million or 19.1 percent over the prior fiscal year. The sequential and annual increase in cash is explained within cash flow below.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $454.3 million, up $9.4 million from $444.9 million in the prior quarter, and up $118.1 million from $336.1 million in the prior year. Accounts receivable increased in Q4 as compared with the prior quarter primarily due to slightly less linear monthly shipments. Accounts receivable increased over the prior year primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. DSO at quarter-end was 37 days, up three days from 34 days in the prior quarter, and up five days from 32 days in Q4 fiscal 2012.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $419.7 million, down $9.3 million from $429.0 million in the prior quarter, and up $79.4 million from $340.3 million in the Q4 fiscal 2012. DSI at quarter-end was 73 days, up four days from 69 days in the prior quarter, and up six days from 67 days in the prior year.
Cash flow from operating activities was $451.0 million in the fourth quarter and $824.2 million in fiscal 2013, compared with $181.5 million in the third quarter and $909.2 million in fiscal 2012.  The sequential increase was primarily due to the $300.0 million annual royalty payment received under a patent licensing agreement with Intel and moderate inventory purchases, offset by lower net income. The decrease from the prior year was attributable to lower net income, higher accounts receivable due to less linear shipments, and higher inventory driven by the production ramp for Kepler.
Free cash flow was $403.3 million in the fourth quarter and $640.9 million in fiscal 2013, compared with $136.8 million in the third quarter and $770.4 million in fiscal 2012.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $58.4 million. Capital expenditures were $47.8 million.
First Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, is as follows:
 
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the first quarter to be approximately $59 million to $61 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million.
Diluted shares for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 619 million.
In fiscal year 2014, we expect to break ground on a new building for our headquarters campus in Santa Clara to provide for our near-term growth needs. This 500,000 square foot building will provide 2,500 seats and be built on land we purchased five years ago. We evaluated various alternatives to optimize our specific needs at the best value-cost equation and determined that constructing our own building to be the optimal choice. We estimate capital funding for the project to ramp in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. We will capitalize these costs on our balance sheet until the building is in service and then depreciate as part of our total company's operating expenses beginning approximately in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We will provide quarterly forecasts of capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization for this project as part of our outlook as these costs are expected to be incurred.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share, and free cash flows. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, a contribution expense, a legal settlement charge, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical
financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the company's financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014; and the company's tax rate for the first quarter and fiscal year 2014 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 28, 2012. Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the company's website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Adoption of Fiscal Year 2014 Variable Compensation Plan
On March 27, 2013, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2014 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2014 Plan, which provides eligible executive officers the opportunity to earn a cash bonus award based on the level of achievement by us of certain corporate objectives, or the Corporate Targets, and by each participant of certain individual objectives, or the Individual Targets, during our fiscal year 2014. We operate on a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends (e.g., fiscal year 2014 refers to our fiscal year ending January 26, 2014).
An eligible participants aggregate target variable cash compensation under the 2014 Plan will be allocated as follows:
(i) fifty percent (50%) of a participants aggregate target award is based on the achievement by NVIDIA of the Corporate Targets (up to a maximum of two (2) times such portion of the participants aggregate target award), such amount referred to as the Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount; and
(ii) fifty percent (50%) of a participants aggregate target award is based on the achievement of such participants Individual Targets or other criteria established by the Compensation Committee (up to a maximum of two (2) times such portion of the participants aggregate target award), such amount referred to as the Individual Variable Cash Target Amount.
The Compensation Committee has set the Corporate Targets for fiscal year 2014 based upon the achievement of non-GAAP operating income and has established a threshold and a maximum.
The Compensation Committee will determine the level of achievement of the Individual Targets by our chief executive officer based on their evaluation of our chief executive officers achievements. The Compensation Committee, based upon input from our chief executive officer, will determine the level of achievement of the Individual Targets by the eligible executive officers.
If a participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, such participant may still earn his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount upon the determination of the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. If a participant does not earn an Individual Variable Cash Target Amount, he or she may still be eligible to earn a Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan. If a participant does not earn a Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount, he or she may still be eligible to earn his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount.
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2014 Plan to be eligible to earn an award.
The following table sets forth the aggregate target variable cash compensation for our named executive officers under the 2014 Plan:
The 2014 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2014 Plan.

EXHIBIT INDEX

NVIDIA CORPORATION
FISCAL YEAR 2014 VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN
    
Overview
    
The compensation philosophy of NVIDIA Corporation (the 
Company
) is to attract, motivate, retain and reward its management through a combination of base salary and performance based compensation. Certain Senior Officers, as defined below (collectively, the 
Participants
), who are employed at the Company during fiscal year 2014 and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the 
Committee
), are employees of the Company through the date that any amounts earned hereunder are paid (each, a 
Variable Cash Payment
), will be eligible to earn compensation under the Fiscal Year 2014 Variable Compensation Plan (the 
Plan
). The Plan is designed to award a Variable Cash Payment for performance in fiscal year 2014 to a Participant if the Company achieves certain corporate performance targets (the 
Corporate Targets
) and/or if the Participant achieves certain Individual Targets (as defined below). Payments earned based on the achievement of Corporate Targets shall be referred to herein as a 
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
 and payments earned based on the achievement of Individual Targets shall be referred to herein as an 
Individual Variable Cash Payment
.
    
For purposes of the Plan, only the Companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer, other executive officers and certain other senior officers shall be considered 
Senior Officers
.  The Committee shall determine the persons to be specified as Senior Officers for purposes of this Plan and the Senior Officers who may be Participants hereunder.
    
For fiscal year 2014, for purposes of the Plan, 
Individual Targets
 shall be set for certain Senior Officers as follows:
    
         
Determination of Fiscal Year 2014 Variable Cash Payments
    
Certain Senior Officers are eligible to earn a Variable Cash Payment at a specified target amount (the 
Variable Cash Payment Target Amount
) if the Company achieves its Corporate Targets and/or such Senior Officer achieves his or her Individual Targets at specified target levels. A Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount is based on the difficulty and responsibility of each position. For fiscal year 2014, each Participants Variable Cash Payment Target Amount will be split such that fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of the Corporate Targets (the 
Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
) and fifty percent (50%) is allocated to the achievement of his or her Individual Targets (the 
Individual Variable Cash Target Amount
). A Participant may be eligible to earn more or less than his or her Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount or Individual Variable Cash Target Amount as described more fully below.
    
Individual Variable Cash Payment
    
An Individual Variable Cash Payment may be awarded to a Participant based on the achievement of his or her Individual Targets or other criteria determined by the Committee.
    
The amount of the actual Individual Variable Cash Payments to be made for fiscal year 2014 (the 
Actual Individual Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following guidelines and taking into account whether Individual Targets have been achieved:
    
 
 An Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Variable Cash Payment Target Amount may be awarded to a Participant for extraordinary individual performance. In no event shall any Participant earn an Actual Individual Variable Cash Payment in excess of two (2) times the amount of his or her Individual Variable Cash Target Amount. If a Participant achieves only a portion of his or her Individual Targets, the Participant may still earn an Actual Individual Variable
1
Cash Payment to the extent determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. If a Participant does not earn an Individual Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to earn a Corporate Variable Cash Payment as outlined below.
Corporate Variable Cash Payment
    
The Committee has set the Corporate Targets for the Participants based on achievement of specified target fiscal year 2014 non-GAAP operating income. For purposes of the Plan, non-GAAP operating income, or 
Actual Result
, is defined as GAAP operating income, as set forth in the Companys financial statements for fiscal year 2014, excluding those items that are excluded from the calculation of operating income for purposes of reporting such amounts in the Companys non-GAAP financial results as part of the Companys external reporting of its GAAP financial results, with any adjustment (which may include legal related costs) the Committee in its sole discretion deems necessary to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the Plan. Items excluded from the Companys non-GAAP operating income generally include the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, legal settlements, and any other non-recurring or extraordinary charges or credits.
The Committee has also set threshold and maximum Actual Result targets for fiscal year 2014 for Participants for the award of a portion or all of the Corporate Variable Cash Payment (the 
Threshold
 and 
Maximum
, respectively). The actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments that may be earned for fiscal year 2014 (the 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payments
) shall be made pursuant to the following:
    
    
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [(Actual Result - Threshold) / (Corporate Target - Threshold)] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
    
 
Actual Corporate Variable Cash Payment  =    [((Actual Result - Corporate Target) / (Maximum - Corporate Target)) + 1] * Corporate Variable Cash Target Amount
    
    
If a Participant does not earn a Corporate Variable Cash Payment, he or she may still be eligible to earn all or a portion of an Individual Variable Cash Payment as outlined above.
    
Miscellaneous Provisions
    
Payments under this Plan shall be made following the end of the fiscal year, on such schedule as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion, but in all cases in compliance with the short-term deferral exemption from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
    
Participation in the Plan shall not alter in any way the at will nature of the Companys employment of a Participant, and such employment may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause and with or without prior notice.
    
Notwithstanding whether this Plan is referenced in another agreement, policy, arrangement or other document, only the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend or terminate this Plan at any time.
    
2
Any Variable Cash Payments or other benefits paid under this Plan shall be subject to the Companys Clawback Policy. By accepting any payment hereunder, the Participant agrees to be subject to the Clawback Policy.
    
This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

EXHIBIT INDEX

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
NVIDIA Reports Financial Results for First Quarter Fiscal 2014
SANTA CLARA, Calif.-May 9, 2013-
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, ended April 28, 2013, of $954.7 million, down 13.7 percent from $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.13, down 53.6 percent from $0.28 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.18, down 48.6 percent from $0.35 in the prior quarter.
As previously announced, NVIDIA plans to return in excess of $1 billion this fiscal year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. During the first quarter, NVIDIA returned $146.3 million to shareholders by repurchasing $100 million of shares, and paying $46.3 million of dividends, or $0.075 per share. As part of NVIDIA's capital return program, the company plans to continue its quarterly dividend program at $0.075 per share and to return additional cash of at least $750 million during fiscal 2014, largely through a structured share repurchase program.
The success of Kepler-based GPUs within and beyond the PC helped drive another quarter of record margins, said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA.  Kepler is capturing share among gamers, strengthening our workstation and supercomputing segments, and will fuel new growth opportunities for our GRID server graphics solutions. With Tegra 4 devices and Tegra 4i certification on the way, we're gearing up to return to growth in the second half.
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the tax impact associated with such items.
NVIDIA's outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $61 million to $63 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 590 million.
Among highlights of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, NVIDIA:
Dividend
NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 cents per share on June 14, 2013, to all stockholders of record on May 23, 2013.

Commentary on the quarter by Karen Burns, NVIDIA interim chief financial officer, and a presentation, are available at

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.
NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

CFO Commentary on First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014
The following information has been prepared on a GAAP basis except where noted.
Summary Results
 
*Non-GAAP earnings excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the tax impact associated with such items.
Revenue
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $954.7 million, down 13.7 percent sequentially and up 3.2 percent year over year. Our outlook was $920 million to $960 million.
The GPU business had revenue of $785.6 million, down 5.6 percent sequentially and up 8.1 percent year over year.
The sequential decrease stems largely from declines in both desktop and notebook revenue. In desktop GPUs, volume decreased as the channel reduced inventory and returned to a stable run-rate following the strong launch of Kepler GPUs, top-to-bottom. In notebook GPUs, we believe OEMs continued to closely manage inventory levels of older generation PCs ahead of Intel's launch of its Haswell platform. Quadro revenue remained relatively flat following a recent high in revenue in Q4. Tesla revenue also remained flat, following a strong Q4, with its underlying run-rate business continuing to strengthen.
The year-over-year increase in our GPU business reflects the enduring strength of both desktop and notebook GPUs, with a greater mix of Kepler GPUs in the current quarter. Tesla revenue was also up, as we continued to gain traction in new market opportunities.
The Tegra Processor business had revenue of $103.1 million in the first quarter, down 50.5 percent sequentially and down 22.2 percent year-over-year.
The sequential and year-over-year decreases were largely due to lower sales volume of Tegra 3 processors, as customers began to ramp down production of Tegra 3 based smartphones and tablets. We expect customers to start announcing Tegra 4 designs during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, with the ramp in new designs and volume throughout the second half of the year. The decreases also reflect lower revenue from the sale of embedded products, offset by higher revenue from automotive products. Revenue associated with game consoles remained relatively flat sequentially and was lower year over year.
License revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel was $66.0 million, unchanged from the previous and year-earlier quarters.
Gross Margin
We achieved record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the first quarter. GAAP gross margin was 54.3 percent, compared with our outlook of 52.9 percent - up 1.4 percentage points sequentially and up 4.2 percentage points year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded stock-based compensation, was 54.6 percent, compared with our outlook of 53.2 percent - up 1.4 percentage points sequentially and up 4.2 percentage points year-over-year.
Gross margins continued to improve due to a richer mix of higher-margin products - with strength in GeForce GTX, Quadro and Tesla.
Expenses and Other
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $435.8 million and $396.2 million, both in line with our outlook of approximately $430.0 million and $395.0 million, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other acquisition-related costs.
The increase in operating expenses over the prior quarter and fiscal year was largely related to planned hiring to drive our growth strategies - employee compensation, benefits, and other employee-related costs.
The year-over-year increase also reflects the company's annual pay increase and 401(k) match program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded:
GAAP income tax expense for the quarter was $10.2 million, or an effective tax rate of 11.6 percent, up 5.1 percentage points from the prior quarter's 6.5 percent. Non-GAAP income tax expense was $16.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 12.7 percent, up 5.9 percentage points from the prior quarter's 6.8 percent.
The sequential increases in both the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were largely due to the absence of a full-year discrete benefit for the U.S. research tax credit. U.S. tax law enacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 provided for retroactive application of the research credit from December 31, 2011 through to December 31, 2013. As a result, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 reflects 13 months of benefit for the research tax credit, which brought the annual effective tax rates for fiscal 2013 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to 15.0 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively.
Our outlook for GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter and annual fiscal 2014 were both between 15 percent and 17 percent, including 11 month's benefit of the U.S. research tax credit and excluding any discrete tax events that may occur during a quarter. Our actual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates in the current quarter were both lower than our outlook as a result of favorable discrete tax events that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 - largely related to the release of certain foreign tax reserves.
Balance Sheet
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $3.71 billion, down $14.5 million or 0.4 percent from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of $100.0 million of share repurchases during the quarter and $46.3 million in quarterly dividend payments, offset by free cash flow of $110.0 million.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $347.0 million, down $107.3 million from $454.3 million in the prior quarter. DSO at quarter-end was 33 days, down 4 days from 37 days in the prior quarter. Accounts receivable and DSO decreased in the current quarter due to strong collections and slightly more linear monthly shipments.
Inventories at the end of the quarter were $377.6 million, down $42.1 million from $419.7 million in the prior quarter. DSI at quarter-end was 79 days, up 6 days from 73 days in the prior quarter, due to decreased sales volume.
Cash flow from operating activities was $175.7 million in the first quarter, down $275.3 million from $451.0 million in the prior quarter.  The sequential decrease was primarily due to the absence of the $300.0 million annual royalty payment under a patent licensing agreement with Intel received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and lower net income, offset by a reduction in inventory purchases and lower accounts receivable.
Free cash flow was $110.0 million in the first quarter and $403.3 million in the prior quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $59.7 million. Capital expenditures were $65.7 million.
Second Quarter Outlook
Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 is as follows:
We estimate depreciation and amortization for the second quarter to be approximately $61 million to $63 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million.
Diluted shares for the second quarter are expected to be approximately 590 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per share, and free cash flows. In order for NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
Certain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: the enduring strength of desktop and notebook GPUs; customer announcements of Tegra 4 designs during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, with ramp in new designs and volume throughout the second half of the year; the company's financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2014; and the company's tax rate for the second quarter and fiscal year 2014 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended January 27, 2013. Copies of reports filed with the SEC are posted on the company's website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 14, 2013, NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA) entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman) to repurchase a total of $750 million of NVIDIA common stock. NVIDIA will acquire the shares under the ASR Agreement as part of its previously announced intention to return in excess of $1 billion to shareholders in the current fiscal year.
Under the ASR Agreement, NVIDIA will pay $750 million and will receive a majority of the shares underlying the ASR Agreement during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Any remaining shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement, if any, will be based generally on the daily volume-weighted average price of NVIDIA common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement.
At settlement, under certain circumstances, Goldman may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to NVIDIA, or, under certain circumstances, NVIDIA may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to Goldman. The ASR Agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type, including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances generally under which the ASR Agreement may be accelerated, extended or terminated early by Goldman and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the parties to one another. Purchases under the ASR Agreement are expected to be completed before the end of October 2013, although the completion date may be accelerated at Goldmans option. The actual number of shares repurchased will be determined at that time.
