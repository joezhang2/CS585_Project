EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibits: 99 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated April 21, 2003.

Exhibit 99 Lexmark reports EPS growth of 36 percent for first quarter - - Supplies annuity continued to drive growth - Lexington, Ky., April 21, 2003 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record financial results for the first quarter of 2003. First-quarter revenue was $1.108 billion, up 6 percent from the same period in 2002. Net earnings per share were a record 73 cents, up 36 percent from the year-ago quarter. "Lexmark continues to report record financial results despite a slow technology market and a sluggish economy," stated Paul J. Curlander, chairman and CEO. "The consistency of our results again demonstrates the strength and stability of our supplies-driven business model." Laser and inkjet supplies revenue grew 17 percent Lexmark's revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 was $1.108 billion, up 6 percent from $1.050 billion in the same period of 2002, and was positively impacted 7 percent from foreign currency translation. Laser and inkjet supplies revenue was $642 million, a 17 percent increase over $546 million a year ago, and now represents 58 percent of total revenue, up from 52 percent in the prior-year quarter. Laser and inkjet printer revenue was $370 million, down 8 percent from $401 million in the first quarter of 2002. Gross profit was $356 million or 32.1 percent of revenue for the quarter, versus $310 million or 29.5 percent a year ago. The improvement in gross profit margin was due to an increase of supplies in the product mix and higher supplies margins, somewhat offset by lower printer margins. Operating expense was $228 million compared to $205 million in the prior year. Operating income for the first quarter was $129 million or 11.6 percent of revenue versus $105 million or 10.0 percent of revenue a year earlier. Net earnings were $95 million in the first quarter, up 32 percent from $72 million reported a year ago. Diluted net earnings per share for the period were 73 cents, an increase of 36 percent from 53 cents in the same period of 2002. Lexmark's debt-to-total-capital ratio at March 31, 2003 was 11 percent, down from 13 percent at December 31, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities was $237 million versus $115 million a year earlier. Capital expenditures were $16 million in the first quarter.
Continued Technology Leadership Earlier this month, Lexmark unveiled a wide range of laser-printer products and solutions, including low-end monochrome printers, high-performance color and monochrome workgroup devices, and multifunction products. Included in these announcements are: o The Lexmark E321 and E323, 20 pages-per-minute (ppm) laser printers priced at $299 and $399, respectively. o The Lexmark T630, T632, and T634 laser products, printing at speeds of 35, 40, and 45 ppm and priced at $749, $999, and $1,399, respectively. o The Lexmark X630, X632, and X632e, multifunction versions of the new T-family of laser printers, priced at $2,749, $3,749, and $6,459, respectively. o The Lexmark C912 color laser product, printing at 28 ppm and priced at $3,499. "These announcements demonstrate that we continue to lead the industry in price performance," Curlander noted. "More importantly, these products continue to strengthen our ability to provide distributed, low-cost, high-performance network print devices that are modular and can be configured into multifunction workflow products which strengthen our solutions and services initiatives." Looking forward: "As we look forward to the second quarter, we believe the strength and appeal of our new product announcements, coupled with the power of our supplies annuity, will keep us well-positioned for growth," stated Curlander. "However, we remain cautious due to softness in corporate and consumer spending and aggressive pricing competition. In the second quarter of 2003, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits and earnings per share to be in the range of 70 to 80 cents, versus 67 cents reported in 2002." ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Monday, April 21, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (888-338-6461). A live broadcast over the Internet and a complete replay of this call can be accessed from Lexmark's investor relations web site at http://investor.lexmark.com.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), included in this release is an estimate of the impact of foreign currency translation on GAAP-reported revenue. This supplemental disclosure is intended to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of the company's revenue without the impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates. The calculation translates current-period GAAP foreign currency revenue at prior-period translation rates and compares the resultant revenue to prior-period reported revenue. Foreign currencies strengthening (weakening) against the U. S. dollar will result in higher (lower) GAAP-reported revenue for the company.

Laser and inkjet printer revenue was $770 million compared to $795 million in the first six months of 2002. Gross profit margin was 33.1 percent, up 2.3 points from the prior year. Operating income was $266 million versus $227 million a year earlier, an increase of 17 percent. Net earnings for the period were $1.50 per share on a diluted basis, an increase of 25 percent over the $1.20 per share recorded in the first half of 2002. Looking forward: "As we look forward to the third quarter, we believe our extensive corporate and consumer product launches in the second quarter have put us in a good position for the second half of 2003," said Curlander. "We continue to be cautious, however, due to softness in corporate and consumer spending, and aggressive pricing competition. In the third quarter of 2003, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits and earnings per share of 63 to 73 cents, compared to 70 cents in the third quarter of 2002." ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Monday, July 21, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (888-338-6461).

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibits: 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated October 20, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark International reports third-quarter revenue growth of 11 percent Lexington, Ky., Oct. 20, 2003 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2003. Revenue of $1.157 billion rose 11 percent, the highest year-to-year growth rate since the first quarter of 2001. Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter were 79 cents compared to 70 cents a year earlier. "Our third-quarter results reflect strong sales of both inkjet and laser printers which with their associated supplies drove overall revenue to record levels," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Third-quarter laser and inkjet printer revenue climbs 13 percent For the third quarter, Lexmark's revenue was $1.157 billion, an 11 percent increase from the $1.041 billion reported in the same period of 2002. Laser and inkjet supplies revenue of $641 million was 55 percent of total revenue and up 13 percent from $568 million a year ago. Laser and inkjet printer revenue was $430 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 13 percent from $381 million a year earlier. Gross profit margin was 32.1 percent for the quarter versus 32.5 percent a year ago due to lower printer margins, partially offset by higher supplies margins. Operating expenses were $231 million compared with $215 million in the prior year. Operating income margin was 12.1 percent in the third quarter of 2003 versus 11.9 percent last year. Diluted net earnings per share for the period were 79 cents. This compares to third-quarter 2002 earnings per share of 70 cents, which were negatively impacted 9 cents from an asset impairment write-off. Lexmark's debt-to-total-capital ratio at Sept. 30, 2003 was 9 percent compared to 10 percent at June 30, 2003. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $23 million. Innovative business and consumer products launched Lexmark continued its tradition of rapidly developing innovative technologies that meet the ever-expanding needs of its customers by introducing several industry-leading printing solutions in the quarter.
o The Lexmark X215 is the first laser multifunction product (MFP) that comes standard with an automatic document feeder and high-speed fax for just $499. o The Lexmark E220, printing at up to 18 pages per minute (ppm), has the fastest rated print speed of any laser printer priced under $200. o The Lexmark PrinTrio Photo P3150 is the first sub-$100 All-In-One device with built-in camera card slots. Further enhancing this powerful product lineup, Lexmark today announced several printing solutions for its growing enterprise customer base. The new Lexmark C752 can print up to 20 ppm in monochrome and color and offers a nearly 30 percent operating cost advantage over its closest competitor. To address the growing trend of device consolidation, it is available in the new Lexmark X752e MFP, which also provides high-performance copying, faxing and scanning. The company also unveiled the Lexmark X912e MFP, a wide-format laser product that delivers up to 28 color ppm and the Lexmark Document Solutions Suite 3.2, enhanced document processing software that helps businesses improve productivity and reduce costs. Supplies-driven business model fuels nine-month EPS growth Revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2003 was $3.385 billion, an increase of 7 percent versus $3.149 billion in the same period of 2002. Revenue from laser and inkjet supplies grew 14 percent to $1.913 billion from $1.681 billion a year ago. Laser and inkjet printer revenue was $1.200 billion compared to $1.176 billion in the first nine months of 2002. Gross profit margin was 32.7 percent, up 1.4 points from the prior year. Operating income was $406 million versus $351 million a year earlier, an increase of 16 percent. Net earnings per share on a diluted basis for the period were $2.29, up 21 percent over the $1.89 per share recorded in the same period of 2002. Looking forward: "We believe that our strong product launches this year for both home and business users position us well for the fourth quarter," said Curlander. "Nevertheless, we continue to be cautious due to the uncertain economic environment and aggressive price competition. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate of mid- to high-single digits and earnings per share of 85 to 95 cents." ###

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibits: 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated April 19, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports first-quarter EPS growth of 25 percent Lexington, Ky., April 19, 2004- Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2004. Revenue increased 13 percent to $1.256 billion and earnings per share were 91 cents, up 25 percent from a year ago. "Our first quarter results came in above our expectation and marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth," stated Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and CEO. "These strong results reflect Lexmark's exclusive focus on printing solutions and the power of our supplies-driven business model." Gross profit was $411 million or 32.7 percent of revenue for the quarter, versus $356 million or 32.1 percent a year ago. The higher gross profit margin was due to improved product margins, somewhat offset by a higher mix of printer revenue. Operating expense for the first quarter was $246 million compared to $228 million in the same period of 2003. Operating income was $165 million or 13.2 percent of revenue versus $129 million or 11.6 percent of revenue a year earlier. Net earnings were $121 million in the first quarter, up 28 percent from $95 million reported a year ago. Diluted net earnings per share for the period were 91 cents, an increase of 25 percent from 73 cents in the prior year. Lexmark's debt-to-total-capital ratio at March 31, 2004 was 8 percent, unchanged from December 31, 2003. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the first quarter. New products raise the price/performance standard During the first quarter, Lexmark unveiled an array of new inkjet printers and All-In-One (AIO) products to meet the needs of consumers and small office/home office professionals. For the photo enthusiast, a new fade-resistant ink technology is now available in printers and AIOs at best-in-class print speeds. Small businesses can benefit from several AIOs offering the latest ink technology with easy-to-use software, all priced affordably from $79 to $129. The company also launched the $699 Lexmark C510 color laser printer that delivers up to 30 pages per minute (ppm) in monochrome and 8 ppm in color. This is the latest addition to Lexmark's line of color lasers that includes the Lexmark C752L which was announced earlier in the quarter with print speeds up to 20 ppm in color. Also introduced in January was the Lexmark X422 multifunction laser, providing high-performance features for enhanced productivity at breakthrough affordability. Looking forward: "Looking forward to the second quarter, we believe that our strong lineup of printing solutions will keep us well-positioned for solid growth," Curlander stated. "While we continue to see some indications of market improvement, we remain cautious due to the uncertain economic environment and the potential for aggressive price competition. In the second quarter of 2004, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate of high-single to low-double digits and earnings per share to be in the range of 88 to 98 cents, versus 77 cents reported in 2003." -- more --

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibits: 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated July 19, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports second-quarter EPS growth of 32 percent Lexington, Ky., July 19, 2004 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004. Revenue of $1.248 billion grew 11 percent from a year ago and earnings per share increased 32 percent to $1.02. "Our second quarter results mark the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings growth," stated Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and CEO. "These consistent results reflect Lexmark's exclusive focus on printing solutions and the power of our supplies-driven business model." Gross profit for the quarter was $440 million or 35.3 percent of revenue versus $381 million or 34.0 percent a year ago due to improved product margins, partially offset by a negative mix among products. Operating expense for the second quarter was $254 million compared to $244 million in the same period of 2003. Operating income was $186 million or 14.9 percent of revenue versus $137 million or 12.2 percent of revenue a year earlier. Net earnings were $137 million in the second quarter, up 34 percent from $102 million reported a year ago. Diluted net earnings per share for the period were $1.02, up 32 percent from 77 cents in the prior year. Lexmark's debt-to-total-capital ratio at June 30, 2004 was 7 percent compared to 8 percent at March 31, 2004. Capital expenditures were $41 million in the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $134 million in the quarter. Lexmark repurchased 750,000 shares of its common stock during the quarter for $70 million. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $113 million as of June 30, 2004. First half 2004 financial results Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $2.504 billion, an increase of 12 percent versus $2.228 billion in the same period of 2003. Gross profit margin was 34.0 percent, up 0.9 points from the prior year. Operating income was $351 million versus $266 million a year earlier, an increase of 32 percent. Net earnings for the period grew 31 percent to $258 million versus $196 million a year ago. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.93, an increase of 29 percent over the $1.50 per share recorded in the first half of 2003. Looking forward: "As we look forward, we believe that our recent new product introductions and our business model position us well for continued growth," Curlander stated. "We continue to be cautious, however, due to the uncertainty in the market, and the potential for aggressive price competition. In the third quarter of 2004, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate of high-single to low-double digits and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00, versus 79 cents reported in the third quarter of 2003." --more--

Each Investor Agent shall promptly notify the Program Agent whether such Investor has determined to make the requested purchase on the terms specified by the Seller. The Program Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Seller whether the Investors have determined to make the requested purchase and, if so, whether all of the terms specified by the Seller are acceptable to the Investors. If any Investor has determined not to make the entire amount of a proposed purchase requested to be made by it, the Investor Agent for such Investor shall promptly send notice of the proposed purchase to all of the Related Banks for such Investor concurrently by telecopier, telex or cable specifying the date of such purchase, the aggregate amount of Capital of Receivable Interest being purchased by such Related Banks (which amount shall be equal to the portion of the initial Capital requested to be funded by such Investor, which such Investor determined not to fund), each such Related Bank's portion thereof (determined ratably in accordance with its respective Bank Commitment), whether the Yield for the Fixed Period for such Receivable Interest is calculated based on the Eurodollar Rate (which may be selected only if such notice is given at least three Business Days prior to the purchase date) or the Alternate Base Rate, and the duration of the Fixed Period for such Receivable Interest (which shall be one day if the Seller has not selected another period).

Each Bank's obligation shall be several, such that the failure of any Bank to make available to the Seller any funds in connection with any purchase shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make funds available on the date of such purchase, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make funds available in connection with any purchase. SECTION 2.03. Receivable Interest Computation. Each Receivable Interest shall be initially computed on its date of purchase. Thereafter until the Termination Date for such Receivable Interest, such Receivable Interest shall be automatically recomputed (or deemed to be recomputed) on each day other than a Liquidation Day. Any Receivable Interest, as computed (or deemed recomputed) as of the day immediately preceding the Termination Date for such Receivable Interest, shall thereafter remain constant; provided, however, that from and after the date on which the Termination Date shall have occurred for all Receivable Interests and until each Receivable Interest becomes zero in accordance with the next sentence, each Receivable Interest shall be calculated as the percentage equivalent of a fraction the numerator of which is the percentage representing such Receivable Interest immediately prior to such date and the denominator of which is the sum of the percentages representing all Receivable Interests which were outstanding immediately prior to such date.

After the occurrence and during the continuation of Level I Downgrade Event which is not a Level II Downgrade Event, on the Business Day immediately following the delivery of any Weekly Report which sets forth a Pool Non-Compliance Date as of the close of business on the last Business Day of the preceding Week, and on each Business Day thereafter until a Pool Non-Compliance Date no longer exists, the Collection Agent shall deposit into the Investor Agent's Account for each Investor Agent Collections set aside for such Investor Agent, the Investors and/or Banks in its Group pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 2.04(b), provided that the aggregate amount deposited pursuant to this sentence with respect to any Weekly Report shall not exceed an amount such that, after giving effect to the application of such amount to the reduction of Capital, the sum of the Receivable Interests is equal to 100%. The Collection Agent shall pay to itself on each Settlement Date which is not a Liquidation Day Collections set aside with respect to each Receivable Interest on account of accrued Collection Agent Fee. On any Business Day on which funds are on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account, the Collection Agent (i) shall, upon written notice from the Program Agent or any of the Investor Agents, and may (if the funds in the Cash Collateral Account exceed $10,000,000), upon written 35
notice to the Program Agent and the Investor Agents, remit such funds from the Cash Collateral Account to the Investor Agent's Account for each Investor Agent, such remittance to be applied as a reduction of Capital, or (ii) may, following delivery of the Weekly Report or Daily Report to the Program Agent, as the case may be, withdraw from the Cash Collateral Account and remit to the Seller all or a portion of the funds in the Cash Collateral Account; provided that such Weekly Report or Daily Report, as the case may be, shall state that, after taking account of the proposed withdrawal, the Net Receivables Pool Balance on such day will be equal to or greater than the Required Net Receivables Pool Balance, and such Weekly Report or such Daily Report, as the case may be, shall set forth the calculation supporting such statement. (e) Upon receipt of funds deposited into the Investor Agent's Account, the relevant Investor Agent shall distribute them as follows: (i) if such distribution occurs on a day that is not a Liquidation Day, first to the Investors or the Banks in its Group that hold the relevant Receivable Interest and to such Investor Agent in payment in full of all accrued Yield and Fees and then to the Collection Agent in payment in full of all accrued Collection Agent Fee payable by the Investors and Banks in its Group; provided, that if such distribution related to Collections remitted from the Cash Collateral Account, such distribution shall be paid to the Investors and the Banks in its Group that hold the Receivable Interest in respect thereof, in reduction of Capital. (ii) if such distribution occurs on a Liquidation Day, first to the Investors or the Banks in its Group that hold the relevant Receivable Interest and to such Investor Agent in payment in full of all accrued Yield and Fees, second to such Investors and/or Banks in reduction to zero of all Capital, third to such Investors, Banks or such Investor Agent in payment of any other amounts owed by the Seller hereunder, and fourth to the Collection Agent in payment in full of all accrued Collection Agent Fee payable by the Investors and Banks in its Group. After the Capital, Yield, Fees and Collection Agent Fee with respect to a Receivable Interest, and any other amounts payable by the Seller to the Investors, the Banks, the Investor Agents or the Program Agent hereunder, have been paid in full, all additional Collections with respect to such Receivable Interest shall be paid to the Seller for its own account. (f) For the purposes of this Section 2.04: (i) if on any day the Outstanding Balance of any Pool Receivable is reduced or adjusted as a result of any defective, rejected or returned merchandise or services, or any cash discount, discount for quick payment or other adjustment made by the Seller or the Originator, or any setoff, the Seller shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection of such Pool Receivable in the amount of such reduction or adjustment; (ii) if on any day upon each purchase or reinvestment (A) any of the representations or warranties contained in Section 4.01(h) is no longer true with respect to any Pool Receivable or (B) the Investors or the Banks, as the case may be, shall not acquire a valid and perfected first priority undivided percentage ownership interest to the extent of the pertinent Receivable Interest in each Pool Receivable then existing or thereafter arising and in the Related 36
Security and Collections with respect thereto, then the Seller shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection of such Pool Receivable in full; (iii) except as provided in subsection (i) or (ii) of this Section 2.04(f), or as otherwise required by applicable law or the relevant Contract, all Collections received from an Obligor of any Receivables shall be applied to the Receivables of such Obligor in the order of the age of such Receivables, starting with the oldest such Receivable, unless such Obligor designates its payment for application to specific Receivables; and (iv) if and to the extent the Program Agent, any of the Investor Agents, the Investors or the Banks shall be required for any reason to pay over to an Obligor any amount received on its behalf hereunder, such amount shall be deemed not to have been so received but rather to have been retained by the Seller and, accordingly, the Program Agent, such Investor Agent, the Investors or the Banks, as the case may be, shall have a claim against the Seller for such amount, payable when and to the extent that any distribution from or on behalf of such Obligor is made in respect thereof. (g) In the event that the Program Agent or any Investor Agent receives Collections in respect of any Receivable directly from an Obligor, such Agent shall, at its option, either (i) promptly forward such Collections to the Collection Agent (and the Collection Agent shall apply such Collections in accordance with this Section 2.04) or (ii) promptly apply such Collections in accordance with this Section 2.04 in the same manner that Collection Agent would apply such Collections. SECTION 2.05. Fees. (a) Each Investor and Bank shall pay to the Collection Agent a fee (the "Collection Agent Fee") of l/2 of 1% per annum on the average daily Capital of each Receivable Interest owned by such Investor or Bank, from the date of purchase of such Receivable Interest until the later of the Termination Date for such Receivable Interest or the date on which such Capital is reduced to zero, payable on the Settlement Date for such Receivable Interest. Upon three Business Days' notice to the Program Agent and each Investor Agent, the Collection Agent (if not the Originator, the Seller or its designee or an Affiliate of the Seller) may elect to be paid, as such fee, another percentage per annum on the average daily Capital of such Receivable Interest, but in no event in excess for all Receivable Interests relating to the Receivables Pool of 110% of the reasonable costs and expenses of the Collection Agent in administering and collecting the Receivables in the Receivables Pool. The Collection Agent Fee shall be payable only from Collections pursuant to, and subject to the priority of payment set forth in, Section 2.04. So long as the Originator is acting as the Collection Agent hereunder, amounts paid as the Collection Agent Fee pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the obligation of the Seller to pay the "Collection Agent Fee" pursuant to Section 6.03 of the Originator Purchase Agreement, provided that such obligation of the Seller shall in no event be reduced below zero. (b) The Seller shall pay to the Investor Agents certain fees (collectively, the "Fees") in the amounts and on the dates set forth in separate fee agreements of even date among the Seller, the Program Agent and each Investor Agent, respectively, as the same may be amended or restated from time to time (the "Fee Agreements"). 37
SECTION 2.06. Payments and Computations, Etc. (a) All amounts to be paid or deposited by the Seller or the Collection Agent hereunder shall be paid or deposited no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in same day funds to the applicable Investor Agent's Account, provided, that all amounts to be deposited into the Cash Collateral Account shall be deposited no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date when due, and in any event such amounts shall be deposited into the Cash Collateral Account prior to any withdrawal from a Lock-Box Account (other than to directly fund a deposit into the Cash Collateral Account). (b) Each of the Seller and the Collection Agent shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay interest on any amount not paid or deposited by it when due hereunder, at an interest rate per annum equal to 2.00% per annum above the Alternate Base Rate, payable on demand. (c) All computations of interest under subsection (b) above and all computations of Yield, Fees, and other amounts hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. Whenever any payment or deposit to be made hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment or deposit shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of such payment or deposit. SECTION 2.07. Dividing or Combining Receivable Interests. Either the Seller or any Investor Agent may, upon notice to the other party (with a copy of such notice to the Program Agent) received at least three Business Days prior to the last day of any Fixed Period in the case of the Seller giving notice, or up to the last day of such Fixed Period in the case of an Investor Agent giving notice, either (i) divide any portion of a Receivable Interest held by one or more Investors and/or Banks in its Group into two or more Receivable Interests of such Investors and/or Banks having aggregate Capital equal to the Capital of such divided portion of such Receivable Interest, or (ii) combine any two or more portions of Receivable Interests held by one or more Investors and/or Banks in its Group originating on such last day or having Fixed Periods ending on such last day into a single Receivable Interest having Capital equal to the aggregate of the Capital of such Receivable Interests; provided, however, that no Receivable Interest owned by CIESCO may be combined with a Receivable Interest owned by any Bank. SECTION 2.08. Increased Costs. (a) If CNAI, any Investor, any Investor Agent, any Bank, any entity (including any bank or other financial institution providing liquidity and/or credit support to any Investor in connection with such Investor's commercial paper program) which purchases or which enters into a commitment to purchase Receivable Interests or interests therein, or any of their respective Affiliates (each an "Affected Person") determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of the capital required or expected to be maintained by such Affected Person and such Affected Person determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of any commitment to make purchases of or otherwise to maintain the investment in Pool Receivables or interests therein related to this Agreement or to the funding thereof and other commitments of the same type, then, upon demand by such Affected Person (with a copy to the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group), the Seller shall 38
immediately pay to the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group for the account of such Affected Person (as a third-party beneficiary), from time to time as specified by such Affected Person, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Affected Person in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Affected Person reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of any of such commitments. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Seller and the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group by such Affected Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements referred to in Section 2.09) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Investor or Bank of agreeing to purchase or purchasing, or maintaining the ownership of Receivable Interests in respect of which Yield is computed by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, then, upon demand by such Investor or Bank (with a copy to the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Investor or such Bank), the Seller shall immediately pay to such Investor Agent, for the account of such Investor or Bank (as a third-party beneficiary), from time to time as specified by such Investor or Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Investor or Bank for such increased costs. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Seller and the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group by such Investor or Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.09. Additional Yield on Receivable Interests Bearing a Eurodollar Rate. The Seller shall pay to any Investor or Bank, so long as such Investor or Bank shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional Yield on the unpaid Capital of each Receivable Interest of such Investor or Bank during each Fixed Period relating to any portion of the Capital of such Investor or Bank in respect of which Yield is computed by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, for such Fixed Period, at a rate per annum equal at all times during such Fixed Period to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for such Fixed Period from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate referred to in clause (i) above by that percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Investor or Bank for such Fixed Period, payable on each date on which Yield is payable on such Receivable Interest. Such additional Yield shall be determined by such Investor or Bank and notice thereof given to the Seller through the Investor Agent for such Investor or Bank (with a copy to the Program Agent) within 30 days after any Yield payment is made with respect to which such additional Yield is requested. A certificate as to such additional Yield submitted to the Seller and the Program Agent by such Investor or Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.10. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments and deposits required to be made hereunder or under any other Transaction Document by the Collection Agent or the Seller shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding net income taxes that are imposed by the United States and franchise 39
taxes and net income taxes that are imposed on an Affected Person by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Affected Person is organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Seller or the Collection Agent shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Affected Person, (i) the Seller shall make an additional payment to such Affected Person, in an amount sufficient so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.10), such Affected Person receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Seller or the Collection Agent, as the case may be, shall make such deductions and (iii) the Seller or the Collection Agent, as the case may be, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Seller agrees to pay any present or future stamp or other documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any other Transaction Document or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Seller will indemnify each Affected Person for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.10) paid by such Affected Person and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within thirty days from the date the Affected Person makes written demand therefor (and a copy of such demand shall be delivered to the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group). A certificate as to the amount of such indemnification submitted to the Seller and the Program Agent and the Investor Agent for such Affected Person's Group by such Affected Person, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for and the calculation thereof, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.

Each such Affected Person shall from time to time thereafter, upon written request from the Seller, deliver to the Seller any new 40
certificates, documents or other evidence as described in the preceding sentence as will permit payments under this Agreement to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate (but only so long as such Affected Person is legally able to do so). (e) The Seller shall not be required to pay any amounts to any Affected Person in respect of Taxes and Other Taxes pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above if the obligation to pay such amounts is attributable to the failure by such Affected Person to comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) above; provided, however, that should an Affected Person become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Seller shall take such steps as such Affected Person shall reasonably request to assist such Affected Person to recover such Taxes; provided, that the Seller shall not be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses for complying with the previous proviso.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated October 18, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark International reports third-quarter operating income growth of 31 percent Lexington, Ky., Oct. 18, 2004 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2004. Third quarter revenue was $1.266 billion, an increase of 9 percent compared to $1.157 billion last year. Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter were $1.17 and include a non-recurring benefit of 15 cents per share from the resolution of income tax matters. Without this tax benefit, earnings per share would have been $1.02, an increase of 29 percent compared to a year ago. "Lexmark continued to perform well with 9 percent overall revenue growth and 31 percent operating income growth," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. "This was driven by double-digit unit growth in both our business and consumer segments, despite encountering weaker market conditions than we had anticipated." Gross profit margin was 35.2 percent for the quarter versus 32.1 percent a year ago due to improved product margins. Operating expenses were $262 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. Operating income margin improved 2.5 points to 14.6 percent in the third quarter of 2004 versus last year. Diluted net earnings per share for the period were $1.17 compared to 79 cents a year earlier. Net cash provided by operating activities was $205 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $56 million. Lexmark repurchased 850,000 shares of its common stock during the quarter for $73 million. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $40 million as of Sept. 30, 2004. Lexmark announces powerful, easy-to-use new products In the third quarter, as part of Lexmark's strategic initiative to expand into additional growth segments, Lexmark announced its new line of photo printers with the launch of two new photo inkjet products in September, followed by an additional product announcement today.

As part of Lexmark's growth initiative to expand its presence in the small and medium business market, Lexmark announced in the third quarter a new business inkjet product and an additional laser product today.

The Lexmark X830e priced at $11,999, and the Lexmark X832e priced at $13,999 offer the award winning, customizable e-Task touch screen user interface making common applications like scan-to-e-mail and scan-to-file as easy as making a copy. In addition to providing workgroup print, copy, scan, and fax capabilities, these products will serve as application platforms for improving paper-intensive workflow processes in large corporations. Nine-month financial results Revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2004 was $3.770 billion, an increase of 11 percent versus $3.385 billion in the same period of 2003. Gross profit margin was 34.4 percent, up 1.7 points from the prior year. Operating income was $535 million versus $406 million a year earlier, an increase of 32 percent. Net earnings per share on a diluted basis for the period were $3.10. Excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, earnings per share would have been $2.95, up 29 percent compared to $2.29 per share recorded in the same period of 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months was $491 million. Looking forward Due to recent U.S. legislation extending corporate research and development tax credits and an extension of a non-U.S. tax holiday, the company's full year 2004 tax rate will be adjusted from 27.5 percent to 26.5 percent in the fourth quarter. This is expected to provide a benefit to fourth-quarter earnings of about 5 cents per share. Additionally, as part of Lexmark's strategic initiative to improve brand awareness, the company is increasing its marketing spending to support a new advertising campaign. This spending is expected to negatively impact fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 7 to 8 cents per share both sequentially and year-over-year. "Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we believe the strength of our product lineup and supplies-driven business model will keep us well-positioned for continued growth," Curlander said. "Nevertheless, we continue to be cautious due to uncertainty in the market and the potential for aggressive price competition. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate of mid- to high-single digits and earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15 including the effect of the tax benefits and the projected increase in marketing expenses. This compares to earnings per share of $1.05 in the same quarter a year ago." ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Monday, Oct. 18, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (888-338-6461).

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "company"), entered into a $300 million 5-year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on and effective as of January 20, 2005 (the "Effective Date") by and among the company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Fleet National Bank and Citibank, N.A. as Co-Syndication Agents, KeyBank National Association and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a 5-year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility that includes the availability of swingline loans and multicurrency letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $500 million. Interest on all borrowings under the Credit Agreement is determined based upon several alternative interest rates, including a rate based on LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including those relating to (a) a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA/consolidated interest expense) of not less than 4.0 : 1.0 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness/consolidated EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 : 1.0. The Credit Agreement limits, among other things, the company's indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business. The Credit Agreement includes usual and customary events of default (subject to applicable grace periods) for facilities of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments shall automatically terminate. As of the Effective Date, there are no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K. The Credit Agreement replaces the company's current $300 million 3-year Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into on May 29, 2002 by the company and Fleet National Bank, as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank and Citicorp USA, Inc. as Co-Syndication Agents, Key Corporate Capital Inc. and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto (the "Fleet Credit Agreement"), which agreement was terminated on and effective as of the Effective Date of the Credit Agreement. The Fleet Credit Agreement allowed for swingline loans and the issuance of multicurrency letters of credit under the credit facility. Interest on all borrowings was determined based upon several alternative rates, including a rate based on LIBOR. The Fleet
Credit Agreement contained certain financial covenants, including those relating to the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.

"Adjusted LIBO Rate" means, with respect to any Eurocurrency Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100 of 1%) equal to the sum of (i) (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate plus, without duplication, (ii) in the case of Loans by a Lender from its office or branch in England, the Mandatory Cost. "Administrative Agent" means JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder. "Administrative Questionnaire" means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent. "Affiliate" means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified. "Aggregate Commitment" means the aggregate of the Commitments of all of the Lenders, as reduced or increased from time to time pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. As of the Effective Date, the Aggregate Commitment is $300,000,000. "Agreed Currencies" means (i) Dollars, (ii) euro, (iii) British Pounds Sterling and (iv) Japanese Yen. "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%.

"Applicable Percentage" means, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment represented by such Lender's Commitment. If the Commitments have terminated or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon the Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments.

system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01 or otherwise and (v) if the Borrower shall not have any Index Debt outstanding, then issuer ratings by Moody's and S&P for the Borrower shall apply for items (i) through (iv) above. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

(b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith; provided that each ABR Loan shall only be made in Dollars. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan.

SECTION 2.03. Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or four Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency), in each case before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.06(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable subject to Section 2.21 and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; (iv) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Agreed Currency and initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.07. If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. SECTION 2.04. Determination of Dollar Amounts. The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Amount of: (a) each Eurocurrency Borrowing as of the date three Business Days prior to the date of such Borrowing or, if applicable, date of conversion/continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (b) the LC Exposure as of the date of each request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit, and 19
(c) all outstanding Credit Events on and as of the last Business Day of each calendar month and, during the continuation of an Event of Default, on any other Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders. Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) is herein described as a "Computation Date" with respect to each Credit Event for which a Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day. SECTION 2.05. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $50,000,000 or (ii) the Dollar Amount of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the Aggregate Commitment; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the 20
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. SECTION 2.06. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in Agreed Currencies for its own account or the account of one or more Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the Agreed Currency applicable thereto, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and (iii) subject to Section 2.04, the Dollar Amount of the total Revolving Credit Exposures denominated in Foreign Currencies shall not exceed the Foreign Currency Sublimit. 21
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if the Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Borrower, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by the Issuing Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, such payment shall, automatically and without any notice, be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing (or, if so requested by the Borrower, a Swingline Loan) in an equivalent Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement and the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due and, for any reason, the applicable Lender(s) are unable to make or have no obligation to make the ABR Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan (as applicable) contemplated in the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made 22
by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Borrower's reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable exchange rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement. (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) whether the account party in respect of such LC Disbursement is the Borrower or any Subsidiary or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such 23
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, at the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate for such Agreed Currency plus the then effective Applicable Rate with respect to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans); provided that, if the Issuing Bank provides timely notice to the Borrower of such reimbursement obligation as specified by paragraph (e) of this Section and the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to such paragraph (e), then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 24
(j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in a Foreign Currency that the Borrower is not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in the applicable Foreign Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Foreign Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the applicable exchange rates of the Administrative Agent on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the Borrower. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11.2. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. (k) Conversion. In the event that the Loans become immediately due and payable on any date pursuant to Article VII, all amounts (i) that the Borrower is at the time or thereafter becomes required to reimburse or otherwise pay to the Administrative Agent in respect of LC Disbursements made under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts in respect of which the Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to paragraph (j) above, if such cash collateral was deposited in the applicable Foreign Currency to the extent so deposited or applied), (ii) that the Lenders are at the time or thereafter become required to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter becomes required to distribute to the Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section in respect of unreimbursed LC Disbursements made under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) of each Lender's participation in any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit under which an LC Disbursement has been made shall, automatically and with no further action required, be 25
converted into the Dollar Amount, calculated using the Administrative Agent's currency exchange rates on such date (or in the case of any LC Disbursement made after such date, on the date such LC Disbursement is made), of such amounts. On and after such conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of the obligations described in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder. SECTION 2.07. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders and (ii) in the case of each Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, by 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and at such Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the equivalent Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. If any interest is paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07 with respect to any amount funded by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall not be required to pay interest on such amount pursuant to this Agreement to the relevant non-funding Lender in respect of such period SECTION 2.08. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect 26
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless (x) such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative 27
Agent an Interest Election Request requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Borrowing continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for the same or another Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. SECTION 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Dollar Amount of the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the Aggregate Commitment. (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 28
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class, Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered and permitted assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. SECTION 2.11.1. Voluntary Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, at least one Business Day before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a 29
Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13. SECTION 2.11.2. Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time, (i) other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures (calculated, with respect to those Credit Events denominated in Foreign Currencies, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Credit Event) exceeds the Aggregate Commitment and (ii) solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures (as so calculated) exceeds 5% of the Foreign Currency Sublimit, the Borrower shall immediately repay Borrowings and, if no Borrowings are then outstanding, cash collateralize LC Disbursements in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j), in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess. SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily Dollar Amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily Dollar Amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily Dollar Amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.10% per annum on the average daily Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's reasonable and customary fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and 30
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the rate offered by the Swingline Lender and accepted by the Borrower. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest (i) computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 31
days (or 366 days in a leap year), (ii) for Swingline Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (iii) for Borrowings denominated in British Pounds Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted. SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing 32
denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowing denominated in any other Agreed Currency) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency into a Borrowingdenominated in any other Agreed Currency), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided, however that at such time such Lender or Issuing Bank shall be generally assessing such amounts on a non-discriminatory basis against borrowers under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 2.15. (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided, however that at such time such Lender or Issuing Bank shall be generally assessing such amounts on a non-discriminatory basis against borrowers under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 2.15. (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 60 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable 33
thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss and any reasonable cost and expense attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower 34
by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 2:00 p.m., Local Time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in a Foreign Currency, 2:00 p.m., Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to euro, in euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 131 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments 35
pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the "Original Currency") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the 36
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline 37
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 2.20. Increase of Commitments. At any time, the Borrower may request that Aggregate Commitment be increased; provided that, without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders, the Aggregate Commitment shall at no time exceed $500,000,000. Such request shall be made in a written notice given to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the proposed effective date of such increase, which notice (a "Commitment Increase Notice") shall specify the amount of the proposed increase in the Aggregate Commitment and the proposed effective date of such increase. The Borrower may notify the Administrative Agent of any financial institution that shall have agreed to become a "Lender" party hereto (a "Proposed New Lender") in connection with the Commitment Increase Notice and any Proposed New Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders on or before the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed effective date of the amount of each Lender's and Proposed New Lender's Commitment (the "Effective Commitment Amount") and the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, which amount shall be effective on the following Business Day. Any increase in the Aggregate Commitment shall be subject to the following conditions precedent: (A) as of the date of the Commitment Increase Notice and as of the proposed effective date of the increase in the Aggregate Commitment, all representations and warranties under Article III shall be true and correct in all material respects as though made on such date (except for representations and warranties for which exceptions thereto have been disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and which have been approved in writing by the Required Lenders or expressly relate to an earlier specified date) and no event shall have occurred and then be continuing which constitutes a Default or Event of Default, (B) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Proposed New Lender or Lender that shall have agreed to provide a "Commitment" in support of such increase in the Aggregate Commitment shall have executed and delivered a "Commitment and Acceptance" substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, (C) counsel for the Borrower shall have provided to the Administrative Agent supplemental opinions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (D) the Borrower and the Proposed New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments and documents as may be required under Article IV or that the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested in connection with such increase and (E) the Administrative Agent shall have administered the reallocation of the Revolving Credit Exposures on the effective date of such increase ratably among the Lenders (including new Lenders) after giving effect to such increase. The Borrower hereby agrees to compensate each Lender for all losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by such Lender, if any, in connection with the sale and assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan hereunder on the terms and in the manner as set forth in Section 2.16 hereof. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to any increase in the Aggregate Commitment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Borrower and 38
each Lender of the effective date of such increase. Upon the effective date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment that is supported by a Proposed New Lender, such Proposed New Lender shall be a party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment at any time. SECTION 2.21. Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article II and Article IV with respect to any Credit Event to be effected in any Foreign Currency, if (i) there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Credit Event any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank (if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit) or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Borrowings or Letters of Credit comprising such Credit Event to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrower or (ii) an Equivalent Amount of such currency is not readily calculable, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower, the Lenders and, if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank at least (to the extent practicable) two Business Days prior to such Credit Event, and such Credit Events shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.07, be made on the date of such Credit Event in Dollars, (a) if such Credit Event is a Borrowing, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Credit Event Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be, as ABR Loans, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Credit Event Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be or (b) if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit, in a face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the face amount specified in the related request or application for such Letter of Credit, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to request the issuance of such Letter of Credit on such date or (ii) it elects to have such Letter of Credit issued on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Letter of Credit would in the reasonable opinion of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in a face amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the face amount specified in the related request or application for such Letter of Credit, as the case may be. SECTION 2.22. Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than 39
the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.18, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower. ARTICLE III Representations and Warranties The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that: SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers; Subsidiaries. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

(b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) Except for the Disclosed Matters, there are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the Loan Documents contain any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. SECTION 3.12. Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loan have been used or will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of Regulations T, U and X of the Board. SECTION 3.13. No Default. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. ARTICLE IV Conditions SECTION 4.01. Effective Date. The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which each of the following conditions is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 9.02): (a) The Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received from each party hereto either (i) a counterpart of this Agreement signed on behalf of such party or (ii) 42

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall not become effective unless each of the foregoing conditions is satisfied (or waived pursuant to Section 9.02) at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date (and, in the event such conditions are not so satisfied or waived, the Commitments shall terminate at such time).

ARTICLE V Affirmative Covenants Until the Commitments have expired or been terminated and the principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that: SECTION 5.01.

SECTION 5.07. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property (including without limitation Environmental Laws), except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VIII The Administrative Agent Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or 53
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required in the event a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its 54
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Co-Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their capacity as Co-Syndication Agents or Co-Documentation Agents as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.

(c) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent 56
of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 15 days after written demand therefor. SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns.

(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" has the following meaning: "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such 59
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any 60
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall 61
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.

(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to 62

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated January 24, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark International completes year with 28 percent EPS growth o Revenue and EPS records set for quarter and full year. o Sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit hardware revenue growth achieved. o Annual hardware revenue growth of 14 percent is the highest since 1998. Lexington, Ky., Jan. 24, 2005 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2004. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.544 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to $1.370 billion last year. Laser and inkjet printer revenue increased 16 percent year over year and revenue from laser and inkjet supplies was up 13 percent. Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter were $1.18, up 12 percent compared to $1.05 in the same quarter last year. "We are pleased to deliver record revenue and earnings that exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. "This was a very good quarter for Lexmark. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in both hardware and supplies. Most importantly, we continued disciplined investment in our core strategic development and marketing initiatives to drive future growth, and delivered a 28 percent year-to-year increase in EPS for the full year." Gross profit margin was 32.0 percent for the quarter versus 31.9 percent a year ago. An increase in the mix of printers was offset by improved product margins. Operating expenses, which included an approximate $15 million increase in advertising, were $297 million compared with $249 million in the prior year. Operating income was a record $197 million, up from $188 million last year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $284 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $79 million. Lexmark repurchased 1,620,000 shares of its common stock during the quarter for $139 million. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $901 million at year-end. New multifunction products are fast, flexible, easy to use Earlier this month, Lexmark announced three new powerful multifunction products that give businesses the ability to move documents seamlessly from paper to digital formats. The Lexmark X634e and Lexmark X634dte with estimated street prices of $2,899 and $3,699 respectively, deliver up to 45 page per minute performance and an easy-to-use color touch-screen display at a fraction of the cost of larger departmental devices. The
compact Lexmark X632s with print speeds of up to 40 pages per minute is perfect for small enterprise workgroups and is affordably priced at $1,999. Full-year financial results Revenue for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004 was $5.314 billion, an increase of 12 percent versus $4.755 billion in the same period of 2003. Gross profit margin was 33.7 percent, up 1.2 points from the prior year. Operating income was $732 million versus $594 million a year earlier, an increase of 23 percent. Net earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 28 percent in 2004 to $4.28. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year was $775 million. Full-year capital expenditures were $198 million. The company repurchased 3,220,000 shares in 2004 for $281 million. Looking forward In the first quarter of 2005, the company expects a year-over-year revenue growth rate of mid- to high-single digits and earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05. This compares to earnings per share of $0.91 in the same quarter a year ago. The company believes that the strength of its product line and its supplies-driven business model will keep it well positioned for continued growth, however uncertainty in the economy and the potential for aggressive price competition continue. ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Monday, Jan. 24, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (888-338-6461).

Under this program, certain executives, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for a cash award at the end of the three-year cycle based on the achievement of the financial objectives.

1 Exhibit 10.1 Lexmark International, Inc. 2005-2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan Agreement This 2005-2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2005-2007 LTIP") agreement between Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the person specified on the signature page (the "Participant") is entered into as of February 9, 2005. This agreement is only a summary of the principal terms governing the 2005-2007 LTIP. The 2005-2007 LTIP is subject to the terms of the Lexmark International, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated April 30, 2003 (the "Plan"). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this 2005-2007 LTIP agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. It is important that the Participant read and understand the Plan and not rely solely on the brief description that follows. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan. Overview - -------- The 2005-2007 LTIP is designed to reward the achievement of specific financial performance objectives over a three-year period. The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") established the financial performance objectives and financial performance measures set forth below for the performance period beginning January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2007 (the "Performance Period"). Depending upon the Company's attainment of the financial performance objectives and certain financial performance measures of the Company's peers, the Participant may be eligible to receive a payment under the 2005-2007 LTIP, as set forth below. Plan Measurements - ----------------- For the Performance Period, the Committee has established the following cumulative financial performance measures based on the Company's strategic plan for the Performance Period: [Performance Measures - Revenue, Operating Income and Cash Cycle Days] 1
At the end of the three-year Performance Period, there is an additional calculation comparing the Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Earnings Per Share ("EPS") for the Company with that of its peer companies over the same three-year period. The calculation of the Company's ROIC will be based upon Net Income before extraordinary items. The Company's EPS calculation will reflect the compound annual growth rate in EPS over the Performance Period (e.g., fiscal year 2007 EPS vs. fiscal year 2004 EPS) and will be based on EPS before extraordinary items. If the Company's ROIC and EPS are both at or above each of the median averages of the ROIC and EPS of the peer companies included in three market indices (the S&P Technology Index, the S&P 500 Index, and the Russell 1000 Index, or, in the event that any of such indices are no longer available, such other index or indices as determined to be appropriate by the Committee at the time in its sole discretion), the 2005-2007 LTIP will be funded at the Minimum level regardless of any below-Minimum attainment for the three financial performance measures. The EPS calculation for peer companies included in the market indices referenced above will exclude the use of peer companies with negative base years. The Committee may use negative discretion in determining any payment to Participants under the 2005-2007 LTIP based on the Company's ROIC and EPS compared to those of its peer companies over the Performance Period, or other factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances. Target Opportunity - ------------------ The 2005-2007 LTIP awards are denominated in cash but may be paid in cash, stock or a combination of cash and Company Class A Common Stock in the Committee's sole discretion. For the Performance Period, your target award is _____________. The chart below and the examples in Attachment A illustrate how the 2005-2007 LTIP awards will be calculated. It should be noted that the level of attainment for the Operating Income objective serves as a multiplier applied to the part of the award based on level of attainment for the Revenue objective. As a result, Revenue and Operating Income are linked and effectively require that the attainment levels for both financial performance measures be at or above Minimum level to generate a payment for these achievements. The Cash Cycle objective is not similarly linked. 2
Payout Timing - ------------- The Committee intends to review and approve the Company's business results as compared to the 2005-2007 LTIP financial performance measures and the Company's business results compared to the peer companies included in the indices stated above following the end of the three-year Performance Period. These reviews are expected to occur in a mid-year 2008 Committee meeting and payments will made only after the Committee approval has occurred. Termination of Employment - ------------------------- Except in the event of the death, long-term disability or retirement of the Participant, the Participant must be employed at the end of the Performance Period (December 31, 2007) to receive a payout. If the Participant should die, become long-term disabled or retire during the Performance Period, the payout, if any is achieved based on actual financial performance of the Company and its peers over the Performance Period, will be prorated and paid out after the end of the Performance Period. Forfeiture of the Award - ----------------------- The Participant acknowledges that this opportunity for a long-term incentive award has been granted as an incentive to the Participant to remain employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to exert his or her best efforts to enhance the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries over the long-term. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that if he or she (a) within 12 months of termination of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries accepts employment with a competitor of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise engages in competition with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (b) within 36 months of termination of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, acts against the interests of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, including recruiting or employing, or encouraging or assisting the Participant's new employer to recruit or employ, any employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries without the Company's prior written consent, or (c) discloses or otherwise misuses confidential information or material of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, each of these constituting a harmful action, then the Participant shall repay to the Company the amount of the award received under the terms and conditions of the 2005-2007 LTIP. The Committee shall have the right not to enforce the provisions of this paragraph with respect to the Participant. 3
Interpretation; Construction - ---------------------------- All powers and authority conferred upon the Committee pursuant to any term of the Plan or the 2005-2007 LTIP shall be exercised by the Committee, in its discretion. All determinations, interpretations or other actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan or the 2005-2007 LTIP shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Committee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel. Amendment - --------- The Committee shall have the right to alter or amend the 2005-2007 LTIP, from time to time, as provided in the Plan in any manner for the purpose of promoting the objectives of the Plan, provided that no such amendment shall impair the Participant's rights under the 2005-2007 LTIP without the Participant's consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, any alteration or amendment to the 2005-2007 LTIP by the Committee shall, upon adoption by the Committee, become and be binding and conclusive. The Company shall give written notice to the Participant of any such alteration or amendment of the 2005-2007 LTIP as promptly as practical after the adoption. This 2005-2007 LTIP agreement may also be amended in writing signed by both an authorized representative of the Company and the Participant. No Guarantee of Employment or Future Incentive Awards - ----------------------------------------------------- Nothing in the Plan or the 2005-2007 LTIP shall be deemed to: (a) interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause; (b) confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary; and (c) provide Participant the right to receive any Incentive Awards under the Plan in the future or any other benefits the Company may provide to some or all of its employees. 4
Applicable Law - -------------- The 2005-2007 LTIP and this 2005-2007 LTIP agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflict of laws and excluding any conflict or choice of law rule or principle that may otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the 2005-2007 LTIP or this 2005-2007 LTIP agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Please sign and date this agreement to acknowledge that you have read the terms of this agreement and understand that this 2005-2007 LTIP award is subject to the provisions of the Plan and that you agree to the terms and conditions contained herein and therein.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated April 26, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports record revenue and EPS for first quarter o Supplies sales drive growth o Strong laser printer sales in the quarter o Company repurchases a record $227 million of its common stock Lexington, Ky., April 26, 2005 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2005. First quarter revenue was $1.358 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared to $1.256 billion last year. EPS were $0.96 and would have been $0.99 without the items described below. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the first quarter as a result of aggressive pricing and soft consumer market demand. "Our revenue growth in the quarter was driven mainly by supplies, reflecting the consistency of our business model, and also by strong demand for our laser printers. We continued our increased investments in R&D and branding in the first quarter in support of our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. First quarter operating income includes a $9.6 million, or 5 cents per share, charge which represents management's best estimate of probable losses relating to 2002 through 2004 accounts receivable in Spain due to inappropriate conduct by a former employee of Lexmark Spain. Also included in earnings per share is a benefit of 2 cents from the retroactive extension of a favorable non-U.S. tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter were a record $0.96. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been $0.99, up from $0.91 in the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin was 33.0 percent for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement compared to 32.7 percent a year ago. Operating expenses were 21.0 percent of revenue, up from 19.6 percent in the prior year, driven by the charge and continued strategic investments in development and marketing. Operating income was $161.7 million compared to $165.2 million last year. Excluding the charge, operating income would have been a record $171.3 million. Lexmark repurchased a record $227 million of its common stock during the quarter. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $675 million at
quarter-end. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million. Lexmark increases participation in photo printing with new All-In-Ones In keeping with its strategy to increase participation in high-growth segments such as inkjet photo printing, the company today announced two inkjet All-In-One (AIO) products that print, copy, scan, and make printing digital photos easy. Affordably priced to appeal to a broad group of consumers at $79 after rebate and $129 respectively, the Lexmark X3350 and the Lexmark P4350 are both equipped with embedded pictbridge support that make it fast and simple to print borderless 4x6 prints directly from a digital camera. The Lexmark P4350 also features photo card slots and a 1.7 inch color LCD screen, an industry first for sub-$150 AIOs. Looking forward In the second quarter of 2005, the company expects a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the mid-single digit range and earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.11, compared to $1.02 in the same quarter a year ago. The company believes that the appeal and ease of use of its product line and the strength of its supplies-driven business model will contribute to future growth. However, the potential for weakening market demand and for aggressive price competition continue. During the second quarter, the company will be evaluating a plan to repatriate funds under the American Jobs Creation Act. If implemented to the maximum, it would result in repatriation of $684 million of dividends during 2005 with a tax cost of up to $70 million, which would be included in the company's second quarter results. The impact of this repatriation is not included in the company's guidance. ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Lexmark P4350 also features photo card slots and a 1.7 inch color LCD screen, an industry first for sub-$150 AIOs. Looking forward In the second quarter of 2005, the company expects a year-over-year revenue growth rate in the mid-single digit range and earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.11, compared to $1.02 in the same quarter a year ago. The company believes that the appeal and ease of use of its product line and the strength of its supplies-driven business model will contribute to future growth. However, the potential for weakening market demand and for aggressive price competition continue. During the second quarter, the company will be evaluating a plan to repatriate funds under the American Jobs Creation Act. If implemented to the maximum, it would result in repatriation of $684 million of dividends during 2005 with a tax cost of up to $70 million, which would be included in the company's second quarter results. The impact of this repatriation is not included in the company's guidance. ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated April 26, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports record revenue and EPS for first quarter o Supplies sales drive growth o Strong laser printer sales in the quarter o Company repurchases a record $227 million of its common stock Lexington, Ky., April 26, 2005 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced record financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2005. First quarter revenue was $1.358 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared to $1.256 billion last year. EPS were $0.96 and would have been $0.99 without the items described below. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the first quarter as a result of aggressive pricing and soft consumer market demand. "Our revenue growth in the quarter was driven mainly by supplies, reflecting the consistency of our business model, and also by strong demand for our laser printers. We continued our increased investments in R&D and branding in the first quarter in support of our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. First quarter operating income includes a $9.6 million, or 5 cents per share, charge which represents management's best estimate of probable losses relating to 2002 through 2004 accounts receivable in Spain due to inappropriate conduct by a former employee of Lexmark Spain. Also included in earnings per share is a benefit of 2 cents from the retroactive extension of a favorable non-U.S. tax rate. Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter were a record $0.96. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been $0.99, up from $0.91 in the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin was 33.0 percent for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement compared to 32.7 percent a year ago. Operating expenses were 21.0 percent of revenue, up from 19.6 percent in the prior year, driven by the charge and continued strategic investments in development and marketing. Operating income was $161.7 million compared to $165.2 million last year. Excluding the charge, operating income would have been a record $171.3 million. Lexmark repurchased a record $227 million of its common stock during the quarter. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $675 million at
quarter-end. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million. Lexmark increases participation in photo printing with new All-In-Ones In keeping with its strategy to increase participation in high-growth segments such as inkjet photo printing, the company today announced two inkjet All-In-One (AIO) products that print, copy, scan, and make printing digital photos easy.

ITEM 2.05 COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES As part of the company's ongoing optimization of its expense structure, the company continually reviews its resources in light of a variety of factors.

The company expects that this workforce reduction will result in pre-tax charges of $26 million. Estimated annual savings from this reduction in employment are expected to be about $23 million. The pre-tax charges in the third quarter are expected to be approximately $13 million, with an impact on diluted net earnings per share of approximately 8 cents. The text of the press release announcing the workforce reduction is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit 99.1 Press Release issued by Lexmark International, Inc., dated July 26, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Lexmark reports second quarter financial results o Supplies sales continued to drive growth in the second quarter o Lexmark delivered double-digit unit growth in both laser and inkjet shipments o Cash generation for the second quarter increased to $146 million o Company repurchased a record $368 million of its shares in the quarter, a record $595 million in the first half Lexington, Ky., July 26, 2005 - Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2005. Second quarter revenue was $1.283 billion compared to $1.248 billion last year, an increase of 3 percent driven by 9 percent growth of laser and inkjet supplies revenue. EPS were $0.64 and would have been $1.06, up 4 percent without the tax cost of $53 million, or $0.42 per share, resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. "Despite difficult market conditions that impacted our revenue growth, we grew laser and inkjet units each at a double-digit rate in the second quarter," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. "We also increased our cash generation in the quarter to $146 million which again demonstrates the strength of our business model." Gross profit margin of 34.6 percent for the quarter compares to 35.3 percent last year, down 70 basis points due to lower product margins, somewhat offset by a higher mix of supplies. Operating expenses were 20.9 percent of revenue, up from 20.4 percent in the prior year, driven by increased strategic investments in development and marketing. Second quarter operating income margin was 13.7 percent versus 14.9 percent in the same quarter last year. Lexmark repurchased a record $368 million of its common stock during the quarter. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $307 million at quarter-end. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities increased to $146 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $56 million. "The distributed printing market presents attractive growth opportunities for Lexmark. In the quarter, we continued our R&D and marketing investments focused on
driving the long-term growth of the company. Our objective is to expand our product line to enter and increase our presence in the future growth segments. We are also focused on increasing the awareness of Lexmark, and developing our brand. We started this in 2004, and have continued these initiatives in 2005," said Curlander. As part of the company's ongoing optimization of its expense structure, Lexmark also announced today that it will reduce its workforce by approximately 275 employees through the first half of 2006 with a majority of the affected employees exiting in the third quarter of 2005. This program is expected to result in pre-tax charges of $26 million. On an annual basis this reduction is expected to make $23 million available to reinvest in the company's strategic initiatives. The pre-tax charges in the third quarter are expected to be approximately $13 million, with an impact on diluted net earnings per share of approximately 8 cents. Lexmark continues to "uncomplicate" distributed printing During the second quarter, Lexmark introduced new inkjet and laser products that reflect its continuing focus on uncomplicating distributed printing and making it easier for users to get things done. o The Lexmark X2350 and Z735 inkjet products feature the new one-cartridge inkjet platform. Consumer focus group testing showed that single printhead products were strongly favored over competitive products with multiple printheads or multiple tank systems due to the simplicity and ease of use of having to replace only one consumable part number. o The Lexmark C920 color laser, the Lexmark W840 wide format mono laser, and the Lexmark T640 family of mono laser products feature Lexmark's new, easy to use workgroup printer user interface. This interface features an expanded display and a numeric keypad that enables the user to execute easy to use industry specific customized workflow solutions that previously were only available on higher priced multifunction devices. The user interface also features a direct USB connection that allows direct printing of PDF files from flash memory devices. Users can quickly and easily print documents PC free by walking up to the printer and inserting their memory device. Lexmark expanding solutions and manufacturing capabilities In order to drive the long-term growth of the company, Lexmark continued to expand its solutions and manufacturing capabilities around the world during the second quarter. o Lexmark opened three new Printing and Solutions Showcase centers - Mexico City, New York, and Sydney. Each center provides an environment for customers to experience first-hand how Lexmark can help large enterprise customers from a number of different industries improve their paper intensive workflow processes. o Lexmark opened its fifth manufacturing facility in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. This new facility will produce laser toner cartridges and their components used in the company's laser products. First half financial results Revenue for the first six months of 2005 was $2.641 billion, an increase of 5 percent versus $2.504 billion in the same period of 2004. Gross profit margin was 33.8 percent compared to 34.0 percent in the first half of last year. Operating income margin was 12.8
percent versus 14.0 percent in the first half of 2004. EPS were $1.60 for the first half ($2.00 excluding a $0.02 tax benefit in the first quarter, and the $0.42 tax cost in the second quarter). EPS were $1.93 for the same period last year. In the first half of 2005 net cash provided by operating activities reached $224 million, and share repurchases were a record $595 million. Looking forward Looking forward, the company believes its newly announced products and its continued investments in its strategic initiatives position it well for future growth. However the company remains cautious due to uncertain market conditions and the potential for aggressive price competition. In the third quarter of 2005, the company expects a low-single digit year-over-year revenue growth rate. It expects earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05 excluding the estimated third quarter impact from the workforce reduction. Third quarter 2004 earnings per share were $1.17 ($1.02 excluding a $0.15 benefit from the resolution of income tax matters). ### Lexmark is hosting a conference call with securities analysts on Tuesday, July 26, 2005, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Exhibit 99.1
Lexmark revises financial outlook
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
Oct 4
, 2005
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced that financial results for its third quarter of 2005 will be lower than expected.
Although based on partial data for the quarter, the company now expects its third quarter revenue to decline 4 to 5 percent year over year. It expects its earnings to be $0.40 to $0.50 per share, excluding the estimated third quarter impact of the previously announced workforce reduction. This compares to the guidance it provided for the third quarter on July 26, 2005, of low-single digit revenue growth and earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05. The cost of the workforce reduction in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $0.05 per share.
As compared to the companys guidance for the third quarter, lower laser and inkjet supplies revenue was the main driver of the overall revenue shortfall. The lower than anticipated laser and inkjet supplies revenue was due to a reduction in channel inventories, and to lower end user demand. Laser and inkjet printer revenue was less than expected due to more aggressive product pricing and promotion and slower demand. Earnings per share results are being negatively impacted by the revenue shortfall.
 
Looking ahead, the company expects these same factors to impact the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2005, although the analysis is not yet complete, the company currently expects revenue and earnings per share to be significantly below the current average of analysts expectations. The company will provide updated guidance for the fourth quarter when it releases its third quarter earnings on October 25.
Conference Call
The company will be hosting a conference call with securities analysts today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A live broadcast and a complete replay of this call can be accessed from Lexmarks investor relations Web site at http://investor.lexmark.com.

Upon completion of this conference call, the company will have no further comment on its third-quarter results or fourth-quarter guidance until its earnings announcement on Tuesday, October 25, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Lexmark announces third quarter results
 
- Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for its third quarter of 2005.
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
Oct 25
, 2005
Third quarter revenue was $1.22 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year, a decline of 4 percent. GAAP earnings per share were $0.59 compared to $1.17 last year. EPS in the third quarter of 2005 were $0.59 excluding third quarter costs of $0.05 per share from the previously announced workforce reduction which were offset by a $0.05 per share benefit from a decrease in the effective annual tax rate. EPS in the third quarter last year would have been $1.02 excluding a $0.15 per share benefit from the resolution of income tax matters in 2004.
While these near-term results are significantly less than we expected at the start of the third quarter, we are focused on strengthening the company for the long term. This is why we reduced prices in the third quarter to improve our hardware competitiveness and drive future sales of hardware and supplies. Our announcement yesterday of new color and mono lasers continues to strengthen our competitiveness. In addition, we are continuing our investments in the Lexmark brand, and in new products and technology to provide a strong pipeline of future products, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
Laser and inkjet printer revenue was down 10 percent year-over-year due to more aggressive pricing and promotional activities, and weak demand. Laser and inkjet supplies revenue was up 1 percent year over year. This slower-than-anticipated growth in supplies revenue was due to changes in channel inventories and soft end-user demand for both laser and inkjet supplies.
Gross profit margin was 29.4 percent compared to 35.2 percent in the same period last year mostly driven by lower hardware margins. Operating expenses were 22.6 percent versus 20.7 percent last year driven by a decline in revenue year to year, increased investments in research and development, and workforce reduction costs.
Third-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $131 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million, and Lexmark repurchased $275 million of its stock during the quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was $531 million at quarter end.
New products deliver value, ease-of-use
Yesterday, Lexmark announced powerful, affordable new color and monochrome laser products, strengthening its position in the small and medium business and enterprise markets. The versatile Lexmark C520 family of color laser printers will allow customers to expand their color printing capabilities with fast color output, while managing print costs with Lexmarks Color Care Technology tools for saving toner, authorizing the use of color printing, and estimating the cost of color per page. The C520n and the C522n models deliver the fastest rated color speed in the market for color lasers priced below $500. Also announced yesterday was the new Lexmark E-series line of low-end mono lasers, with its small, compact design and maximum print speeds of up to 30 pages per minute. Among the ease-of-use features on the Lexmark E-series printers are easy toner cartridge installation, a graphics-enhanced print driver, and on the E340 and E342n, an LCD operator panel with easy-to-understand messages.
During the quarter, at the higher end of the laser line, the Lexmark C920 color laser received a Five-Star Exceptional Rating from BERTL, and Highly Recommended/Highly Reliable recognition from Buyers Laboratory, Inc. These are the highest forms of recognition from each publication. The Lexmark T640n workgroup mono laser was recently named Editors Choice by PC magazine.
In September, Lexmark strengthened its position in the photo market with the announcement of the Lexmark P450. This 4x6-inch photo printer features the industrys first built-in CD photo burner, which gives users a complete PC-free photo processing center and easy-to-use digital imaging archiving system.
Year-to-date Financial Results
Revenue for the first nine months ending September 30, 2005, was $3.86 billion, up 2 percent compared to the same period last year. Gross profit margin was 32.4 percent, compared to 34.4 percent a year ago. EPS were $2.20, down $0.90 year-over-year.
Looking forward
The company expects many of the same factors that impacted third quarter results to impact its fourth quarter results. The company expects revenue to decline in the high-single to low-double digit range year-over-year and EPS to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 compared to EPS of $1.18 in the fourth quarter of 2004.

The company will be hosting a conference call with securities analysts today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 31, 2005, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the accelerated vesting of certain unvested out-of-the-money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $80.00 per share. These options, which were previously awarded to its employees under the Companys equity compensation plans, would have otherwise vested in the years 2006 through 2008. The acceleration of vesting was effective for approximately
2.4
million unvested options, or
39
% of the Companys total outstanding unvested options. Options held by nonemployee directors and executive officers were not included in the vesting acceleration.
The acceleration of these options eliminates future compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its income statement with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment
(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is being adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2006. As a result of the acceleration, the Company expects to reduce its pre-tax stock option compensation expense by approximately $25 million over the course of the original vesting periods.
This report contains forward-looking statements, including those relating to the estimated reduction in compensation expense required to be recognized under SFAS 123R and the accounting treatment for the acceleration. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements including, without limitation, the possibility that subsequent pronouncements or interpretations of SFAS 123R may alter the accounting treatment of stock options, as well as other risks described in the Companys most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are based on managements estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.
Item 8.01.
 
Other Events.
On January 1, 2006, Frank T. Cary, a member of the Companys Board of Directors since March 1991, passed away. He has always been a strong contributor to the Companys Board as well as a source of guidance and expertise. He will be greatly missed.

Item 2.05.
 
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
As part of the companys ongoing optimization of its cost and expense structure, the company continually reviews its resources in light of a variety of factors. On January 24, 2006, the company determined that it would restructure its workforce, consolidate some manufacturing capacity, including the closure of one of its European facilities, and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans that are expected to save approximately $80 million per year in the aggregate. The workforce restructuring is expected to eliminate or transfer approximately 1,350 positions, with about 825 positions being eliminated, and approximately 525 positions being transferred from various locations primarily to low cost countries. The company plans to consolidate its manufacturing capacity to reduce manufacturing costs, including the closure of its Rosyth, Scotland inkjet cartridge manufacturing facility, and expects to reduce its operating expenses, particularly in the areas of supply chain, G&A and marketing and sales. The company also plans to freeze benefit accruals in its defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees, to be effective April 2006, and at the same time change from a maximum company matching contribution of three percent to an automatic company contribution of one percent and a maximum company matching contribution of five percent to the companys existing 401(k) plan. The company plans to make a maximum company matching contribution of six percent to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan on compensation amounts in excess of IRS qualified plan limits. The company expects that all of these changes in its operations will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $130 million, of which $80 million is cash. The pre-tax charges in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be approximately $50 million. The text of the press release announcing the workforce reduction and retirement plan changes is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01.
 
Other Events.
On January 20, 2006, the company received authorization from its Board of Directors to repurchase an additional $1 billion of its Class A Common Stock. This repurchase authorization raises the aggregate repurchase authorization to $3.9 billion from the $2.9 billion previously granted by the Board. The company has used approximately $2.57 billion of the prior authorization to repurchase approximately 55 million shares. The text of the press release announcing the additional repurchase authorization is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Lexmark announces fourth quarter and full year results
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
Jan 24
, 2006
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.37 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year, a decline of 12 percent. Earnings per share were $0.71 compared to $1.18 last year.
In the fourth quarter, year-over-year business segment revenue of $693 million was down 12 percent, and consumer segment revenue of $672 million was down 11 percent. Revenue in both segments was lower principally due to hardware price declines, lower hardware unit sales, and weak supplies sales.
Gross profit margin declined to 28.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 32.0 percent in the same period last year, mostly driven by lower product gross margins. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 20.0 percent versus 19.2 percent last year due to the decline in revenue outpacing the reduction in operating expenses.
Fourth-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $213 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million, and Lexmark repurchased $200 million of its stock during the quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was $331 million at quarter end. On January 20, 2006, the companys board of directors increased its share repurchase authorization by $1.0 billion, resulting in a total repurchase authorization of $1.3 billion.
The company also announced a restructuring plan today to improve its cost and expense structure. The restructuring actions will eliminate or transfer approximately 1,350 positions, with about 825 positions being eliminated, and approximately 525 positions being transferred from various locations worldwide primarily to low cost countries. This plan includes:
"Although our fourth quarter EPS results were better than expected, they were significantly below a year ago, reflecting a continuation of very challenging business conditions. While we are taking steps to improve our cost and expense structure, at the same time we are committed to maintaining our strategic investments in new product development and branding to strengthen our positioning in growth market segments in which we are currently underrepresented," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
New All-in-Ones strengthen companys SOHO position
As a result of the companys continued strategic focus on increasing its penetration in growth segments, Lexmark strengthened its position in the small office/home office market with the recent announcement of two new all-in-ones, the Lexmark X7350 and Lexmark X8350.
The Lexmark X7350 Office All-in-One printer announced earlier this month, affordably priced at under $150, demonstrates business-class performance as it leads this class of products with up to 25 pages per minute (ppm) black and 19 ppm color, and a 50 page automatic document feeder (ADF). Priced at under $200, the Lexmark X8350 Office All-in-One Plus Photo announced in November also offers full photo capabilities with its 2.4-inch color LCD, PictBridge, and photo card slots. Both the X7350 and X8350 are network capable, with optional Ethernet and wireless adapters.
Full Year 2005 Financial Results
Revenue for the full year ending December 31, 2005, was $5.22 billion, down 2 percent compared to the same period last year. Gross profit margin was 31.3 percent, compared to 33.7 percent a year ago. EPS were $2.91, down $1.37 year-over-year. EPS would have been $3.33 without the second quarter tax cost of $0.42 per share resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Looking forward
In the first quarter, the company expects revenue to decline in the high-single digit to low-double digit range year over year. It expects first quarter 2006 EPS to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70, excluding restructuring charges of approximately $0.33 per share, excluding a one-time curtailment gain of $0.06 per share, and including FAS123R options expenses of $0.06 per share. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.43. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2005 were $0.96.

The company will be hosting a conference call with securities analysts today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 22, 2006, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) certified the attainment level of the performance criteria for the 2005 incentive compensation awards granted pursuant to the Companys Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Incentive Compensation Plan). The Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by stockholders on April 22, 2004 and is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. In February 2005, awards were made to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), other than Mr. Gamble, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2005. The annual incentive compensation awards were determined based on the Companys performance during 2005 as measured against the performance measure established in February 2005. The Companys performance measure for 2005 was operating income, however, the Incentive Compensation Plan provides that the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the award to any of the Named Executive Officers based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, revenue, operating income, cash cycle days, divisional revenue, divisional operating income, divisional cash cycle days, and individual performance. The cash payments made to the Named Executive Officers with respect to their annual incentive compensation awards for 2005 were as follows: Dr. Curlander, $160,000, Mr. Rooke, $71,085, Mr. Morin, $62,514, and Mr. Bahous, $64,256.
On February 22, 2006, the Compensation Committee also granted annual incentive compensation awards with respect to 2006 to the Companys Named Executive Officers pursuant to the Incentive Compensation Plan. The maximum award which may be earned under the Incentive Compensation Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of operating income for the one-year performance period, however, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the award based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, revenue, operating income, cash cycle days, divisional revenue, divisional operating income, divisional cash cycle days, and individual performance.
On February 22, 2006, the Compensation Committee certified the attainment levels of the performance criteria for the 2003-2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2003-2005 LTIP) awards to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers with respect to the three year period ending December 31, 2005. The 2003-2005 LTIP was approved by the Compensation Committee on February 11, 2003 and the form of the agreement for each of the Named Executive Officers was filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The 2003-2005 LTIP awards were determined based on the Companys performance during 2003-2005 as measured against performance measures established in February 2003. The performance measures for the 2003-2005 LTIP included revenue, operating income, and cash cycle days for all participants. The cash payments made to each of the Named Executive Officers with respect to their 2003-2005 LTIP awards were as follows: Dr. Curlander, $2,088,609, Mr. Rooke, $857,822, Mr. Morin, $775,769, and Mr. Bahous, $522,152.
In addition to the above items, on February 22, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved grants of ten-year non-qualified stock options to each of the Named Executive Officers pursuant to the Companys Stock Incentive Plan. The Companys Stock Incentive Plan was approved by stockholders on April 30, 2003 and filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The options were granted at an exercise price of $48.05 (the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on the date of grant) and will vest in three approximately equal annual installments (34%, 33%, 33%) beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment. In addition, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of 50,000 restricted stock units to Dr. Curlander pursuant to the Companys Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock units will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33%, 33%) no earlier than February 22, 2008, February 22, 2009 and February 22, 2010, respectively, subject to Dr. Curlanders continued employment and certain performance criteria being met for each individual tranche. If the established performance criteria are not met by February 22, 2013, any unvested portion of the grant remaining will expire on that date. Each of Messrs. Rooke and Bahous also received grants of 15,000 restricted stock units that will vest and settle in five equal annual installments (20% per year), beginning on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment. The following table sets forth information regarding the individual grants of stock options and restricted stock units to each of the Named Executive Officers:
On February 23, 2006, the Board of Directors determined that there should be no change in the annual base salary levels of the Companys Named Executive Officers.
In addition, on February 23, 2006, upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of the Board, the Board approved the terms of the compensation to be paid to each eligible nonemployee director of the Board in respect of his/her service to the Board. A summary describing the elements of such compensation is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference. Other than with respect to the Initial Award granted to an individual upon joining the Board changing from an award of stock options with a face value of $600,000
to an award of restricted stock units with a face value of $150,000, the compensation for directors for 2006 will remain the same as in 2005.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2005 in the proxy statement for the Companys 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2006.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 13, 2006, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) granted Long-Term Incentive Awards pursuant to the 2006-2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2006-2008 LTIP) under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan. The 2006-2008 LTIP is intended to reward the achievement of specific long-term objectives. Under this program, certain executives, including four of the Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)), are eligible for an award denominated in cash, but payable in cash, Class A Common Stock of the Company or a combination of the two, at the end of the three-year period based on the achievement of two objectives. The Compensation Committee has established operating income and market share as the performance measures for the 2006 through 2008 period. If the aggregate attainment based upon the two performance measures is below the Minimum level (30% of Target), the 2006-2008 LTIP will be funded at the Minimum level if the Companys return on invested capital is at or above the median average of the return on invested capital of the peer companies included in the S&P Technology Index (or, if such index is no longer available, another appropriate index as determined by the Compensation Committee). The Compensation Committee also may use negative discretion in determining any payment to participants under the 2006-2008 LTIP. The Minimum, Target and Maximum award amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers receiving an award is set forth in the following table.
The foregoing summary of the Companys 2006-2008 LTIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006-2008 LTIP Agreement and the Companys Stock Incentive Plan, pursuant to which the 2006-2008 LTIP awards were made.

Our investments in product development are evident in new products that are winning awards and strengthening our position in key growth segments," said Paul J.

Operating expense as a percent of revenue excluding restructuring related charges and pension curtailment benefit would have been 20.6 percent in the first quarter as year-to-year improvements in marketing expenses outpaced increased investments in research and development. The operating expense to revenue ratio was 21.0 percent in the first quarter of 2005. Operating income margin excluding restructuring related charges and pension curtailment benefit would have been 12.6 percent in the first quarter. Operating income margin was 11.9 percent in same quarter last year.

Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2006. Second-quarter revenue was $1.23 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year, a decline of 4 percent. Second-quarter earnings per share were $0.74 and include FAS123(R) expense of $0.06 per share. Earnings per share would have been $1.07 excluding $0.35 per share restructuring related charges for actions announced in January, and excluding a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. Second-quarter 2005 earnings were $0.64, or $1.06 excluding the tax cost of $0.42 per share resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Earnings for the second quarter were significantly better than expected. While we have more work to do, we are making progress on our product, market and restructuring initiatives. Recent introductions of new color laser, monochrome laser and inkjet products strengthen our position in the key growth segments. In addition, we are generating solid cash flow while continuing to invest in R&D and initiatives to drive our long-term success, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Curlander.
Second-quarter business segment revenue of $713 million increased 1 percent year to year, and consumer segment revenue of $516 million declined 10 percent compared to a year ago. Second-quarter results include restructuring related pretax charges totaling $53 million including $16 million in cost of revenue, and $37 million in operating expense. Including these charges, gross profit margin was 34.0 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 25.6 percent and operating income margin was 8.4 percent.
Excluding restructuring related charges, gross profit margin would have been 35.3 percent in the second quarter, up from 34.6 percent in the same period last year. Operating expense as a percent of revenue excluding restructuring related charges would have been 22.6 percent in the second quarter, higher than 20.9 percent in the second quarter of 2005 due to the year-to-year revenue decline and increased FAS123(R) expense. Operating income margin excluding restructuring related charges would have been 12.8 percent in the second quarter. Operating income margin was 13.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
Second-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $142 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million. Lexmark repurchased $300 million of its
 
stock during the quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was about $730 million at quarter end.
New products, industry recognition demonstrate progress on strategic initiatives
Lexmark continues to make progress on its strategic initiatives.

Revenue for the first six months of 2006 was $2.50 billion, a decrease of 5 percent versus the same period in 2005. In the first half of 2006, gross profit margin was 32.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.9 percent, operating income margin was 8.9 percent, and EPS were $1.52. 2006 first-half results include restructuring related charges totaling $103 million, including $35 million in cost of revenue, and $68 million in operating expense. First-half operating expense also includes a $10 million pension curtailment benefit. First-half EPS includes a $2.5 million tax benefit from the second-quarter resolution of income tax matters.
Excluding restructuring and related charges, pension curtailment benefit, and the tax benefit, gross profit margin would have been 34.2 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio would have been 21.5 percent, operating income margin would have been 12.7 percent, and EPS would have been $2.10. In the first half of 2005, gross profit margin was 33.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 21.0 percent, and operating income margin was 12.8 percent.

In the first six months of 2006, the company generated $361 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested $93 million in capital expenditures, and repurchased $600 million of company stock.
Looking forward
In the third quarter, the company expects revenue to be flat to down in the low-single digit range year over year. It expects third-quarter 2006 EPS to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.59. This includes restructuring related charges of approximately $0.16 per share. EPS excluding restructuring related charges in the third quarter of 2006 are expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.75. EPS in the third quarter of 2005 were $0.59.

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On December 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company), upon recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee, approved an amendment to Article II, Section 2.03 of the Companys By-Laws to adopt a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections. The new majority vote standard provides that to be elected, in an uncontested election, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast such that the number of shares voted for the nominee must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee or in the Boards decision. If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board.
The amendment to the By-Laws became effective on December 20, 2006 and is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Section 1.
 
Amendment to ARTICLE II of By-Laws
. ARTICLE II of the By-Laws is hereby amended by inserting as the second paragraph of Section 2.03.
Election of Directors
the following:
Except as provided in Section 2.12 of this Article, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. If a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee or in the Boards decision.

 Exhibit 99.1
   
  
Lexmark board of directors adopts majority vote standard for election of directors
LEXINGTON, Ky.,
Dec. 20, 2006
-- Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced that its board of directors has amended the companys by-laws to adopt a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections.
The adoption of the majority vote standard requires each director to receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director. Previously, directors were elected under a plurality vote standard, which meant that the candidates receiving the most votes would be elected without regard to whether those votes constituted a majority of the shares voting at the meeting. Contested elections (in which there are more nominees than directors to be elected) will continue to use the plurality standard.
Under the laws of Delaware, where Lexmark is incorporated, if an incumbent director is not elected, that director continues to serve as a holdover director until the directors successor is duly elected and qualified. To address this potential outcome, the board has also adopted a director resignation policy in the companys by-laws. If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast, the director shall offer his or her resignation to the board. The Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee would then make a recommendation to the board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board would then publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days of the certification of the election results.
The new majority vote standard is effective immediately and will be implemented at Lexmarks upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 26, 2007.

Lexmark reports fourth quarter results
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
 
Jan. 30, 2007
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.369 billion, about flat compared to revenue of $1.365 billion last year. Fourth-quarter earnings per share were $0.91 and include $0.06 per share for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 15.9 percent, primarily reflecting the retroactive extension of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit. Earnings per share would have been $1.05, excluding $0.14 per share restructuring-related charges for actions announced in January 2006. Fourth-quarter 2005 earnings per share were $0.71.
Overall, this was a good quarter for Lexmark and we believe we are on course with our strategy. We saw strong branded unit growth in the quarter in our targeted growth segments of low-end monochrome lasers, color lasers, laser all-in-ones, and inkjet all-in-ones. Our ongoing investments in product and brand development are better positioning us in these targeted segments, which are the engine for long-term growth, said Lexmark Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Curlander.
Fourth-quarter business segment revenue of $772 million grew 11 percent year to year, and consumer segment revenue of $597 million declined 11 percent compared to a year ago. Fourth-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was 30.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.3 percent, and operating income margin was 7.5 percent. These results include restructuring-related pretax charges totaling $19 million, comprised of $3 million in cost of revenue and $16 million in operating expense. Excluding restructuring-related charges:
Fourth-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $143 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $58 million. Lexmark repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its stock during the quarter for $141 million. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was about $460 million at quarter end.
Recent wins showcase strength of Lexmarks value proposition
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), The Childrens Hospital at Westmead, and Health First are among customers who have recently chosen Lexmark to help them print smarter, move information faster and more effectively, and better manage their printing environment.
Accolades for Lexmarks products continue
Lexmark is continuing to garner industry recognition for its innovative new products, the introduction of which has been supported by its increased level of investment in research and development. Lexmarks 2006 success in winning awards for its products is being featured in updated television advertising. The advertising highlights the fact that, last year, the top U.S. independent test labs awarded Lexmark more laser printer awards in its class than any other leading printer brand.
Among the recognition received during the fourth quarter, Lexmark received Fall Pick of the Year awards from Buyers Laboratory, Inc., for laser hardware and software solutions, including:
Lexmark also earned recognition for Best Hardware Solution across its line of products at CMP Medias 2006 XChange Tech Innovator Conference.
Also during the quarter, PC Magazine named the new Lexmark C534dn color laser printer as an Editors Choice.
In addition, Lexmarks new X5470 inkjet four-in-one was named as an International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Innovations 2007 Design and Engineering Awards honoree in the Mobile/Home Office Category.
Full-year results
2006 revenue was $5.108 billion, down 2 percent compared to revenue of $5.222 billion in 2005. 2006 business segment revenue grew 3 percent, and consumer segment revenue declined 8 percent.
2006 operating income of $443 million includes $41 million for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. Operating income would have been $568 million, excluding $135 million for restructuring-related charges and $10 million pension curtailment benefit for actions announced in January 2006. 2005 operating income was $534 million, or $544 million excluding 2005 workforce reduction charges.
2006 earnings per share were $3.27 and include $0.24 per share for share-based compensation expenses resulting from the companys adoption of SFAS 123R. Excluding $0.85 per share restructuring-related charges and pension curtailment benefit for actions announced in January 2006, earnings per share would have been $4.12. 2005 earnings per share were $2.91. 2005 EPS would have been $3.37 excluding $0.06 per share workforce reduction charges and the net tax cost of $0.40 per share primarily resulting from the approval to repatriate $684 million during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.
2006 net cash provided by operating activities was $671 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $202 million. Lexmark repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of its stock during the year for $871 million.
Looking forward
In the first quarter of 2007, the company expects revenue to decline in the low- to mid-single digit percentage range year over year. It expects first-quarter 2007 EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. This includes restructuring-related charges of approximately $0.03 per share. EPS excluding restructuring-related charges in the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.93 to $1.03. EPS in the first quarter of 2006 were $0.78, or $1.03 excluding $0.31 per share restructuring-related charges and $0.06 per share pension curtailment benefit.

Under this program, certain executives, including the Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), are eligible for an award denominated in cash, but payable in cash, Class A Common Stock of the Company, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has established 2009 operating income and branded hardware market share as the performance measures for the 2007 through 2009 performance cycle. If the attainment of operating income and branded hardware market share results in no funding, the 2007-2009 LTIP will be funded at the Minimum level if the Companys three-year average return on invested capital is at or above the median of the three-year average of the return on invested capital of the peer companies included in the S&P Technology Index (or, if such index is no longer available, another appropriate index as determined by the Compensation Committee). The Compensation Committee also has negative discretion in determining any payment to participants under the 2007-2009 LTIP. The Minimum, Target, and Maximum award amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers is set forth in the following table. The form of the 2007-2009 LTIP Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference.

This 2007-2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2007-2009 LTIP") Agreement (Agreement) by and between Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the person specified on the signature page (the "Participant") is entered into as of February 21, 2007.
This Agreement is only a summary of the principal terms governing the 2007-2009 LTIP. The 2007-2009 LTIP is subject in all respects to the terms of the Lexmark International, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated April 30, 2003 (the "Plan"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. It is important that the Participant read and understand the Plan and not rely solely on the brief description that follows. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Overview
The 2007-2009 LTIP is designed to reward the achievement of specific performance objectives over a three-year period. The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") established the performance objectives and performance measures set forth below for the performance period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending December 31, 2009 (the "Performance Period").
Depending upon the Company's attainment of the performance objectives and certain financial performance measures of the Company's peers, the Participant may be eligible to receive a payment under the 2007-2009 LTIP, as set forth below.
Plan Measurements
For the Performance Period, the Committee has established the following performance measures based on the Company's strategic plan for the Performance Period:
Branded Hardware Market Share attainment will be calculated by aggregating the points achieved in each hardware market segment as outlined in the following tables. The market share of each hardware market segment will be measured at the end of the Performance Period based on market research data reported by IDC or such other market research provider as determined to be appropriate by the Committee at such time, in its sole discretion.
At the end of the three-year Performance Period, if the attainment of Operating Income and Branded Hardware Market Share results in no funding for the 2007-2009 LTIP, there is an additional calculation comparing the three-year average Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") for the Company with that of its peer companies over the same three-year period (2007 through 2009). The calculation of the Company's three-year average ROIC will be based upon the average of Net Income before Extraordinary Items for fiscal years 2007 through 2009. If the Company's three-year average ROIC is at or above the median of the three-year average of the ROIC of the peer companies included in the S&P Technology Index or, in the event that such index is no longer available, such other index as determined to be appropriate by the Committee at the time in its sole discretion, the 2007-2009 LTIP will be funded at 15% of Target for each of the two performance measures (30% of Target, as specified below) regardless of any below-Minimum attainment for the two performance measures.
Target Opportunity
The 2007-2009 LTIP awards are denominated in cash, but in the Committee's sole discretion may be paid in cash, the Companys Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and the Companys Class A Common Stock. For the Performance Period, your target award is _____________.
The chart below and the examples in Attachment A illustrate how the 2007-2009 LTIP awards will be calculated. The level of attainment for Operating Income is not linked to the level of attainment for Branded Hardware Market Share. As a result, the level of attainment on each performance measure may independently generate a payment to Participants based on its achievement.
Committee Discretion
The Committee may use its sole discretion in determining any payment, or no payment, to Participants under the 2007-2009 LTIP based on any factors that it deems appropriate.
Payout Timing
The Committee intends to review and approve the Company's business results and Branded Hardware Market Share position as compared to the 2007-2009 LTIP performance measures and, if applicable, the Company's ROIC compared to the peer companies included in the index stated above following the end of the three-year Performance Period. These reviews are expected to occur in a 2010 Committee meeting. Payments will be made in 2010. Payments will be made only after the Committee approval has occurred.
Termination of Employment
Except in the event of the death, long-term disability or retirement of the Participant, the Participant must be employed at the end of the Performance Period (December 31, 2009) to receive a payout. If the Participant should die, become long-term disabled or retire during the Performance Period, the payout, if any is achieved based on actual performance of the Company and its peers over the Performance Period, will be prorated and paid out after the end of the Performance Period.
Forfeiture of the Award
The Participant acknowledges that this opportunity for a long-term incentive award has been granted as an incentive to the Participant to remain employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to exert his or her best efforts to enhance the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries over the long-term. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that if he or she (a) within 12 months of termination of employment with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, accepts employment with a competitor of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise engages in competition with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (b) within 36 months of termination of employment with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, disrupts, damages, interferes or otherwise acts against the interests of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, recruiting, soliciting or employing, or encouraging or assisting the Participant's new employer or any other person or entity to recruit, solicit or employ, any employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries without the Company's prior written consent, which may withheld in its sole discretion, or (c) within 36 months of termination of employment with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, disparages, criticizes, or otherwise makes any derogatory statements regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their directors, officers or employees, or (d) discloses or otherwise uses confidential information or material of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, each of these constituting a harmful action, then the Participant shall immediately repay to the Company the full amount of the award received under the terms and conditions of the 2007-2009 LTIP. The Committee shall have the right not to enforce the provisions of this paragraph with respect to the Participant.
Participant agrees to be fully liable for any remedies available at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, for any breach of this above described covenant, promise and agreement. Participant agrees to reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing the obligations of Participant. This entire provision shall survive the termination of the Agreement and, in no manner, shall the remedies described herein be considered as the Companys exclusive or entire remedy for Participants breach, non-compliance or violation of this Agreement or any other agreement that Participant may have entered into with the Company.
Tax Withholding
In the event that the payout of the award is made in Class A Common Stock of the Company, delivery of such stock shall not be made unless and until the Participant, or, if applicable, the Participants beneficiary or estate, has made appropriate arrangements for the payment to the Company of an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding or other tax requirements, as determined by the Company. To satisfy the Participants applicable withholding and other tax requirements, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold a number of shares of Class A Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the payout date equal to the applicable amount of such withholding and other tax requirements, subject to any rules adopted by the Committee or required to ensure compliance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Any cash payment made under this Agreement shall be made net of any amounts required to be withheld or paid with respect thereto (and with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock delivered therewith) under any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding and other tax requirements.
Transferability
Unless otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the award granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by the Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The term Participant as used in this Agreement shall include any permitted transferee.
Interpretation; Construction
All powers and authority conferred upon the Committee pursuant to any term of the Plan or this Agreement shall be exercised by the Committee, in its sole discretion. All determinations, interpretations or other actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan or this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons and, in the event of any judicial review thereof, shall be overturned only if arbitrary and capricious. The Committee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel.
Amendment
The Committee shall have the right to alter or amend the 2007-2009 LTIP and this Agreement in its sole discretion, from time to time, as provided in the Plan in any manner for the purpose of promoting the objectives of the Plan, provided that no such amendment shall impair the Participant's rights under the 2007-2009 LTIP without the Participant's consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, any alteration or amendment to the 2007-2009 LTIP by the Committee shall, upon adoption by the Committee, become and be binding and conclusive. The Company shall give written notice to the Participant of any such alteration or amendment of the 2007-2009 LTIP as promptly as practical after the adoption. This Agreement may also be amended in writing signed by both an authorized representative of the Company and the Participant.
No Guarantee of Employment or Future Incentive Awards

(a) interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the Participant's employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause;
(b) confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary; and
(c) provide Participant the right to receive any Incentive Awards under the Plan in the future or any other benefits the Company may provide to some or all of its employees.

Assignability
Neither this Agreement or any right, remedy, obligation or liability arising hereunder or by reason hereof shall be assignable by the Company or the Participant without the prior consent of the other party.
Applicable Law
The 2007-2009 LTIP and this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the law that might be applied under principles of conflict of laws and excluding any conflict or choice of law rule or principle that may otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the 2007-2009 LTIP or this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.

The Participant hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Kentucky located in Fayette County, Kentucky, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Kentucky state or United States federal courts located in such jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

Lexmark reports first quarter results
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
 
April 24, 2007
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2007. First-quarter revenue was $1.261 billion, down 1 percent compared to revenue of $1.275 billion last year. First-quarter earnings per share were $0.95. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 would have been $0.96 excluding $0.01 per share restructuring-related charges. First-quarter 2006 earnings per share were $0.78. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2006 excluding $0.31 per share restructuring-related charges and $0.06 per share pension curtailment gain would have been $1.03.
While our results were in line with the guidance ranges we provided on our January call, we view this as a mixed quarter for Lexmark. Among the factors affecting our results were some strong positives, some challenges, and some investments we believe are necessary to continue to strengthen our competitive position and to position us for long-term growth," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
"On the positive side, highlights for the quarter included strong branded unit growth in the key focus segments of color laser, laser all-in-ones, and inkjet all-in-ones. Total branded hardware revenue was up year to year for the fourth straight quarter. We saw good revenue growth in our business market segment in both core hardware and supplies revenue. Branded inkjet units were up year to year, starting to recover after unit declines in 2006. Challenges included OEM unit sales that continued to be weak, declines in inkjet supplies sales, and hardware pricing that was fairly aggressive in both laser and inkjet markets," Curlander said.
"During the quarter we continued to step up our investments in brand development and R&D. Given the strength of our product line, we are now increasing our investment in demand generation in all customer segments. While these investments negatively impact results in the current quarter, we believe we will see the benefit from these investments in the future," said Curlander.
First-quarter 2007 business segment revenue of $737 million grew 7 percent year to year and consumer segment revenue of $523 million declined 11 percent compared to a year ago. First-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 33.5 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.9 percent, and operating income margin was 9.6 percent. First-quarter 2007 results include $2 million net restructuring-related pretax charges. This $2 million net impact is comprised of $1 million in cost of revenue and $1 million in operating expense.
First-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was 31.7 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 22.2 percent, and operating income margin was 9.5 percent. First-quarter 2006 results include $50 million restructuring-related pretax charges and $10 million pretax pension curtailment benefit resulting in a net impact of $19 million in cost of revenue and $21 million in operating expense.
Excluding first-quarter restructuring-related charges and the first-quarter 2006 pension curtailment benefit:
First-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $87 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $49 million. Lexmark repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of its stock during the quarter for $165 million. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was about $295 million at quarter end. The company ended the quarter with $443 million in cash and marketable securities.
New products capitalize on important industry dynamics
Today, the company introduced an entire new line of products focused on the rapidly growing color laser segment. The companys new color laser MFP line includes the X782e and the X940e family for business workgroups, and the X500n family for desktop users and smaller workgroups. The Lexmark C780n and the C935dn printer families are designed for business workgroups that need access to high-quality, reliable color printing technology at affordable prices. These new color lasers significantly increase Lexmarks offerings in this important growth segment.
Lexmark continues to receive important industry recognition for its color laser products.
Last week, the company announced that, with the introduction of its 2007 inkjet product line, Lexmark will offer the broadest, most affordable range of wireless printers in the market. The company believes that consumers are embracing wireless networking with the rapid adoption of wireless laptop computers and wireless routers. Demonstrating its commitment to leadership in wireless printing, eight out of Lexmarks 12 new inkjet printers being introduced in 2007 will have wireless capabilities spanning four-in-one, three-in-one and single-function printer categories. Once Lexmarks full 2007 line is available, it will include six inkjet printers with integrated wireless and two with optional wireless capability. Available in the second quarter are the Lexmark X4550 Wireless All-in-One, the Lexmark Z1420 Wireless Color Printer, and the Lexmark X3550 Color All-in-One with wireless as an optional feature. The remaining wireless offerings will be introduced and available later this year.
New solutions leverage Lexmarks deep and proven industry expertise
The Lexmark Education Station announced today helps schools meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act and builds on the companys heritage of providing unique workflow solutions for education. Likewise, the Lexmark Clinical Assistant announced earlier in the quarter delivers Lexmarks proven solutions for the health care industry in a unique way to help nursing and clinical staff with medical records management, physician order routing, card copying, and forms on demand. Both solutions utilize the companys award-winning Lexmark X646dte monochrome laser MFP platform with unique capabilities easily accessed via the companys intuitive eTask touchscreen interface.
Looking forward
In the second quarter of 2007, the company expects revenue to be down in the low- to mid-single digit percentage range year over year. It expects second-quarter 2007 EPS to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92. EPS in the second quarter of 2006 were $0.74, or $1.09 excluding $0.35 per share restructuring-related charges.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Lexmark revises financial outlook
LEXINGTON, Ky., July 9, 2007  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced that financial results for its second quarter of 2007 will be lower than expected.
Although based on partial data for the quarter, the company expects its second-quarter revenue to decline about 2 percent year over year. It expects its GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.69. Excluding net restructuring-related benefits, the company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.67.  Both of these earnings per share ranges include an expected tax benefit of about $0.05 per share. This compares to the $0.82 to $0.92 earnings per share guidance it provided for the second quarter.
As compared to the companys guidance for the second quarter, the earnings per share impact is due to a shortfall in operating income in the consumer market segment. This shortfall is primarily due to less than expected inkjet supplies revenue, lower hardware average unit revenue driven by aggressive pricing and promotion, some greater than expected product costs, and greater than expected branded inkjet unit growth.
Looking ahead, the company expects these same factors to impact the third quarter. In the third quarter of 2007, although the analysis is not yet complete, the company currently expects earnings per share to be around $0.00 to $0.10.  The company plans to release second-quarter earnings on July 24, 2007.

Lexmark reports second quarter results
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
 
July 24, 2007
-
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2007. Second-quarter revenue was $1.208 billion, down 2 percent compared to revenue of $1.229 billion last year. Second-quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2007 would have been $0.65 excluding a net $0.02 per share benefit from restructuring-related activities. Second-quarter 2007 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share include a tax benefit of about $0.05 per share. Second-quarter 2006 GAAP earnings per share were $0.74. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 excluding $0.35 per share restructuring-related charges would have been $1.09.
Although we had a shortfall in our consumer market segment relative to the April 24 guidance, the business market segment performed about as expected. In addition, we had strong branded unit growth in our key focus segments of color laser, laser multifunction products and inkjet all-in-ones, and cash flow for the quarter was good as Lexmark continued to have a strong financial position and balance sheet, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. In the consumer segment, our focus going forward will be on improving product cost and price, and on products, customers and countries that drive pages.
"
Second-quarter 2007 business segment revenue of $734 million grew 3 percent year to year and consumer segment revenue of $474 million declined 8 percent compared to a year ago. Second-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 30.6 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 25.2 percent, the operating income margin was 5.4 percent, and net earnings were $64 million. In connection with the companys 2006 restructuring-related actions, second-quarter 2007 operating income includes $5 million pretax charges, and other income includes an $8 million foreign exchange pretax gain realized upon the substantial liquidation of the companys Scotland legal entity.
Second-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was 34.0 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 25.6 percent, the operating income margin was 8.4 percent, and net earnings were $77 million. Second-quarter 2006 results include $53 million restructuring-related pretax charges.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding second-quarter restructuring-related charges:
Second-quarter 2007 gross profit margin would have been 31.0 percent, down 4.3 percentage points from 35.3 percent in the same period last year, principally due to lower product margins.
l
    Second-quarter 2007 operating expense as a percentage of revenue would have been 25.2 percent, up 2.6 percentage points from 22.6 percent in the same
l
 
        quarter last year, driven by increased demand generation and product development investments.
     Second-quarter 2007 operating income margin would have been 5.9 percent, down 6.9 percentage points from 12.8 percent last year, primarily reflecting a significant decline in consumer segment operating income.
l
    Second-quarter 2007 net earnings would have been $62 million compared to $114 million in the second quarter of 2006.
l
Second-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $124 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million. Lexmark did not repurchase its stock during the second quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $295 million at quarter end. The company ended the quarter with $527 million in cash and marketable securities.
Looking Forward
In the third quarter of 2007, the company expects revenue to be down in the low- to mid-single digit percentage range year over year. It expects third-quarter 2007 GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.10 per share. EPS in the third quarter of 2006 were $0.85, or $0.95 excluding $0.10 per share restructuring-related charges.

Lexmark reports third quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 23, 2007 -- Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2007. Third-quarter revenue was $1.195 billion, down 3 percent compared to revenue of $1.235 billion last year. Third-quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.48. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2007 would have been $0.60 excluding $0.12 per share for restructuring-related activities.  In the third quarter of 2007, the GAAP provision for income taxes was a benefit of $18 million, reflecting tax benefits due to the finalization of certain tax audits in the quarter and a reduction in the expected full-year tax rate.  Third-quarter 2006 GAAP earnings per share were $0.85.  Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 would have been $0.95 excluding $0.10 per share for restructuring-related activities.
Third-quarter 2007 business segment revenue of $728 million grew 5 percent year to year and consumer segment revenue of $468 million declined 13 percent compared to a year ago. Third-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 27.8 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 26.1 percent, the operating income margin was 1.7 percent, and net earnings were $45 million. Third-quarter 2007 operating income includes $15 million pretax charges in connection with the companys restructuring-related actions.
Third-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was 32.6 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 23.3 percent, the operating income margin was 9.3 percent, and net earnings were $86 million. Third-quarter 2006 results include $13 million restructuring-related pretax charges.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding third-quarter restructuring-related charges:
The company ended the quarter with $639 million in cash and marketable securities. Third-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $142 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $39 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $50 million. Lexmark did not repurchase its stock during the third quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $295 million at quarter end.
Although our business market segment continues to meet our expectations and our third quarter earnings per share were better than expected, EPS were significantly below a year ago, reflecting the continuation of a very challenging situation in our consumer market segment.  We are taking steps to shift our consumer market segment focus to higher-usage customers and to improve our cost and expense structure.  At the same time, we are committed to continuing our strategic investments in new product development and branding to strengthen our position in growth market segments, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
The company announced a restructuring plan today which includes:
These actions are expected to impact approximately 1,650 positions by the end of 2008.  Most of the impacted positions are being moved to lower-cost countries.
The company estimates that these actions will result in pretax costs of approximately $20 million in 2007, and $70 million in 2008. Total savings from the restructuring are expected to be about $40 million in 2008, and to be approximately $60 million annually once these actions are completed.
Legal Partner and Wireless Inkjets Capitalize on Important Industry Dynamics
During the quarter, Lexmark introduced the Lexmark Legal Partner, a laser multifunction product that is customized specifically for the legal industry.  This product, along with the previously announced Education Station and Clinical Assistant, allows Lexmark to capitalize on its extensive research to identify unique document workflow management requirements and trends associated with specific industry verticals in the small and medium business space.
Additions to the new wireless line of inkjet products announced in the third quarter include three full-featured all-in-one printers delivering industry-leading value for small

--
Today we're announcing fourth-
quarter financial results that reflect the strategic shift we began in the second half of 2007. Although EPS greatly
exceeded expectations in the fourth
quarter, we have more work to do as we continue to implement our strategy to drive our growth in higher usage segments
,
said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
Our investments in industry-leading products and technology are an integral part of our strategy and
are
demonstrated by the recent introduction of our new Professional Series inkjet line, our new high-performance color laser multifunction device, the X560n, and the significant product awards and industry recognition tha
t we received in 2007.  Overall
our financial position remains strong, and in 2007 we continued to generate strong cash flow from the on-going sale
s of our aftermarket supplies.
Fourth-quarter 2007 business segment revenue was a record $800 million growing 4 percent year to year. Consumer segment revenue of $509 million declined 15 percent compared to a year ago. Fourth-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 33.4 percent, the operating expense to revenue ratio was 24.7 percent, the operating income margin was 8.7 percent, and net earnings were $99 million.

New Products Expand Lexmarks Focus on High-Usage Customers
As part of Lexmarks strategy to increase the companys focus on higher-usage segments of the inkjet market, in early January Lexmark introduced the Professional Series which the company believes will meet the demanding needs of small office and home office (SOHO) users. The Professional Series is Lexmarks first inkjet all-in-one (AIO) line to include high-yield cartridges and lifetime, priority phone support. The Professional Series inkjet line features four inkjet AIOs including: the Lexmark X9575 Wireless All-in-One for $249; the Lexmark X6575 Wireless All-in-One priced at $169; the Lexmark X4875 Wireless All-in-One priced at $149; and the Lexmark X5075 All-in-One for $99.

Also in January, the company added to its award-winning line of color laser multifunction products (MFPs) with the announcement of the Lexmark X560n color laser MFP which is ideally suited for medium and large workgroups.

Separately, CRN, a channel publication for solution providers and valued-added resellers, named Lexmark the No. 1 Top Growth Best-Seller for MFPs for mid-year 2007. Lexmark was also listed on CRNs mid-year Top Five Best-Sellers List for both MFPs and color lasers.
Also in the quarter, Lexmarks C935 series was recognized by Better Buys for Business as one of the Innovative Products of the Year for 2007, an award reserved for products
 
that introduce an exciting new technology. In addition, Buyers Laboratory Inc. (BLI) awarded Lexmark four Fall 2007 Pick of the Year awards. The awards included: Outstanding Mid-Size Workgroup Color Printer, Outstanding Large Workgroup Color Printer, Outstanding Large Workgroup Color MFP, and Outstanding Mid-Size Workgroup Monochrome MFP for the Lexmark C782dtn, C935hdn, X945e, and X644e, respectively.

On February 14, 2008, the Company reported that on January 30, 2008 a fire occurred in one of the Company's sub-contracted distribution centers.  While we are still assessing what can be recovered, we believe we suffered a loss of inventory on inkjet products in the range of $18M to $25M, substantially all of which is inkjet hardware.  We believe that except for a $1M deductible, this loss will be covered by insurance.  Although there could be some impact to our revenue in the quarter as we work to restock the inventory, we currently do not believe that there will be a material adverse impact to earnings in the quarter due to this disruption.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
On March 24, 2008, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") granted long-term incentive award opportunities pursuant to the 2008-2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008-2010 LTIP" or the "Plan").  The 2008-2010 LTIP is intended to reward the achievement of specific financial objectives over a three-year performance period.  Under the 2008-2010 LTIP, certain executives, including five of the Company's Named Executive Officers (which officers were determined by reference to the Companys Proxy Statement dated March 24, 2008), are eligible to receive a cash award at the end of the three-year performance period based on the achievement of certain financial objectives.  The Compensation Committee has established Operating Income and Cash Cycle Days as the performance goals for the 2008 through 2010 performance period.  At the end of the three-year performance period, if there is no calculated payout based on the Operating Income and Cash Cycle Days attainment, an additional calculation comparing the Companys Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") with that of its peer companies over the same three-year period will be made.  If the Companys ROIC meets or exceeds the median of the three-year average return on invested capital of the Companys designated peer companies for 2010 which are included in the S&P Technology Index, then funding at the Minimum level will occur.
In the event of an executives death, disability or retirement ("disability" and "retirement," each as defined in the Plan) during the three-year performance period, a prorated portion of the actual attainment as of the end of the calendar year in which the death, disability or retirement occurs will be paid to the executive or his or her estate.  Except in the event of death, disability or retirement, the executive must be employed at the end of the three-year performance period to receive a payout, if any, under the Plan.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining any payout to an executive under the 2008-2010 LTIP applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The Minimum, Target and Maximum award opportunities for each of the Named Executive Officers receiving an award are set forth in the following table:

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 19, 2008, Lexmark International, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the offering and sale by the Company of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.900% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "notes due 2013") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.650% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "notes due 2018" and, together with the notes due 2013, the "Notes"). The offering of the Notes is expected to close on May 22, 2008.
The Notes will be issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, between the Company and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
The notes due 2013 will bear interest at a rate of 5.900% per year and the notes due 2018 will bear interest at a rate of 6.650% per year. Interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2008.

The Notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness.

liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (1) the information in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement regarding the delivery of the Securities; (2) the marketing names of the underwriters on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement; (3) the information in the third paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement concerning the offering price and selling terms; and (4) the information in the seventh paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement concerning stabilization and other transactions.
Indemnification of the Company
     (c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood

and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The
Contribution
 
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
     (f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
     8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
     9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
     10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
 
     (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     11. .
Payment of Expenses
 
     (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors; and (x) all expenses and application fees related to the listing of the Securities on the Exchange, if any.
     (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
     12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
     13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

Annex A-1
     (-) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of this Agreement; each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein; and, to our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or, to the best knowledge of such counsel, threatened by the Commission.
     (-) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, and (c) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date, in each case as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act; and the Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
     (-) Each Transaction Document conforms in all material respects to the summary descriptions thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     (-) The descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus of statutes, legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects; the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus under the heading "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations", and incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus from Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the extent that they constitute summaries of matters of law or regulation or legal conclusions, fairly summarize the matters described therein in all material respects;
     (-) To the best knowledge of such counsel, (A) there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to
 
be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that have not been so filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     (-) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
     (-) The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
     Such counsel shall also state that they have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, representatives of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed. We have not participated in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, however, we have reviewed such documents. Although such counsel assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which such counsel need express no belief).
 
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Thompson Hine LLP described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
 
Annex A-2

     (-) Each of the Company and LITSA has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     (-) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     (-) The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and, when they have been duly authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and enforceable in accordance with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, subject as to enforcement, to the Enforceability Exceptions.
     (-) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee pursuant
 
thereto constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.
     (-) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under each of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes, the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject, except for violations or defaults which individually or in the aggregate are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; nor will any such action result in any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of the Company or any subsidiary or any applicable law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties.
     (-) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental or regulatory authority is required for the issue and sale of the Notes or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, licenses, registrations or qualifications as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act or state securities or Blue Sky laws.

     Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at each such office or agency, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in the name of the designated transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series, in each case, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount.
     At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Security in global form) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount and Stated Maturity, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     A Holder may transfer a Security only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the proposed transferee and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture. No such transfer shall be effected until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of a Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer by the Registrar in the Security Register. Prior to the registration of any transfer by a Holder as provided herein, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company shall treat the Person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes whether or not the Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Furthermore, any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal Principal Amount of Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar
 
shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if the requirements for such transactions set forth herein are met. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request.
     The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities (other than any such transfer taxes or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 3.11, 9.05 or 11.03). No service charge to any Holder shall be made for any such transaction.
     The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities of any series selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security of any series where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     Section 3.08(a) Each Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary or such nominee and (iii) bear legends as set forth in Section 3.06.

     Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
Agent Members
     (b) Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary for such series, its successors or their respective nominees. If at any time the Depositary for the
 
Securities of such series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be qualified to serve as the Depositary, the Company shall appoint a successor depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series of like tenor, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Securities or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of a series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Securities. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series of like tenor and terms, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. In addition, Physical Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security, if (i) the Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, or (B) ceases to be qualified to serve as Depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable, registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, or (iii) an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual notice has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue such Physical Securities.
     (c) Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the another Global Security will, upon such transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
     (d) In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of
 
this Section 3.08, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the Principal Amount of such Global Security in an amount equal to the Principal Amount of the beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Physical Securities of like tenor and amount.
     (e) In connection with the transfer of an entire Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal Principal Amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations.
     (f) The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series.
     Section 3.09In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon the delivery to the Trustee of a Company Order and of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, a new Security of the same series bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each of them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security of the same series, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
 
such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless from all risks, however remote, and, in every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, with respect to the holder of a substitute Security, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     Section 3.10. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities.
     Section 3.11. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities of such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities of such series without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions
Temporary Securities.
 
and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, and upon delivery to the Trustee of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities a like aggregate Principal Amount of definitive Securities of such series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
     Section 3.12. The Company in issuing the Securities of any series may use a "CUSIP" or "ISIN" number (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders of such series; provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers.
CUSIP and ISIN Numbers.
     Section 4.01. The Company, for the benefit of each series of the Securities, will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest on Securities.
     Section 4.02. The Company will maintain a Payment Office where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices, and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
 
initially appoints the Trustee at its office or agency as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
     Section 4.03. (a) If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
     (b) Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     (c) The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities (other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent will agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.03, that such Paying Agent will (i) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent; (ii) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Holders until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (iii) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series; and (iv) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, and upon the written request of that Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
 
     (d) The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent will be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     (e) Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, or interest has become due and payable will be paid to the Company upon a Company Request (or, if then held by the Company, will be discharged from such trust); and the Holder of such Security will thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 calendar days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
     Section 4.04. Subject to Article 10, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and rights (charter and statutory); provided, however, that the Company will not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Existence.
     Section 4.05. The Company covenants and agrees that, so long as any of the Securities shall be outstanding, neither it nor any Subsidiary will incur any Lien on property or assets owned on or acquired after the date of this Indenture to secure Debt without making, or causing such Subsidiary to make, effective provision for securing the Securities (and, if the Company may so determine, any other Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary that is not subordinated in right or payment to the Securities) (x) equally and ratably with such Debt as to such property or assets for as long as such Debt will be so secured or (y) in the event such Debt is subordinated in right of payment to

     (c) any Lien on property of a Person existing immediately prior to the time such Person is merged with or into or consolidated with the Company or any Subsidiary or otherwise becomes a Subsidiary of the Company (provided that such Lien is not incurred in anticipation of such transaction and does not extend beyond the property subject thereto, or secure any Debt that is not secured thereby, immediately prior to such transaction);
     (d) any Lien on property existing immediately prior to the time of acquisition thereof (provided that such Lien is not incurred in anticipation of such acquisition and does not extend beyond the property subject thereto, or secure any Debt that is not secured thereby, immediately prior to such acquisition);
     (e) Liens to secure Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price of, or the cost of construction on or improvement of, the property subject to such Liens, provided, however, that (A) the principal amount of any Debt secured by such a Lien does not exceed 100% of such price or cost, (B) such Lien does not extend to or cover any other property other than such item of property and any improvements on such item and (C) such Lien must be created no later than 12 months after such purchase or the completion of such construction or installation of such improvements;

     (b) At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article 5 provided, the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.04. No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Other Remedies.
     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.

The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction.
Control by Majority.
     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any such direction with respect to the Securities of such series, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for determining the Holders of outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such direction.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Section 5.14. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities of any series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities of such series, including without limitation, any Holder that revoked its consent in accordance with this Section.

     (c) . The entire outstanding principal of the Notes due 2013 shall be payable on June 1, 2013 and the entire outstanding principal of the Notes due 2018 shall be payable on June 1, 2018.
Maturity Date
     (d) .
Interest Rate
          (i) The rate at which the Notes due 2013 shall bear interest shall be 5.900% per annum and the rate at which the Notes due 2018 shall bear interest shall be 6.650% per annum, in each case, subject to Section 2.02(d)(ii); the date from which interest shall accrue on the Notes shall be May 22, 2008, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for; the Interest Payment Dates for the Notes shall be June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2008; the interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, will be paid, in immediately available funds, to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be May 15 or November 15, as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

provided
however
          (ii) The interest rate payable on the Notes of each series will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, in the manner described below.
     If the rating from Moody's of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
     If the rating from S&P of the Notes of a series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes of such series will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes of such series on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
     If at any time the interest rate on the Notes of a series has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P, as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of that series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Notes of that series will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes of that series equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the applicable ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's subsequently increases its rating of the Notes of any series to Baa3 or higher, and S&P increases its rating to BBB- or higher the interest rate on the Notes of that series will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rate on the Notes of each series will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the Notes of that series become rated A3 and A- or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency).
     Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate payable for the Notes of a series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes of a series exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance.
     If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes of that series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes of a series shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating of the Notes of a series, the interest rate on the Notes of that series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes of that series on the date of their issuance.
     Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
     If the interest rate payable on the Notes of a series is increased as described in this Section 2.02(d)(ii), then the term "interest", as used in this First Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes of the applicable series, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
 
     (e) . The currency of denomination of the Notes is United States Dollars. Payment of principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Notes will be made in United States Dollars.
Currency
     Section 2.03
. Optional Redemption.
     (a) The provisions of Article 11 of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
     (b) At any time and from time to time, the Notes of each series will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes of the applicable series, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of Principal Amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points for the Notes due 2013, or at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points for the Notes due 2018, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date for the applicable series of Notes.
     (c) On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes of either series, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of such series or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price. On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes of that series, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent, or the Trustee, funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Notes of a series to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed will be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided however that no Notes of a Principal Amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
     (d) Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes of the applicable series to be redeemed provided however that if the Trustee is asked to give such notice it shall be notified in writing of such request at least 15 days prior to the date of the giving of such notice. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate Principal Amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased up to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the "").

Lexmark reports second quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky., July 22, 2008  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2008. Second-quarter revenue was $1.14 billion, down 6 percent compared to revenue of $1.21 billion last year. Second-quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.89. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 would have been $0.96 excluding $0.07 per share for restructuring-related activities. Second-quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2007 would have been $0.65 excluding $0.02 per share net benefit for restructuring-related activities.
During the second quarter we continued the strategic shift that we started in late 2007. EPS grew year to year in 2Q and we had good cash generation performance. Overall, we have more work to do to continue to implement our strategy and to drive growth in higher usage segments, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. A key element is the introduction of industry-leading products and technology, which has enabled us to win some important large enterprise accounts recently and resulted in our new Professional Series and Home and Student Series inkjet products announced yesterday.
Second-quarter 2008 business segment revenue of $763 million grew 4 percent year to year. Consumer segment revenue of $376 million declined 21 percent compared to a year ago primarily due to the strategic changes announced last October and the slowdown in the inkjet market. Second-quarter 2008 gross profit margin was 36.6 percent, operating expense was $316 million, the operating income margin was 8.9 percent, operating income was $101 million and net earnings were $84 million. Second-quarter 2008 operating income includes $9 million pretax charges in connection with the companys restructuring-related actions.
Second-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 30.6 percent, operating expense was $305 million, the operating income margin was 5.4 percent, operating income was $66 million, and net earnings were $64 million. Second-quarter 2007 operating income included $5 million restructuring-related pretax charges.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring-related charges, second-quarter 2008:
 
 
The company ended the quarter with $1.328 billion in cash and current marketable securities. Second-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $135 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $45 million. Lexmark repurchased $158 million (4.5 million shares) of stock during the second quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $887 million at quarter end.
Lexmark announced a plan today to enhance the efficiency of its inkjet cartridge manufacturing operations by further consolidating manufacturing capacity for the companys inkjet supplies. This restructuring plan is for the closure of one of the companys inkjet supplies manufacturing facilities in Mexico. This action is expected to impact approximately 650 positions by the end of 2008. Most of the impacted positions are being moved to a lower-cost country. The company estimates that this 2008 action will result in total pretax cost of approximately $24 million ($8 million cash cost), with an approximate $20 million impact in 2008. Pretax cost of $3 million impacted second-quarter 2008 results. Total savings from this restructuring are expected to be about $9 million annually beginning in 2009.

Item 1.01.          Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  The Company now has approximately $613 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on August 28, 2008, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement or Agreement) with Citibank, N.A (Citibank).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $150 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Citibank.  The Agreement requires Citibank to deliver to the Company on September 3, 2008, 3,455,285 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $36.90, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on August 28, 2008.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Citibank under the Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Citibank, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Citibank as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2008.  The payment of $150 million by the Company to Citibank for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available cash.
The preceding description of the ASR Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by the ASR Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference.

Lexmark reports third quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 21, 2008  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2008. Third-quarter revenue was $1.13 billion, down 5 percent compared to revenue of $1.20 billion last year. Third-quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.42. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 would have been $0.63 excluding $0.21 per share for restructuring-related activities. Third-quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per share were $0.48. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2007 would have been $0.60 excluding $0.12 per share for restructuring-related activities.
Although we encountered increasing economic weakness during the third quarter, our results were in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, with good growth in our branded laser units and laser supplies, an improved performance in our U.S. laser business, strong growth in laser multifunction devices, and an ongoing R&D investment that resulted in the introduction of 38 new laser products yesterday, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. As we look forward, despite a more difficult global economic environment, we expect to continue to make progress with our strategy to improve our focus and penetration in the higher usage market segments. Our strong balance sheet and good liquidity, with more than $1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and a long track record of good cash generation, positions us well to invest in the future and to compete effectively, even during challenging times.
Third-quarter 2008 business segment revenue of $760 million grew 4 percent year to year. Consumer segment revenue of $371 million declined 21 percent compared to a year ago, primarily due to the strategic changes announced last October and the slowdown in the inkjet market. Third-quarter 2008 gross profit margin was 32.5 percent, operating expense was $314 million, the operating income margin was 4.8 percent, operating income was $54 million and net earnings were $37 million. Third-quarter 2008 operating income includes $25 million pretax charges in connection with the companys restructuring-related actions.
Third-quarter 2007 gross profit margin was 27.8 percent, operating expense was $312 million, the operating income margin was 1.7 percent, operating income was $20 million, and net earnings were $45 million. Third-quarter 2007 operating income included $15 million restructuring-related pretax charges.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring-related charges, third-quarter 2008:
The company ended the quarter with $1.086 billion in cash and current marketable securities. Third-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $117 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $58 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $56 million. Lexmark repurchased $274 million (7.7 million shares) of stock during the third quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $613 million at quarter end.
38 New Laser Printer and MFP Models Target Pages in Businesses of All Sizes
Yesterday, in one of the broadest product introductions in its history, Lexmark announced 38 new laser printer and multifunction product (MFP) models specifically designed to meet the needs of users in heavy page-generating areas of large enterprises and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs).
The new Lexmark C540n Series of color laser printers and Lexmark X540 Series of color laser MFPs were added to the companys award winning color laser line yesterday. Already, the C540n, C543dn and C544 color laser models were named Editors Choice by Better Buys for Business in its . With the C540 Series best-in-class rated color print speeds, best-in-class print quality, a small, yet robust footprint, and numerous, standard environmentally conscious features, the Lexmark C540n Series and Lexmark X540 Series are compelling values in the high growth color laser and color laser MFP segments, respectively.

With the introduction of the Lexmark T650 Series of monochrome laser printers and X650 Series of monochrome laser MFPs, the company significantly strengthened and updated its core line of workhorse, workgroup monochrome lasers and MFPs.

Looking Forward
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company expects revenue to be down in the low- to mid-teens percentage range year over year. It expects fourth-quarter 2008 GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Restructuring-related costs and expenses are expected to be approximately $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Item 1.01.      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $506 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on October 21, 2008, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement or Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $100 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Bank of America.  The Agreement requires Bank of America to deliver to the Company on October 24, 2008, 3,306,107 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $25.71, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on October 21, 2008.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Bank of America under the Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Bank of America, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Bank of America as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2008.  The payment of $100 million by the Company to Bank of America for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available cash.
The preceding description of the ASR Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by the ASR Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference.

When considering information described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Non-Defaulting Party may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized.  Third parties supplying quotations pursuant to clause (i) above or market data pursuant to clause (ii) above may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.

The Company estimates the 2009 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $45 million, all of which will require cash.  Pre-tax charges of approximately $20 million will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The Company expects the 2009 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of 2009.

Lexmark announces revised fourth quarter 2008 financial outlook, 2009 Restructuring Plan
LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 13, 2009  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) announced that the weakening global economic environment impacted Lexmarks fourth quarter 2008 operating performance, which will be lower than expected.
The company currently expects its fourth quarter revenue to decline about 17 percent year over year. As compared to the company's October 2008 fourth quarter guidance of a revenue decline in the low to mid teens range, revenue has been negatively impacted by lower laser and inkjet hardware unit sales and currency rate shifts during the quarter.
The companys earnings per share for the quarter have been impacted by several factors including:
Lexmark now expects fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.24 per share. Fourth quarter restructuring related charges will be about $0.52 per share, or about $0.22 per share higher than expected in the October 2008 guidance primarily due to this 2009 Restructuring Plan. The companys fourth quarter results are expected to include a tax benefit of about $0.30 per share. EPS excluding restructuring related charges are now expected to be $0.71 to $0.76 with the lower operating income impact being offset by the tax benefit. This compares to the October 2008 guidance range for EPS excluding restructuring of $0.70 to $0.80.
The 2009 Restructuring Plan is expected to impact about 375 positions. The company expects the 2009 Restructuring Plan will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $45 million. Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan were $20 million. Lexmark expects the 2009 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of 2009 and currently expects total annualized cost savings of $50 million when completed, with approximately $40 million in savings in 2009.
Looking ahead, the company expects some of the same factors that impacted the fourth quarter to also impact the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter the company currently expects a revenue decline in the mid to high teens percentage range, and GAAP
 
 
 
 
earnings per share to be around $0.52 to $0.62, or $0.65 to $0.75 excluding $0.13 restructuring related charges.

Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 include a net benefit in the companys provision for income taxes of $0.29 per share. Excluding $0.52 per share for restructuring-related activities, earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been $0.75. Fourth quarter 2007 GAAP earnings per share were $1.04. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 would have been $1.29 excluding $0.25 per share for restructuring-related activities.
In response to the current market conditions, Lexmark continues to take actions that will reduce our fixed infrastructure and business support costs, which are projected to generate savings of over $100 million in 2009, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.  We have a conservative capital structure, a solid balance sheet, with nearly $1 billion in cash and current marketable securities, and a long history of good cash generation, all of which positions us well to prudently invest in the future and successfully compete.
In addition, we continue to focus on helping our customers generate significant savings in their output costs through our growing managed print services business and innovative, award-winning products, Curlander said.
Fourth quarter business segment revenue of $718 million declined 10 percent year to year. Consumer segment revenue of $366 million declined 28 percent compared to a year ago.

Full-year Results
2008 revenue was $4.53 billion, down 9 percent compared to revenue of $4.97 billion in 2007. 2008 business segment revenue declined 1 percent to $2.98 billion, and consumer segment revenue declined 22 percent to $1.55 billion. 2008 GAAP earnings per share were $2.69.

Depreciation and amortization in 2008 was $205 million. The company repurchased approximately 17.5 million shares of its stock during the year for $555 million.
New Lasers Earn Nearly 70 Industry Awards and Accolades in Quarter
Each of the 38 laser models announced in October 2008 was the recipient of a product award from a third party reviewer of document imaging equipment.

ITEM: Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers: Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On February 20, 2009, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) granted annual incentive compensation awards with respect to 2009 to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Incentive Compensation Plan).  The Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by stockholders on April 22, 2004 and is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.  The maximum award which may be earned under the Incentive Compensation Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of operating income for the one-year performance period.  The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a participant based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, revenue, operating income, cash cycle days, divisional revenue, divisional operating income, divisional cash cycle days and individual performance.  The Compensation Committee has also established a threshold performance measure of cash flows from operations excluding property, plant and equipment, but including any restructuring amounts.  The threshold, minimum, target and maximum award amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Incentive Compensation Plan, are set forth in the following table.
Also on February 20, 2009, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Dr. Curlander, a long-term incentive opportunity comprised 60% of performance-based restricted stock units and 40% of time-based restricted stock units.  The Compensation Committee believes that a long-term incentive opportunity comprised of a combination of performance-based and time-based restricted stock units will motivate the Named Executive Officers on the achievement of key performance goals, while maintaining a retention focus. The performance measure for the performance-based restricted stock units is return on net assets, excluding cash, but including any restructuring amounts.  The performance period is January 1, 2009  December 31, 2009 (the Performance Period).  The Compensation Committee had intended to award Dr. Curlander an equity-based long-term incentive award for 2009.  However, Dr. Curlander requested that the Committee not award a long-term incentive opportunity to him for 2009 in an effort to control costs during this current economic downturn,
 
while allowing other individuals to receive awards.  The Compensation Committee expects to consider Dr. Curlander for future long-term incentive awards.
The time-based restricted stock unit awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 20, 2011, February 20, 2012 and February 20, 2013, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date.  The performance-based restricted stock units to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined in 2010, with vesting and settlement of any earned performance-based restricted stock units to occur in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 20, 2011, February 20, 2012 and February 20, 2013, based on the Named Executive Officers continued employment on each vesting date.  The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the Performance Period to earn the performance-based restricted stock units.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason will result in forfeiture of the award.  The vesting of the performance-based restricted stock units after the end of the Performance Period will be accelerated in the event of the Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement occurring after the completion of the Performance Period.  The time-based restricted stock units awarded, as well as the minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based restricted stock unit awards are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2008 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2009.

First quarter revenue was $944 million, down 20 percent compared to revenue of $1.18 billion last year as weak global economic conditions negatively impacted demand for both hardware and supplies.
 
 
 
First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.75. Excluding $0.14 per share for restructuring-related activities, earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.89. First quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share were $1.07. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 would have been $1.16 excluding $0.09 per share for restructuring-related activities.
While EPS were above our expectation in the quarter, market conditions continue to negatively impact both Lexmark and the overall distributed printing market, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Despite this, we are continuing to execute well on our key strategic initiatives to reach higher page generating segments of the market and to strengthen the company during this economic downturn.
During the quarter we made good progress on our cost and expense reduction initiatives. Key strategic milestones during the quarter include the significant expansion of our laser line, particularly in laser multifunction devices and color, the expansion of our U.S. retail distribution, achieving growth this quarter in our branded high end inkjet all-in-ones, and the continuing good growth of our laser multifunction devices," Curlander said.
First quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division revenue of $599 million declined 19 percent year to year. Imaging Solutions Division revenue of $345 million declined 20 percent compared to a year ago.
In the first quarter of 2009:

Capital expenditures for the quarter were $68 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $44 million.

The new Lexmark X264dn, X360 Series and X460 Series pack powerful productivity and performance into compact devices for small and medium workgroups in any size organization. Between the fall of 2008 and spring 2009 announcements, the company will introduce 70 new laser models building upon its world class products and solutions and significantly expanding Lexmarks presence in high usage MFP and color laser segments.

Important Milestone Achieved With U.S. Retail Expansion
Lexmark announced during the first quarter that it is increasing and broadening the company's distribution of award-winning printers at the following retailers: Staples, Office Depot, OfficeMax, InkStop, MicroCenter and Fry's. The announcement of these retail partnerships is a key milestone in Lexmarks strategy to become a premier printing solutions provider for the small business marketplace and increases the companys ability to reach higher usage customers. The products being placed at these locations, consisting primarily of the company's Professional Series line of printers and all-in-ones (AIOs), were developed to meet the needs of small office, home office, and small and medium business professionals. The Professional Series product line includes wireless color AIOs, as well as monochrome and color lasers.
 
Lexmark Announces Additional Restructuring Actions
As part of the companys ongoing plan to consolidate manufacturing capacity and reduce costs and expenses worldwide, Lexmark today also announced additional
 
 
restructuring actions. These actions include the planned closure of 
its inkjet cartridge
manufacturing facility in Jurez, Mexico, by the end of the first quarter of 2010 as well as the continued restructuring of the companys worldwide work force. This April 2009 Restructuring Plan is expected to impact about 360 positions, with approximately 270 coming from the closure of the Jurez, Mexico, facility. The company expects the April 2009 Restructuring Plan will result in pretax charges of approximately $50 million with cash costs estimated at $10 million. Restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009 related to the April 2009 Restructuring Plan were $2 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Lexmark reports second quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky., July 21, 2009 Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter revenue was $905 million, down 21 percent compared to revenue of $1.14 billion last year as weak global economic conditions continued to negatively impact demand for both hardware and supplies.
Second quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.22. Excluding $0.33 per share for restructuring-related activities, earnings per share for the second quarter of 2009 would have been $0.55. Second quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share were $0.89. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 would have been $0.96 excluding $0.07 per share for restructuring-related activities.
While second quarter results were in line with our expectation, global economic conditions continue to negatively impact Lexmark and the overall distributed printing market, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Despite this, we made good progress during the quarter on our key strategic initiatives in both divisions.
Specifically, we continued the rollout of new laser products with the introduction of the new Lexmark C730/X730 Series of color laser printers and MFPs. Our ongoing initiatives in color laser and laser MFPs drove good unit growth in both of these segments during the quarter.
The progress of our inkjet technology development team culminated in the announcement last week regarding our new line of inkjet AIOs featuring Lexmarks new Vizix inkjet technology, including three new Web-connected, touch screen, business focused AIOs," Curlander said.
Second quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division revenue of $624 million declined 18 percent year to year. Imaging Solutions Division revenue of $281 million declined 25 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2009:
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring-related charges, in the second quarter of 2009:
The company ended the quarter with $810 million in cash and current marketable securities. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $84 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $79 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $63 million.
New Lasers Strengthen Business Lineup
The most award-winning line of laser printers in the United States was strengthened in the second quarter with the introduction of the companys new Lexmark C730 Series of color laser printers, Lexmark X730 Series of color laser multifunction products (MFPs), and the Lexmark X204n monochrome laser MFP.
1
The laser products and solutions announced over the past three quarters represent the most extensive series of laser product introductions in the companys history. The new models have dramatically increased the breadth and strength of Lexmarks laser printer-
 
 
 
based solutions and services offerings, better positioning the company to secure high value product installations to capture profitable supplies and services annuities in print-intensive workgroup environments.
Lexmark Wins Multi-Year Global Services Deal With BASF
During the quarter, Lexmark announced a multi-year global services agreement with leading chemical company BASF. Following a rigorous competitive review, Lexmark was selected because of its thorough approach to total cost of ownership, its worldwide service and support capabilities and its comprehensive set of product features. The contract, as part of a Managed Print Services initiative, will enable BASF to significantly reduce its output costs. Lexmark has a long track record of helping its customers "Print Less, Save More." This message continues to resonate with large multinational corporations like BASF that wish to reduce their paper use, improve process efficiency, and reduce cost.
Lexmark Previews 2009 Inkjet Product Line
Last week, the company announced information about its fall 2009 inkjet all-in-one (AIO) product line to be officially released on Sept. 1, 2009. Lexmark will deliver eight new AIO inkjets ideal for small to medium-sized businesses. The new line includes three Web-connected touch screen AIOs, which will be available at price points ranging from $199 to $399, Lexmark's new Vizix technology that includes separate ink cartridges, wireless capability across the entire line, and the new Eco Mode, which allows users to save paper and energy. Product shipment is scheduled to begin in September. Lexmark will showcase its lineup of business-ready inkjet AIOs at the Lexmark securities analyst open house on Tuesday, Sept. 8, in New York City.

Looking Forward
In the third quarter of 2009, the company currently expects revenue to be down slightly sequentially, and GAAP earnings per share to be around $0.22 to $0.32, or $0.40 to $0.50 excluding $0.18 restructuring-related charges. GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter of 2008 were $0.42, or $0.63 excluding $0.21 per share for restructuring-related activities.

Item 1.01.                                Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a $275 million 3-year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on and effective as of August 17, 2009 (the "Effective Date") by and among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and Citibank, N.A. and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto.
The Credit Agreement provides for a 3-year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility that includes the availability of swingline loans and multicurrency letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $300 million. Interest on all borrowings under the Credit Agreement is determined based upon several alternative interest rates, including a rate based on LIBOR.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including those relating to (a) a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA/consolidated interest expense) of not less than 4.0 to 1.0 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness/consolidated EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement limits, among other things, the Company's indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business.
The Credit Agreement includes usual and customary events of default (subject to applicable grace periods) for facilities of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments shall automatically terminate.
The Credit Agreement also includes collateral terms providing that in the event the Companys credit ratings decrease to certain levels the Company will be required to secure on behalf of the lenders first priority security interests in the Companys owned U.S. assets. Said collateral arrangements will be released upon the Company achieving certain defined improvements in its credit ratings.
As of the Effective Date, there are no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's current $300 million 5-year Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into on January 20, 2005, by the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Fleet National Bank and Citibank, N.A. as Co-Syndication Agents, Keybank National Association and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto (the "Terminated Credit
 
 
 
Agreement"), which agreement was terminated on and effective as of the Effective Date of the Credit Agreement. The Terminated Credit Agreement allowed for swingline loans and the issuance of multicurrency letters of credit under the credit facility. Interest on all borrowings was determined based upon several alternative rates, including a rate based on LIBOR. The Terminated Credit Agreement contained certain financial covenants, including those relating to the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.

(d)
 
.

Participations
 
.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if the Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Borrower, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by the Issuing Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, such payment shall, automatically and without any notice, be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing (or, if so requested by the Borrower, a Swingline Loan) in an equivalent Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement and the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due and, for any reason, the applicable Lender(s) are unable to make or have no obligation to make the ABR Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan (as applicable) contemplated in the previous sentence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  If the Borrowers reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the

Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable exchange rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.
 
(f)
 
.  The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) whether the account party in respect of such LC Disbursement is the Borrower or any Subsidiary or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
Obligations Absolute
provided
 
(g)
 
.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
 
.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is

Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(i)
 
.  The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of the Issuing Bank
 
.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders (that are non-Defaulting Lenders) with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in a Foreign Currency that the Borrower is not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in the applicable Foreign Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Foreign Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the applicable exchange rates of the Administrative Agent on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the Borrower.  The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11.2.  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure  representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations.

.  In the event that the Loans become immediately due and payable on any date pursuant to Article VII, all amounts (i) that the Borrower is at the time or thereafter becomes required to reimburse or otherwise pay to the Administrative Agent in respect of LC Disbursements made under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts in respect of which the Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to paragraph (j) above, if such cash collateral was deposited in the applicable Foreign Currency to the extent so deposited or applied), (ii) that the Lenders are at the time or thereafter become required to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter becomes required to distribute to the Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section in respect of unreimbursed LC Disbursements made under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) of each Lenders participation in any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit under which an LC Disbursement has been made shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the Dollar Amount, calculated using the Administrative Agents currency exchange rates on such date (or in the case of any LC Disbursement made after such date, on the date such LC Disbursement is made), of such amounts.  On and after such conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of the obligations described in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder.

provided
provided
 
                               (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the equivalent Borrowing.

If any interest is paid by the Borrower pursuant to this
 
28 
 
 
Section 2.07 with respect to any amount funded by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall not be required to pay interest on such amount pursuant to this Agreement to the relevant non-funding Lender in respect of such period.
 
SECTION 2.08.
 
.    Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
(a)  
 
(b)
 
To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election (by telephone in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars or by irrevocable written notice (via an Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i) change the currency of any Borrowing or (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
 
(c)
 
Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(ii)
 
the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)
 
whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
 
(iv)
 
if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
(d)
 
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
29 
 
 
(e)
 
If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless (x) such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.11 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent an Interest Election Request requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Borrowing continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for the same or another Interest Period.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (and any such Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be redenominated in Dollars at the time of such conversion) at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

provided
 
(c)
 
The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a

if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.23(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; or
 
(v)

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

On December 30, 2002 (02 action) and March 16, 2004 (04 action), Lexmark International, Inc. (filed claims against Static Control Components, Inc. (SCC) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (the District Court) alleging violation of Lexmarks intellectual property and state law rights.  Similar claims in a separate action were filed by Lexmark in the District Court against David Abraham and Clarity Imaging Technologies, Inc. (Clarity) on October 8, 2004.  SCC and Clarity have filed counterclaims against Lexmark in the District Court alleging that Lexmark engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws.  SCC has stated in its legal documents that it is seeking approximately $17.8 million to $19.5 million in damages for Lexmarks alleged anticompetitive conduct and approximately $1 billion for Lexmarks alleged violation of the Lanham Act.  Clarity has not stated a damage dollar amount.  SCC and Clarity are seeking treble damages, attorney fees, costs and injunctive relief.  On September 28, 2006, the District Court dismissed the counterclaims filed by SCC alleging that Lexmark engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws.  On October 13, 2006, SCC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the District Courts Order dismissing SCCs claims, or in the alternative, to amend its pleadings, which the District Court denied on June 1, 2007.  On October 13, 2006, the District Court issued an order to stay the action brought against David Abraham and Clarity until a final judgment or settlement is entered into in the consolidated 02 and 04 actions.  On June 20, 2007, the District Court Judge ruled that SCC directly infringed one of Lexmarks patents-in-suit.  On June 22, 2007, the jury returned a verdict that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmarks patents-in-suit. As to SCCs defense that Lexmark has committed patent misuse, in an advisory, non-binding capacity, the jury did find some company conduct constituted misuse.  In the jurys advisory, non-binding findings, the jury also found that the relevant market was the cartridge market rather than the printer market and that Lexmark had unreasonably restrained competition in that market.  On October 3, 2008, the District Court Judge issued a memorandum opinion denying various motions made by Lexmark that sought to reverse the jurys finding that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmarks patents-in-suit.  The District Court Judge did, however, grant Lexmarks motion that SCCs equitable defenses, including patent misuse, were moot.  As a result, the jurys advisory findings on misuse, including the jurys finding that the relevant market was the cartridge market rather than the printer market and that Lexmark had unreasonably restrained competition in that market, were not adopted by the District Court.  On March 31, 2009, the District Court granted SCCs Motion for Reconsideration of an earlier Order that had found Lexmarks terms used on certain supply items that provide for an up-front discount in exchange for an agreement to use the supply item only once were supported by patent law.  The District Court Judge ruled that after the U.S. Supreme Courts most recent statement of the law regarding patent exhaustion, Lexmark may not invoke patent law to enforce these terms but state contract law may still be invoked.  A final judgment for the 02 action and the 04 action has not yet been entered by the District Court.
 
 
 
Copyright fees
Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and/or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have taken action to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content.  Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices.  The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country.  Lexmark has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the risks related to the copyright fee issues currently pending.  The financial impact on Lexmark, which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes, Lexmarks and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and Lexmarks ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon competitive market conditions, remains uncertain.  As of June 30, 2009, Lexmark has accrued approximately $67 million for pending copyright fee issues, including litigation proceedings, local legislative initiatives and/or negotiations with the parties involved.  The remaining balance accrued for copyright fees relates to amounts Lexmark has agreed to pay to various parties, including a recent settlement that is discussed further below.
As of June 30, 2009, approximately $56 million of the $67 million accrued for the pending copyright fee issues was related to single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007.  On December 6, 2007, the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal Supreme Court) issued a judgment in litigation brought by VerwertungsGesellschaft Wort (VG Wort), a collection society representing certain copyright holders, against Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), finding that single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007 were not subject to the law authorizing the German copyright fee levy (German Federal Supreme Court, file reference I ZR 94/05).  Lexmark and VG Wort entered into an agreement pursuant to which both VG Wort and Lexmark agreed to be bound by the outcome of the VG Wort/HP litigation.  VG Wort filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, the Constitutional Court) challenging the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court.  Lexmark believes the amount accrued represents its best estimate of the copyright fee issues currently pending.

Credit Agreement
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the extensions of credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that each of the Guarantors (constituting all of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower required to execute this Guaranty pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement) execute and deliver this Guaranty, whereby each of the Guarantors shall guarantee the payment when due of all Obligations; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of the direct and indirect financial and other support that the Borrower has provided, and such direct and indirect financial and other support as the Borrower may in the future provide, to the Guarantors, and in order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into the Credit Agreement, each of the Guarantors is willing to guarantee the Obligations of the Borrower;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
SECTION 1.  .  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined herein have, as used herein, the respective meanings provided for therein.
Definitions
SECTION 2.  .  Each of the Guarantors represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been renewed at the time of the making, conversion or continuation of any Loan or issuance of any Letter of Credit) that:
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
(A)  It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
 
 
 
(B)  The Transactions applicable to it are within such Guarantors organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational actions and, if required, actions by equity holders.

In addition to the foregoing, each of the Guarantors covenants that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any amount payable under the Credit Agreement or any other Guaranteed Obligations shall remain unpaid, it will, and, if necessary, will enable the Borrower to, fully comply with those covenants and agreements of the Borrower applicable to such Guarantor set forth in the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 3.  .

Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that this Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of payment and is not a guaranty of collection.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be due and payable in the same currency as such Guaranteed Obligation is denominated, but if currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that such currency (the ) no longer exists or the relevant Guarantor is not able to make payment in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Guarantor hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of payment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that each Guarantor takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.

Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the Guarantors (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) waive any right to enforce any remedy which the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent now have or may hereafter have against the Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, and the Guarantors waive any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent to secure the payment or performance of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other liability of the Borrower to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations or the Issuing Bank.  Should any Guarantor have the right, notwithstanding the foregoing, to exercise its subrogation rights, each Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably (A) subordinates any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off that such Guarantor may have to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and (B) to the extent permitted by law, waives any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Guaranty, and that the Administrative Agent, the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this Section 7(A).
              (B)  Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness.  Each Guarantor agrees that any and all claims of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor hereunder (each an ) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), any endorser, obligor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any of its properties shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Guaranteed Obligations; that, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may receive payments of principal and interest from any Obligor with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights, if any, of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied (in cash) and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document, any Swap Agreement or any Banking Services Agreement have been terminated.  If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an ), any

Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by the applicable Guarantor upon or with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior to the satisfaction of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall forthwith deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of the Guarantor where necessary), for application to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Guarantor as the property of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations.  If any such Guarantor fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same.  Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than the contingent indemnity obligations) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor.

Item 2.05.                      Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
As part of Lexmarks ongoing plans to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all of our operations, the company announced additional restructuring actions today.  The company continues its focus on refining its selling and service organization, reducing its general and administrative expenses, consolidating its cartridge manufacturing capacity, and enhancing the efficiency of its supply chain infrastructure. The actions taken will reduce cost and expense across the organization, with a focus in manufacturing and supply chain, service delivery overhead, marketing and sales support, corporate overhead and development positions as well as reducing cost through consolidation of facilities in supply chain and cartridge manufacturing.  The company expects these actions to be principally complete by the end of the first quarter of 2011.
These October 2009 actions are expected to impact about 825 positions worldwide and will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $120 million with approximately $55 million to be incurred in 2009, and $65 million in 2010  2011.  The company incurred $33 million in charges related to this restructuring in 3Q09.  The company expects the total cash cost of this plan to be approximately $105 million.
Lexmark expects these October 2009 actions to generate savings of approximately $2 million in 2009, $70 million in 2010 and ongoing savings beginning in 2011 of approximately $110 million.  These ongoing savings should be split approximately 60% to operating expense and 40% to cost of goods sold.  Ongoing cash savings of approximately $105 million are expected beginning in 2011.

Lexmark reports third quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky., October 20, 2009 Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter revenue of $958 million increased 6 percent sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2009 and decreased 15 percent compared to the same quarter last year.
Third quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.13. Excluding $0.52 per share for restructuring-related activities which includes $0.34 per share for the additional restructuring-related activities the company is announcing today, earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 would have been $0.65. Third quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share were $0.42. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 would have been $0.63 excluding $0.21 per share for restructuring-related activities.
Stronger than expected customer demand drove good sequential growth for Lexmark, exceeding our expectations in the third quarter, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
We also continued to improve the fundamentals of the business with well received new product introductions in both the inkjet and laser segments. We continued significant expense reductions now totaling $180 million year to date and today announced additional expense and cost actions. We delivered a strong sequential increase in our cash flow, and our overall financial position remains strong with over $900 million in cash and current marketable securities, Curlander added.
 
Third quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division revenue of $654 million was up 5 percent sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2009 and declined 14 percent year to year. Imaging Solutions Division revenue of $304 million was up 8 percent sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2009 and declined 18 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
 
In the third quarter of 2009:
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring-related charges, in the third quarter of 2009:
The company ended the quarter with $909 million in cash and current marketable securities. Third quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $147 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $51 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $52 million.
New Lasers Broaden, Strengthen Laser Workgroup Lineup
Earlier this month, Lexmark announced ten new color and monochrome laser devices further strengthening and broadening Lexmark's workgroup line to meet a wider range of customer needs. This announcement includes the introduction of another industry first with a new solutions-ready, touch screen laser printer. Lexmark's T656dne monochrome laser printer is the industry's first single-function monochrome A4 (8.5 inch x 11 inch) laser printer with a touch screen, providing businesses with large workgroups the ability to tap into a powerful solutions platform. The innovative features and advanced workflow capabilities of the Lexmark T656dne enable Lexmark to penetrate a new category of higher price point monochrome single function laser printers.
The laser products and solutions announced by Lexmark over the past year represent the most extensive series of laser product introductions in the companys history. These new models have dramatically increased the breadth and strength of Lexmarks laser printer-based solutions and services offerings, better positioning the company to secure high value product installations to capture profitable supplies and services annuities in print-intensive workgroup environments.
Lexmark Announces Additional Restructuring Actions
Lexmark is announcing additional restructuring initiatives designed to streamline its world-wide organization to improve operating efficiencies and effectiveness. The company continues to focus on refining its selling and service organization, reducing its general and administrative expenses, consolidating its cartridge manufacturing capacity, and enhancing the efficiency of its supply chain infrastructure. These moves will allow
 
 
 
the company to better deal with the challenging worldwide economic conditions that continue to exist.  Once completed, the initiatives will improve the companys operating fundamentals and position the company to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.
This October 2009 plan includes reductions primarily in the areas of manufacturing and supply chain, service delivery overhead, marketing and sales support, corporate overhead, and development. The company expects these actions to be principally complete by the end of the first quarter of 2011.
These October 2009 actions are expected to impact about 825 positions worldwide and will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $120 million with approximately $33 million incurred in the third quarter of 2009. Lexmark expects these October 2009 actions will generate savings of approximately $70 million in 2010 and ongoing savings of $110 million beginning in 2011 with approximately 60 percent impacting operating expense and 40 percent impacting cost of goods sold.
Looking Forward
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company currently expects revenue to be up slightly sequentially and GAAP earnings per share to be around $0.11 to $0.21, or $0.50 to $0.60 excluding $0.39 restructuring-related charges. GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $0.23, or $0.75 excluding $0.52 per share for restructuring-related activities.

Lexmark reports fourth quarter and full year results
LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 2, 2010 Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.07 billion increased 12 percent sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2009 and decreased 1 percent compared to the same quarter last year.
Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.76. Excluding $0.40 per share for restructuring-related activities, earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 would have been $1.16. Fourth quarter 2008 GAAP earnings per share were $0.23. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have been $0.75 excluding $0.52 per share for restructuring-related activities.
"Lexmarks fourth quarter results were significantly better than anticipated, reflecting strong sequential improvements in customer demand, which were enhanced by the strength of the new products we introduced over the past year, said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark's chairman and chief executive officer.
"During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our business model through the implementation of our restructuring and expense reductions, which delivered over $200 million of expense savings in 2009. These actions, along with the increased customer demand, helped us to deliver strong sequential and year over year improvements in operating income and cash flow. Our ongoing financial position remains strong with over $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities," Curlander said.
 
Fourth quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division revenue of $748 million grew 14 percent sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2009 and grew 4 percent year to year. Imaging Solutions Division revenue of $325 million grew 7 percent sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2009 and declined 11 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
 
The company ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. Fourth quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $257 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $56 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2009:

New Products Strengthen Presence in Target Segments
The laser products and solutions announced by Lexmark over the past 15 months represent the most extensive series of laser product introductions in the companys history. These new models have dramatically increased the breadth and strength of Lexmarks laser printer-based devices, solutions and services offerings, better positioning the company to secure high value product installations to capture profitable supplies and services annuities in print-intensive workgroup environments.
In 2009, Lexmarks lasers won more than three times as many laser awards in the U.S. as any of its competitors. Throughout the year the company continued to see good growth in its managed print services business as it continues to help enterprise customers lower their costs, improve their document-based processes and reduce their environmental footprint due to printing.

In 2009, Lexmark continued moving the deployment of its award-winning inkjet technology upstream to a higher page generating, business focused customer set. Lexmark significantly expanded its retail footprint in the office superstore and regional consumer electronics store segments in North America. In the third quarter, the company launched a line of higher end all-in-ones focused on meeting the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Lexmarks inkjet products became the second most awarded line in the U.S. in 2009, a significant improvement over 2008, reflecting the ongoing evolution and improvement in Lexmarks new inkjet products. Notably, the Lexmark Platinum Pro905 was recently named a CES Engineering Innovation Honoree.

Looking Forward
In the first quarter of 2010, the company currently expects revenue to be up slightly year on year and GAAP earnings per share to be around $0.64 to $0.74, based on an effective tax rate of 24 percent, or $0.80 to $0.90 excluding $0.16 per share restructuring-related charges. GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2009 were $0.75 with an effective tax rate of 16 percent, or $0.89 excluding $0.14 per share for restructuring-related activities.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On February 23, 2010, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) granted annual incentive compensation award opportunities with respect to the 2010 calendar year (the IC Performance Period) to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Senior Executive IC Plan). The maximum award which may be earned under the Senior Executive IC Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of operating income for the IC Performance Period. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a Named Executive Officer based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives established under the Companys 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan (2010 IC Plan).
Under the 2010 IC Plan, the Compensation Committee has established a Threshold Plan and a Traditional Plan, and the award amount is based on the greater of the Threshold Plan or Traditional Plan, subject to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan.  Under the Traditional Plan, performance measures include revenue, operating income, cash cycle days, divisional revenue, divisional operating income, divisional cash cycle days and individual performance.  Under the Threshold Plan, performance measures include worldwide free cash flow and individual performance.  Each of the Traditional Plan and Threshold Plan performance measures exclude acquisitions. The minimum award opportunity established under the Threshold Plan and the minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the Traditional Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan, are set forth in the following table.
Also on February 23, 2010, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Dr. Curlander, a long-term incentive opportunity comprised 60% of performance-based restricted stock units and 40% of time-based restricted stock units. Dr. Curlanders long-term incentive opportunity is comprised 100% of performance-based restricted stock units.
The performance measure for the performance-based restricted stock units is worldwide free cash flow, excluding acquisitions. The performance period is January 1, 2010  December 31, 2010 (the RSU Performance Period). The performance-based restricted stock units to be
 
awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2011, with vesting and settlement of any earned performance-based restricted stock units to occur in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2011, February 24, 2013 and February 24, 2014, based on the Named Executive Officers continued employment on each vesting date. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the RSU Performance Period to earn the performance-based restricted stock units.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason will result in forfeiture of the award.  The vesting of any earned performance-based restricted stock units after the end of the RSU Performance Period will be accelerated in the event of the Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement occurring after the completion of the RSU Performance Period.
The time-based restricted stock unit awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2012, February 24, 2013 and February 24, 2014, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date. The time-based restricted stock units awarded, as well as the minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based restricted stock unit awards are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2009 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
Lexmark reports first quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky.,Apr. 27, 2010  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2010. First quarter revenue of $1.04 billion increased 10 percent compared to the same quarter last year. First quarter revenue declined 3 percent sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $1.20. Excluding $0.15 per share for restructuring-related activities, earnings per share for the first quarter of 2010 would have been $1.35. First quarter 2009 GAAP earnings per share were $0.75. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.89 excluding $0.14 per share for restructuring-related activities.
"Lexmark's first quarter results were significantly better than expected, reflecting strong customer demand for our hardware and supplies products," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
"In addition to improved market conditions, these strong results were also driven by the many actions we've taken over the last two years to expand and strengthen our product line, to advance our solutions and managed print services business, and to reduce our cost and expense infrastructure," Curlander added.
First quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division (PSSD) revenue of $717 million grew by 20 percent and Imaging Solutions Division (ISD) revenue of $326 million declined 6 percent year to year. Sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, PSSD revenue declined by 4 percent and ISD revenue grew slightly.
The company ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash and current marketable securities. First quarter net cash provided by operating activities of $146 million compared to an $86 million use of cash in the same quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $46 million.

Recent Managed Print Services (MPS) wins highlight Lexmarks competitive strength
During the first quarter, Lexmark and Cummins Inc. announced a multimillion dollar, global MPS agreement for a period of five-and-one-half years. The agreement includes the deployment of color and monochrome laser printers and multifunction products (MFPs) and the management and maintenance of those devices throughout 33 locations worldwide. A second phase of the agreement, underway now, includes extending the Lexmark platform to an additional 40 countries worldwide. "Cummins conducted an extensive review of output technology and services providers and ultimately chose Lexmark because of the company's deep experience with driving large scale and complex global print management initiatives," said Bruce Smith, director of Computing Services at Cummins. Lexmark has already replaced Cummins existing fleet of competitors devices with new Lexmark equipment around the world.
Also during the first quarter, BB&T Corporation awarded an exclusive, five-year MPS contract to Lexmark. Lexmark was evaluated and selected in a strategic sourcing event from among many other printing and imaging providers. As part of the agreement, Lexmark will standardize and optimize the number and type of output devices throughout BB&Ts 1,800+ retail branches and at its headquarters. Lexmark expects to reduce the total number of devices at BB&T from 30,000 competitive devices to approximately 10,000 new Lexmark laser printers and multifunction MFPs in support of the company's cost savings and business initiatives. Lexmarks extensive managed print services capabilities and experience became clear to BB&T during this print optimization project, said Ken Hernandez of Enterprise Spend Management at BB&T. We selected Lexmark because of the companys thought leadership and the clear experience they have to drive this type of initiative successfully. Lexmarks strong technology offering and competitive pricing make them the right choice for BB&T.
New professional series inkjet focused on needs of business users
As part of the companys ongoing strategic shift to focus its inkjet technology on the needs of higher usage business customers, Lexmark introduced a new addition to its award-winning line of professional all-in-one (AIO) inkjet printers during the first quarter. Pinnacle, priced at $299.99, was announced at the Fifth Annual Small Business Summit 2010, where it was immediately awarded a 2010 Hot Tech Demo Award. Like the other Professional Series AIOs in Lexmarks line, Pinnacle is designed to help small to medium-sized businesses increase productivity while saving them time and valuable resources. Additionally, Pinnacle features 4-in-1 capability, a Web-connected, easy-to-navigate 4.3 inch capacitive touch screen, and as highlighted in Lexmarks recently launched national advertising campaign, the worlds lowest-cost black ink.

Item 1.01                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 20, 2010, Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Lexmark), 2010 Paris Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lexmark (Merger Sub), Perceptive Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Perceptive), and a representative of the Perceptive stockholders, as Stockholders Agent, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, merge with and into Perceptive (the Merger) at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Perceptive will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Lexmark will acquire Perceptive,a leading provider of enterprise content management solutions, for total cash consideration of $280 million.  Twenty-eight million dollars ($28,000,000) of the consideration will be placed in escrow for a period of fifteen (15) months following the Effective Time to secure indemnification obligations of Perceptive and its stockholders relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties and the satisfaction of covenants.
 
Each of Lexmark, Merger Sub and Perceptive has made customary representations and warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Perceptives stockholders, (ii) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the absence of any law, order or injunction prohibiting the Merger, (iv) the accuracy of each partys representations and warranties and (v) each partys compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Lexmark and Perceptive.  There is no termination fee, except to the extent the termination results from the knowing, willful and material breach by the non-terminating party, in which case the terminating party may pursue all legal remedies and would be entitled to the payment of its expenses associated with the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Merger Agreement and: (a) should not in all instances be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the Merger Agreement; (c) may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material to you or other investors; and (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Merger Agreement and are subject to more recent developments. Accordingly, these representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs as of the date they were made or at any other time.
Item 8.01.                      Other Events.
On May 21, 2010, Lexmark and Perceptive issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.  The text of the press release announcing the Merger is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(a)           From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Seller pursuant to any agreement of the Seller providing for the indemnification of its officers or directors (the current and former officers and directors of the Seller, and all other persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such agreements being referred to collectively as the Seller Indemnified Parties). From and after the Effective Time, except to the extent otherwise required to comply with applicable law, Buyer shall cause the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with respect to exculpation from liability no less favorable to the beneficiaries thereof than those set forth in the Sellers certificate of incorporation immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date) or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Seller Indemnified Party delivers to Buyer a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.6(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.  In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Buyer will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, Buyer will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Seller Indemnified Parties entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) any counsel retained by the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense thereof for any period after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and (iii) after the Effective Time, Buyer will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided that in the event of a final non-appealable judicial determination that any Seller Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, any amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving Corporation); , that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation, nor any Seller Indemnified Party, will be liable for any settlement effected without its, his or her express written consent.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 5.6 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Seller Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(c)           From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit of the Seller Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of directors and officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Sellers current directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
 
(d)           This Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Seller Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation.
 
5.7           .  Buyer and certain employees of Seller are entering into certain employment and other related agreements concurrently with this Agreement, which agreements shall be held in escrow by Buyer until the Closing Date, at which time they will be released and become effective.

SURVIVAL AND
INDEMNIFICATION
 
           8.1           .
Survival
 
(a)           All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Seller in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the supplements to the Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Merger until the Escrow Termination Date, except that the representations and warranties in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.10, 2.16, 3.1 and 3.2 (the Specified Representations) shall survive until thirty (30) days beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and no claims for breach of representations, warranties, covenants and obligations may be brought after the Escrow Termination Date, or with respect to the Specified Representations, thirty (30) days beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.  It is the express intent of the parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item as contemplated by this Section 8.1 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby.  The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 8.1 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.
 
(b)           The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation or assessment) conducted with respect to or any knowledge acquired at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy, inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.  The waiver of any condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.
 
8.2           .
Indemnification
 
(a)           After the Closing Date, the Stockholders thereafter shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation and each of its respective agents, representatives, employees, officers, directors, stockholders, controlling persons and affiliates (collectively, the Buyer Indemnitees), and shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any loss, liability, claim, damage, expense (including, but not limited to, costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys fees), whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively, Damages) actually paid or suffered as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Seller in Article II of this Agreement or the Seller Closing Certificate, and (ii) any failure of Seller to perform or comply with any agreement to be performed or complied with by it in this Agreement.  Each Stockholder shall be severally, and not jointly, liable on a pro rata basis for its respective indemnification obligations under this
 
 
39 
 
Section 8.2(a), which shall be determined based on the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate consideration payable to such Stockholder pursuant to by the aggregate Closing Date Cash Consideration (the Pro Rata Portion).
Section 1.7
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.2 until the aggregate amount of all Damages under this Section 8.2 incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees (collectively) exceeds $1,250,000 (the Seller Threshold); provided, however, that all claims of Buyer Indemnitees under Section 8.2 shall accrue in the aggregate until the Damages of Buyer Indemnitees exceed the Seller Threshold, and thereupon the Buyer Indemnitees shall become entitled to be to indemnified for only such Damages that exceed $500,000.
 
(c)           Subject to the following sentence, but notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, recourse to the Escrow Fund shall be the Buyer Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing for claims pursuant to Article VIII.  After the funds in the Escrow Fund have been exhausted, the Buyer Indemnitees may seek recourse directly from the Stockholders for claims for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i) for Damages resulting from a failure of the Specified Representations to be true, that the maximum amount the Buyer Indemnitees may recover directly from any Stockholder for all such claims shall be limited in the aggregate to the portion of the proceeds actually received by such Stockholder  pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that any amounts held on behalf of a Stockholder in the Escrow Fund shall not be deemed to have been actually received for purposes of this Section 8.2(c) unless and until such amounts have been actually distributed to such Stockholder). Except as otherwise provided herein, no current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Seller shall have any personal or individual liability of any nature to the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set forth in, or any other breach of, this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Buyer from bringing a common law action for actual fraud with intent to deceive against any Person whose own such fraud has caused Buyer to incur Damages or limit the Damages recoverable by Buyer in such common law action, provided that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover more than once for the same Damages.
provided
 
(d)           Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Article VIII, for purposes of this Agreement, none of the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to be or to have been inaccurate if, during the period from the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, (i) the Seller delivers written notice of the inaccuracy to Buyer or MergerCo and (ii) Buyer and MergerCo nonetheless elect to proceed with the Closing.
 
(e)           The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification under this Article VIII shall be calculated net of: (i) any tax benefit received or receivable by the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with such Damages or any of the events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages; and (ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements received or receivable by the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with such Damages or any of the events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages.  The Buyer Indemnitees shall seek full
 
 
40 
 
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Damages to the same extent as they would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder.
 
(f)           To the extent the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, the Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the Buyer Indemnitees may have against any other Person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such indemnification payment is directly or indirectly related.  The Buyer Indemnitees shall permit the Stockholders Agent to use the name of any of the Buyer Indemnitees in any transaction or in any action or proceeding or other matter involving any of such rights or remedies, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall take such actions as the Stockholders Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Stockholders Agent to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the Stockholders Agent hereunder.
 
(g)           Promptly after any of the Buyer Indemnitees becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or give rise to any indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnitee under this Article VIII, such Buyer Indemnitee shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and minimize all Damages that may result from such event or circumstance.
 
8.3           .
Indemnification Payment
 
(a)           Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.3 unless it has duly delivered a written notice to the Stockholders Agent and the Escrow Agent (any such notice being referred to as a Notice of Indemnification Claim, and the claim for indemnification described in such Notice of Indemnification Claim being referred to as an indemnification claim), setting forth: (i) the specific representation and warranty alleged to have been breached by the Company; (ii) a detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach of such representation and warranty; and (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Damages being claimed with respect to the breach referred to in such notice (the aggregate amount of such estimate being referred to as the Claimed Amount).
 
(b)           During the 45-day period commencing upon the receipt by the Stockholders Agent of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Stockholders Agent shall deliver to Buyer and the Escrow Agent a written response (the Response Notice) in which the Stockholders Agent:  (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer; (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount (the Agreed Amount) is owed to Buyer; or (iii) asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer.  Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the Stockholders Agent to be owed to Buyer pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Stockholders Agent asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer) shall be referred to as the Contested Amount.  If the Stockholders Agent does not deliver a Response Notice within the aforementioned 45-day period, it shall be deemed to have submitted a Response Notice in which the Agreed Amount was equal to the Claimed Amount.
 
 
41
 
 
(c)           If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three days following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, Buyer and the Stockholders Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full Claimed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the Escrow Fund.
 
(d)           If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three days following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, Buyer and the Stockholders Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the Escrow Fund.
 
(e)           If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders Agent and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount.  If Buyer and the Stockholders Agent resolve such dispute in writing, then a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to Buyer (the Stipulated Amount) shall be signed by Buyer and the Stockholders Agent. Within three days after the execution of such settlement agreement, Buyer and the Stockholders Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Stipulated Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the Escrow Fund.
 
(f)           If the Stockholders Agent and Buyer are unable to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt of the Response Notice by Buyer, then either Buyer or the Stockholders Agent may submit the contested portion of the indemnification claim to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 8.3. The final decision of the arbitrator shall include the dollar amount of the award to Buyer, if any (the Award Amount), and shall be furnished to the Stockholders Agent and Buyer in writing.  Within three days following the receipt of the final award of the arbitrator setting forth the Award Amount, Buyer and the Stockholders Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Award Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the Escrow Fund.
 
(g)           If the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the Escrow Termination Date (the Aggregate Escrow Balance) exceeds the aggregate dollar amount, as of the Escrow Termination Date, of (i) the Contested Amounts associated with all indemnification claims that have not been finally resolved and paid prior to the Termination Date in accordance with this Section 8.3, and (ii) any Claimed Amounts for which Stockholders Agent has not yet delivered a Response Notice (each, an Unresolved Escrow Claim, and the aggregate dollar amount of such Contested Amounts as of the Escrow Termination Date being referred to as the Aggregate Pending Claim Amount), then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Fund, either (x) the Aggregate Distribution Amount to the Paying Agent, or (y) to each Participant, an amount determined by such Participants Pro Rata Portion the Aggregate Distribution Amount, as shall be determined by Buyer and Stockholders Agent.

(h)           Following the Escrow Termination Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is finally resolved, Buyer and the Stockholders Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund, either (i) the Excess Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent, or (ii) to each Participant an amount determined by such Participants Pro Rata Portion the Excess Escrow Amount, as shall be determined by Buyer and Stockholders Agent.  For purposes of this Section 8.3(h), the Excess Escrow Amount shall mean the amount (if any) by which the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the date of resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the Contested Amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims.

(i)           The parties agree that any amounts released to Buyer from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate consideration paid in connection with the Merger for all income tax purposes.
 
8.4           .  The Buyer shall with reasonable promptness give to the Stockholders Agent written notice if it or any of the other Buyer Indemnitees becomes aware of any liability, loss, damage, claim, cost and expense with respect to which indemnity under Section 8.2 may be asserted.  If any claim is made by a third person or an action or proceeding commenced for which the any of the Buyer Indemnitees shall seek indemnity from the Stockholders, Buyer party shall give to the Stockholders Agent prompt written notice of the claim stating the nature and basis of such claim and, to the extent known, the amount of and remedy sought by such third person, and request the Stockholders Agent, on behalf of the Stockholders, to defend the same; provided, that the failure of the Buyer to deliver prompt written notice shall not result in any liability on the part of the Buyer (or result in the reduction of any right to indemnification) except to the extent of actual prejudice which results from such failure.  The Stockholders Agent shall have the right to defend against such liability at its expense, and shall give written notice to the Buyer of the commencement of such defense with reasonable promptness after the giving of the written notice of the claim by the Buyer.  The Buyer shall be entitled to participate with the Stockholders Agent in such defense (at the Buyers expense except with respect to defenses which are not available to the Stockholders Agent), but shall not be entitled in any way to release, waive, settle, modify or pay such claim without the written consent of the Stockholders Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if the Stockholders Agent has assumed such defense.  In the event the Stockholders Agent does not accept the defense of the matter as provided above, or does not notify the Buyer of its election to defend such a matter within 30 days after written notice from the Buyer, the Buyer shall have the full right to defend against such liability and consent to the entry of any judgment or settlement of the matter in such manner as it may deem appropriate.  In the event the Stockholders Agent shall assume the defense, the Buyer shall cooperate in the defense of such action, and the records of the Buyer shall be available to the Stockholders Agent with respect to such defense, provided, however, that the Stockholders Agent shall not, in the defense of any such action, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement where such entry of

Exhibit 99.1
 
Lexmark announces definitive agreement to acquire Perceptive Software
 
LEXINGTON, Ky., and SHAWNEE, Kan., May 21, 2010  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) and Perceptive Software () today announced a definitive agreement for Lexmark to acquire Perceptive Software in a cash transaction valued at approximately $280 million.
www.perceptivesoftware.com
Perceptive Software is a leading provider of ECM software and solutions, with significant industry experience in the higher education, healthcare and government segments. Perceptive Software is one of the fastest growing ECM providers in the market, and its ImageNow software platform enables a broad range of industry-specific and cross-industry workflow solutions. A key strength and differentiator of its ECM software platform is the ability to be quickly and easily configured, and integrated with a large number of ERP, CRM and line-of-business applications.
"Lexmark has been a leader in industry-focused, paper-based workflow solutions for more than 10 years," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmarks chairman and chief executive officer. "The acquisition of Perceptive Software builds upon and strengthens our current industry workflow solutions, and broadens the portfolio of offerings to our current customers including our managed print services customers.
Perceptive Software is headquartered in Shawnee, Kan., and generated about $84 million in fiscal year 2009 sales, principally in the U.S. Through the acquisition of Perceptive Software, Lexmark adds a complementary, fast growing software business that is aligned with its existing industry-focused value proposition. This acquisition enables Lexmark to immediately participate in the adjacent, growing market segment of ECM software solutions. It also provides additional, growing revenue streams in software maintenance and professional services that are not paper usage dependent.
We believe that the combination of our two companies will drive significant growth in Perceptive Softwares software business," said Scott Coons, Perceptive Software's
 
 
 
president and chief executive officer. "We look forward to accelerating our growth within Lexmark, benefiting from Lexmarks global footprint and broad reach with enterprise customers."
 
This added software platform provides a core component of Lexmarks strategy to deliver industry-focused document workflow solutions, software and services that lower our customers costs and significantly improve their productivity, Curlander added.
Lexmark expects the transaction to be accretive to 2011 non-GAAP earnings. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2010.
Upon closing, Perceptive Software will retain its current name and operate as a stand-alone software business within Lexmark. Coons will become a Lexmark vice president and will continue as Perceptive Softwares president and chief executive officer, reporting to Curlander. The acquisition of Perceptive Software is subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

On July 22, 2010, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of the Board that the size of the Board be increased from nine to eleven directors and that Dr. Jared L.

There are no transactions involving the Company and Dr. Cohon that the Company would be required to be report pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Concurrent with his election as a director, Mr. Coleman was appointed to the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Coleman and any other person pursuant to which he was selected as a director. There are no transactions involving the Company and Mr. Coleman that the Company would be required to be report pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

In accordance with the Companys customary practice, the Company is entering into an indemnification agreement with each of Dr. Cohon and Mr. Coleman, which requires the Company to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise as a result of their status or service as directors.  The indemnification protection commences on the date of the agreement and continues through the later of ten years after the directors termination of service or the final termination of any Proceeding, as defined in the Agreement, then pending in which the director is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of expenses or any Proceeding commenced by the director seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses.

Exhibit 10.1
This Indemnification Agreement, made and entered into as of the <<Effective_Date>> ("Agreement"), by and among Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and <<Name>> ("Indemnitee"):
WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve corporations as directors, officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities.  Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions.  At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself;
WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;
WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the By-Laws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefore, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder;
WHEREAS, the Company's By-Laws and the Delaware corporate indemnification statute (145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) each is
Form of Indemnification Agreement (Director)

nonexclusive and, therefore, contemplates that contracts may be entered into with respect to indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents;
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; and
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
Section 1.  .  Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director, officer, employee and/or agent of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and may serve, at the request of the Company, as a director, officer, employee and/or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (a "Relevant Enterprise").  Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position.  This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and Indemnitee.  Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that Indemnitee's employment with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries), if any, is "at will", and the Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided in any written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries), other applicable formal severance policies duly adopted by the Board, or, with respect to service as a director of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries, by the relevant company's Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director, officer, employee and/or agent, as the case may be, of the Company and its subsidiaries or of a Relevant Enterprise.
Services by Indemnitee
Section 2.  .  The Company shall indemnify and advance Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to Indemnitee (a) as provided in this Agreement and (b) (subject to the provisions of this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and as amended from time to time.  The rights of Indemnitee provided under the preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the rights set forth in the other Sections of this Agreement.

Section 3.  .  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 3 if, by reason of his Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a  participant in any threatened, pending, or completed Proceeding (as hereinafter defined), other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries.  Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
Section 4.  .  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 4 if, by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries to procure a judgment in its favor.  Pursuant to this Section, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries; , , that, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries unless and to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall determine that such indemnification may be made.
Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
provided

Section 5.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in defense of such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.  For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and

amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion to which Indemnitee is entitled.
Section 6.  .
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
(a)           The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within seven (7) business days of such request) advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or By-Law of the Company now or hereafter in effect; or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.
Section 7.  .  The Company shall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within seven (7) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the Company to advance Expenses pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Company determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed, within thirty (30) days of such determination, by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid; , , that if Indemnitee has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Company that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advance of Expenses until a

final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed).
Section 8.  .
Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
(a)           To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b)           Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 8(a) hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case:  (i) if a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change of Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum of the Board, or (B) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (C) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within seven (7) days after such determination.  Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification), and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
(c)           In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 8(c).  If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the
Form of Indemnification Agreement (Director)

Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 17 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee, as the case may be, may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 8(b) hereof.  The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Section 8(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.  Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 10(a)(iii) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
provided
however
(d)           The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of the Indemnitee to the settlement of any Proceeding which the Company has undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement and the settlement grants the Indemnitee a complete and unqualified release in respect of the potential liability.  The Company shall not be liable for any amount paid by the Indemnitee in settlement of any Proceeding that is not defended by the Company, unless the Company has consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 9.  .
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
(a)           In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification or the advancement of expenses hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification or the advancement of expenses in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to

overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.  Neither the failure of the Company (including its board of directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its board of directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(b)           If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 8 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; , , that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 9(b) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination, the Board of Directors has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement.
provided
however
(c)           The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

or books of account of the Company or relevant subsidiary or Relevant Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Company or relevant subsidiary or Relevant Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or relevant subsidiary or Relevant Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or relevant subsidiary or Relevant Enterprise.  The provisions of this Section 9(d) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
(e)           The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Relevant Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
Section 10.  .
Remedies of Indemnitee

Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 10(a); , , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.

(b)           In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 10 shall be conducted in all respects as a trial, or arbitration, on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.  If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 10, the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.

"Lexmark's second quarter results were significantly better than expected, driven by double-digit growth in both hardware and supplies revenue, as well as operating income margin expansion," said Paul J. Curlander, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.
"This strong performance is a reflection of our improved product lines, continued growth in managed print services, the shift in our inkjet focus to business customers, and our ongoing strong growth in workgroup lasers and higher end inkjet products
," Curlander added.
Second quarter Printing Solutions and Services Division (PSSD) revenue of $752 million grew 20 percent year to year, Imaging Solutions Division (ISD) revenue of $275 million declined 2 percent year to year, and all other GAAP revenue was $6 million, or $8 million excluding acquisition-related adjustments.

Through the acquisition of Perceptive Software, Lexmark adds a complementary software business that is aligned with its existing industry-focused value proposition.

Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Appointment of Certain Officers and Director
On October 21, 2010, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) appointed Paul A. Rooke, age 52, as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to succeed Paul J. Curlander and appointed Dr. Curlander, age 57, to serve in the newly created position of Executive Chairman, effective on October 26, 2010 (the Effective Date).
The Board also approved the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of the Board that on the Effective Date the size of the Board be increased from eleven to twelve directors; that Mr. Rooke be elected to the Board as a Class II Director with a term expiring at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and, that Mr. Rooke be appointed to serve on the Executive Committee of the Board.  Mr. Rooke will not receive any compensation for his service as a director.  There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Rooke and any other person pursuant to which he was selected as a director.
Dr. Curlander will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.  Dr. Curlander plans on retiring from the Board and as Executive Chairman of the Company, effective April 30, 2011.  As the Executive Chairman, Dr. Curlander will remain an officer for purposes of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and therefore subject to the filing requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
These management changes are the result of a planned management succession process.
Mr. Rooke has been with the Company since its formation and has served as the executive vice president and president of the Companys Imaging Solutions Division since July 2007.  From 2002 to July 2007, Mr. Rooke served as executive vice president and president of the Companys Printing Solutions and Services Division.
Dr. Curlander has been with the Company since its formation and for over the last twelve years he served as the Companys Chief Executive Officer.
There are no transactions involving the Company and Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander that the Company would be required to be report pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  There are no family relationships between Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander with any other executive officers of the Company or members of the Board.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
In connection with the appointment of Mr. Rooke to his position as President and Chief Executive Officer, the Board approved the recommendation of the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board to increase Mr. Rookes annual base salary from $570,000 to $800,000, as of the Effective Date.  Subject to the maximum award amount of six-tenths of one percent of
 
 
 
 
operating income as set forth in the Companys Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan as approved by the Stockholders of the Company, Mr. Rookes maximum annual incentive compensation opportunity (expressed as a percentage of his annual base salary) was increased from 175% to 200% as of the Effective Date.  His minimum annual incentive compensation opportunity of 30% of his annual base salary and his target annual incentive compensation of 100% of his annual base salary were not changed.
The Board has also granted Mr. Rooke a long-term incentive award comprised of 22,000 restricted stock units and 60,000 stock options, as of the Effective Date and pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan as approved by the Stockholders of the Company.  The restricted stock units will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on the second through fourth anniversaries of the Effective Date.  The stock options, with an exercise price of $37.71, the closing price of the stock on October 26, 2010, shall become vested and exercisable in four equal installments (25% per year) on each of the 1 through 4 anniversaries of the Effective Date.  The stock options shall expire on October 26, 2020, if not sooner forfeited or exercised.  The restricted stock unit and stock option awards are subject to Mr. Rookes continued employment with the Company from the Effective Date until the relevant vesting date.
st
th
Other than as indicated herein, the compensation arrangements for Mr. Rooke and Dr. Curlander remain the same.
On the Effective Date, the Company entered into a new form of Employment Agreement and a new form of Change in Control Agreement (CIC Agreement) with each of Dr. Curlander and Mr. Rooke.
The new form of Employment Agreement was prepared to replace their employment agreements which were scheduled to expire on October 31, 2010. The Employment Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on October 31, 2012 for Mr. Rooke and April 30, 2011 for Dr. Curlander.  In each case, the executive officers employment shall continue thereafter at will. The Employment Agreement provides for certain additional payments beyond the term of employment if the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the executive officer for good reason, or as a result of the executive officers death or disability. These potential payments are substantially the same as provided in the p redecessor agreements they replace. The new form of Employment Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
In the interest of complying with best pay practices, the Company and each of Dr. Curlander and Mr. Rooke agreed to a new form of CIC Agreement that eliminates the excise tax gross up provisions set forth in their predecessor agreements.  Under the predecessor agreements, if any excise tax was imposed because payments under the agreement resulted in excess parachute payments, the executive officer would receive a gross-up payment that would result in the payment of any such taxes and any additional excise taxes imposed on the gross-up payment.  For Mr. Rooke, the new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on October 26, 2012, provided however, that commencing on October 26, 2011 and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC
 
 
 
 
Agreement shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date.  For Dr. Curlander, the new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on April 30, 2011, provided, however, that commencing on March 31, 2011, and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC Agreement shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date. The CIC Agreement also provides that if the executive voluntarily terminates employment the CIC Agreement will terminate without any further obligations to executive other than for certain accrued obligations. The CIC Agreement generally provides for certain payments to each executive officer if, within 12 months prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreemen t), the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, or within 24 months after a Change in Control, the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company or by the executive officer under certain circumstances. In the event of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer would receive his base salary and pro rata annual bonus through the date of termination. In addition, the executive officer would receive three times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation. The CIC Agreement also provides for the continuation of welfare benefits for a period of three years. Under the new form of CIC Agreement, if any payments under the agreement trigger the excise tax, then the executive officers payments shall be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax if the net after - -tax benefit of such reduction exceeds the net after-tax benefit if such reduction is not made.  The new form of CIC Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and CIC Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of Employment Agreement for Executive Officers and form of CIC Agreement for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, and incorporated herein by reference.

Forfeiture of Realized and Unrealized Gains on Incentive Awards for Breach of this Agreement.

limited to stock options, restricted stock awards and any deferred stock units, held by the Employee shall terminate effective as of the date on which the Employee violates this Agreement, unless terminated sooner by operation of another term or condition of the Employees stock incentive award agreement or the plan pursuant to which such award has been issued, and (2) any gain realized by the Employee on the vesting of restricted stock or deferred stock units, and option gains (represented by the closing market price on the date of exercise over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of options exercised without regard to any subsequent market price decrease or increase) realized by the Employee from exercising all or a portion of the Employees options, within 18 months preceding the earlier of (a) the violation of Section 7, 8, 9, or 10 and (b) the Employees Date of Termination; and through the later of (c) 18 months following the violation of Section 7, 8, 9, or 10 and (d) such period of time as it takes the Employer to discover such violation, shall be paid promptly by the Employee to the Employer.  The Employee agrees that the Employer has the right to withhold the amount owed to it from any amounts that the Employer may owe the Employee from time to time (including, but not limited to, wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay); provided, however, if any amounts that the Employer is required to pay to the Employee are subject to Code Section 409A, any such withholding by the Employer from those amounts shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent applicable thereto.  The Employee and the Employer agree that this forfeiture provision does not waive any other rights at law that the Employer may have, including but not limited to, equitable rights which would includ e injunctive relief.
(b)           .  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that he is subject to the terms and conditions of the Employers Executive Compensation Recovery Policy (including any successor policy that may be adopted by the Employer to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Rules promulgated thereunder), and that all or any portion of the Employees Annual Bonus, other incentive compensation, and equity compensation may be subject to forfeiture and previously paid amounts may be subject to recovery by the Employer in accordance with the Executive Compensation Recovery Policy.
Forfeiture under the Employers Executive Compensation Recovery Policy
12.           .  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement (as well as each subsection of such Sections) shall be construed as agreements independent of each other and of any provision of this or any other contract between the parties hereto, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by the Employee against the Employer, whether predicated upon this or any other contract, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of said covenants.  The Employee further agrees that the term of the covenants cont ained in Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement (as well as each subsection of such Sections) and the geographic limitations are reasonable limits within the context of the Employees current or former activities for the Employer.  The Employee therefore waives any defense to enforcement of these covenants on the grounds that these covenants are not valid or that the terms of these covenants are not reasonable, but the
Waiver of Defenses; Enforceability of Covenants
 
 
8
 
Employee expressly does not waive the right to seek a construction of the covenants themselves.  In the event that any provisions relating to these covenants shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time periods and/or areas of restriction deemed reasonable and enforceable, the time period and/or areas of restriction deemed reasonable and enforceable by such court shall become and thereafter be the maximum time period and/or areas.
13.           .  The Employee acknowledges that the Proprietary Information and the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement are extremely valuable to the Employer, and the Employee recognizes and agrees that the injury the Employer will suffer in the event of the Employees breach of this Agreement cannot be compensated by monetary damages alone, including pursuant to Section 11, and the Employee therefore agrees that the Employer, in addition to and without limiting any other remedies or rights that it may have, either under this Agreement or otherwise, shall have the right to obtain an injunction against the Employee (including but not limited to, a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction), without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement from a court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach.
Employers Right to Obtain an Injunction
14.           .  The Employer will require any successor (by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Employer, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Employer to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement entitling the Employee to receive severance pay under the CIC Agreement upon a termination of employment by Employee for Good Reason as defined in the CIC Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, "Employer" shall mean the Employer as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
Assumption of Agreement
15.           .  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement, the CIC Agreement and any Indemnification Agreement made and entered into by and between Employer and Employee or any Indemnification Agreement by and among Lexmark International Group, Inc. and/or the Employer and the Employee (the Indemnification Agreement) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all promises, representations, understandings, arrangements and prior agreements relating to such subject matter (including those made to or with the Employee by any other person or entity) are merged herein, in the CIC Agreement and in the Indemnification Agreement and superseded hereby and thereby.

The Executive further agrees that the term of the covenants contained in this Section 10 (as well as each sub-section) and the geographic limitations are reas onable limits within the context of the Executives current or former activities for the Company.  The Executive therefore waives any defense to enforcement of these covenants on the grounds that these covenants are not valid or that the terms of these covenants are not reasonable, but the Executive expressly does not waive the right to seek a construction of the covenants themselves.  In the event that any provisions relating to this covenant shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time periods and/or areas of restriction deemed reasonable and enforceable, the time period and/or areas of restriction deemed reasonable and enforceable by such court shall become and thereafter be the maximum time period and/or areas.
Waiver of Defenses; Enforceability of Covenants
(f)           .  The Executive acknowledges that the Proprietary Information and the covenants contained in this Section 10 are extremely valuable to the Company and Executive recognizes and agrees that the injury the Company will suffer in the event of the Executive's breach of this Agreement cannot be compensated by monetary damages alone, and the Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to and without limiting any other remedies or rights that it may have, either under this Agreement or otherwise, shall have the right to obtain an injunction against the Executive (including but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, or a preliminary or permanent injunction), without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement from a court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach.

On November 1, 2010, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) entered into a new form of Employment Agreement and a new form of Change in Control Agreement (CIC Agreement) with, among other executive officers, each of John W. Gamble, Jr., the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martin S. Canning, Executive Vice President and President of Imaging Solutions and Services, and Ronaldo M. Foresti, Vice President of Asia Pacific and Latin America, each a named executive officer of the Company.
The new form of Employment Agreement was prepared to replace each executive officers employment agreement that expired on October 31, 2010. The Employment Agreement provides for a term commencing on November 1, 2010 and ending on October 31, 2012. In each case, the executive officers employment shall continue thereafter at will. The Employment Agreement provides for certain additional payments beyond the term of employment if the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the executive officer for good reason, or as a result of the executive officers death or disability. These potential payments are substantially the same as provided in the predecessor agreements they replace. The new form of Employment Agreement otherwise includes covenants and c onditions typically included in such agreements.
In the interest of complying with best pay practices, the Company and each of the executive officers agreed to a new form of CIC Agreement that eliminates the excise tax gross up provisions set forth in the predecessor agreements.  Under the predecessor agreements, if any excise tax was imposed because payments under the agreement resulted in excess parachute payments, the executive officer would receive a gross-up payment that would result in the payment of any such taxes and any additional excise taxes imposed on the gross-up payment.  The new form of CIC Agreement provides for a term commencing on November 1, 2010 and ending on October 31, 2012, provided however, that commencing on November 1, 2011 and on each anniversary thereof, unless previously terminated, the CIC Agreement shall be automaticall y extended so as to terminate two years from such renewal date.  The CIC Agreement generally provides for certain payments to each of the executive officers if, within 12 months prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreement), the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, or within 24 months after a Change in Control, the executive officers employment is terminated by the Company or by the executive officer under certain circumstances. In the event of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer would receive his base salary and pro rata annual bonus through the date of termination. In addition, in the case of Messrs. Gamble and Canning, the executive officer would receive three times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation, and in the case of Mr. Foresti, two times the sum of his annual base salary and annual incentive compensation. The CIC Agreement also provides for the continuation of welfare benefits for a period of three years in the case of Messrs. Gamble and Canning, and for a period of two years in the case of Mr. Foresti. Under the new form of CIC Agreement, if any payments under the agreement trigger the excise tax, then the executive
 
 
 
 
officers payments shall be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax if the net after-tax benefit of such reduction exceeds the net after-tax benefit if such reduction is not made.  The new form of CIC Agreement otherwise includes covenants and conditions typically included in such agreements.
The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and CIC Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of Employment Agreement for Executive Officers, the form of CIC Agreement for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents, and the form of CIC Agreement for Vice Presidents, which are filed hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01.  Other Events
On November 5, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing that it is combining its two printing organizations, the Printing Solutions and Services Division (PS&SD) and the Imaging Solutions Division (ISD), into a single organization named Imaging Solutions and Services (ISS).  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

2011 Incentive Compensation Award Opportunities for Named Executive Officers
On February 23, 2011, the Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee) granted annual incentive compensation award opportunities with respect to the 2011 calendar year (the IC Performance Period) to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Senior Executive IC Plan). The maximum award which may be earned under the Senior Executive IC Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of operating income for the IC Performance Period. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a Named Executive Officer based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives established under the Companys 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan (2011 IC Plan).
Under the 2011 IC Plan, the Compensation Committee has established a Threshold Plan and a Traditional Plan, and the award amount is based on the greater of the Threshold Plan or Traditional Plan, subject to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan.  Under the Traditional Plan, performance measures include revenue, operating income, cash cycle days, business unit revenue, business unit operating income and individual performance, each excluding acquisition activity.  Under the Threshold Plan, performance measures include worldwide free cash flow and individual performance, excluding acquisition activity and pension contributions.  The minimum award opportunity established under the Threshold Plan and the minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the Traditional Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers, other than Dr. Curlander, who is retiring on April 30, 2011, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan, are set forth in the following table.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Opportunities for the Named Executive Officers
Also on February 23, 2011, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Dr. Curlander and Mr. Rooke, a long-term incentive opportunity comprised 70% of performance-based restricted stock units and 30% of time-based restricted stock units. No long-term incentive opportunity was awarded to Dr. Curlander due to his pending retirement.
 
 
 
 
Mr. Rookes long-term incentive opportunity is comprised 100% of performance-based restricted stock units.
The performance measure for the performance-based restricted stock units is worldwide free cash flow, excluding all acquisition activity and pension contributions. The performance period is January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 (the RSU Performance Period). The performance-based restricted stock units to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2012, with vesting and settlement of any earned performance-based restricted stock units to occur in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2012, February 24, 2014 and February 24, 2015, based on the Named Executive Officers continued employment on each vesting date. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the RSU Performance Period to earn the performance-based restricted stock units.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason will result in forfeiture of the award.  The vesting of any earned performance-based restricted stock units after the end of the RSU Performance Period will be accelerated in the event of the Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement occurring after the completion of the RSU Performance Period.
The time-based restricted stock unit awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2013, February 24, 2014 and February 24, 2015, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date. The time-based restricted stock units awarded, as well as the minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based restricted stock unit awards are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2010 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2011.

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $366 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on July 28, 2011, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement) with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $125 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Citibank.  The ASR Agreement requires Citibank to deliver to the Company on August 2, 2011, 3,134,219 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $33.90, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on July 28, 2011.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Citibank under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Citibank, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Citibank as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the second half of 2011.  The payment of $125 million by the Company to Citibank for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available U.S. cash.
The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ASR Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and which is incorporated herein by reference.

The foregoing description of the amendment to the By-Laws does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment and Restatement of the By-Laws, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and which is incorporated herein by reference.

Section 6.06.  .  The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Director, officer, employee and agent who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the Delaware Corporation Law are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.  Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such Director, officer, employee or agent.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Lexmark acquires Pallas Athena
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 18, 2011 Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced the acquisition of Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction, valued at approximately $50.2 million. Upon completion of the transaction, the Dutch company will become a part of Perceptive Software, a stand-alone business unit within Lexmark.
 
Pallas Athenas chairman and chief executive officer, John Hoogland, will report directly to Scott Coons, Perceptive Softwares president and chief executive officer and Lexmark vice president.
Pallas Athena is a leading provider of BPM, DOM and process mining software, with significant industry experience in the insurance, government and life sciences segments. Pallas Athenas software products enable a broad range of BPM capabilities, which includes dynamic case management and customer communications management. Key differentiators of its software products include ease of implementation and an intuitive user interface.
The rapidly growing BPM software market is closely adjacent to Perceptive Softwares existing enterprise content management (ECM) market. By bringing these closely aligned technologies together, Lexmark will further strengthen its industry-leading fleet management solutions and services with a broader range of workflow solutions that are more functional, and easier to implement and use than existing tools available in the market today.
Lexmarks acquisition of Pallas Athena will enable Perceptive Software to expand its EMEA region presence, while concurrently leveraging the companys growing worldwide sales force to sell these software solutions globally.

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $241 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on October 27, 2011, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with J.P. Morgan (the ASR Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $125 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from J.P. Morgan.  The ASR Agreement requires J.P. Morgan to deliver to the Company on November 1, 2011, 3,380,528 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $31.43, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on October 27, 2011.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by J.P. Morgan under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by J.P. Morgan, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to J.P. Morgan as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the quarter ending December 31, 2011.  The payment of $125 million by the Company to J.P. Morgan for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available U.S. cash equivalents and current marketable securities.
The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ASR Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1.01.                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a $350 million 5-year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on and effective as of January 18, 2012 (the "Effective Date") by and among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and SunTrust Bank and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as Co-Documentation Agents, and each other institutional lender signatory thereto.
The Credit Agreement provides for a 5-year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility that includes the availability of swingline loans and multicurrency letters of credit. Under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $500 million. Interest on all borrowings under the Credit Agreement is determined based upon either the Adjusted Base Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case plus a margin that is adjusted on the basis of a combination of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio and the Companys index debt rating.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including those relating to (a) a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA/consolidated interest expense) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and (b) a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness/consolidated EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement limits, among other things, the Company's indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business.
The Credit Agreement includes usual and customary events of default (subject, in most cases, to applicable grace periods) for facilities of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments shall automatically terminate.
As of the Effective Date, there are no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's current $300 million 3-year Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into on August 17, 2009, by the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent, Citibank, N.A. and SunTrust Bank as Co-Documentation Agents and each other institutional lender signatory thereto (the "Terminated Credit Agreement"), which agreement was terminated on and effective as of the Effective Date of the Credit Agreement. The Terminated Credit Agreement allowed for swingline loans and the issuance of multicurrency letters of credit under the credit facility. Interest on all borrowings was determined based upon several alternative rates, including a rate based on LIBOR. The Terminated Credit Agreement contained certain financial
 
 
 
covenants, including those relating to the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.

Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  If the Borrowers reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.

Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure  representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations.

refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7 Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agents Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the ) no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.

If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
   
   
  
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in
37 
 
 
 
LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
 
(e)
 
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.19.
 
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future
 
38 
 
 
and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)
 
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such  assignment and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.20.
 
Increase of Commitments

Such request shall be made in a written notice given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower not less than one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed effective date of such increase, which notice (a ) shall specify the amount of the proposed increase in the Aggregate Commitment and the proposed effective date of such increase.  The Borrower may notify the Administrative Agent of any financial institution that shall have agreed to become a Lender party hereto (a ) in connection with the Commitment Increase Notice and any Proposed New Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders on or before the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed effective date of the amount of each Lenders and Proposed New Lenders Commitment (the ) and the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, which amount shall be effective on the following Business Day.

The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
specified currency

ARTICLE VIII
 
The Administrative Agent
 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
55 
 
 
 
 the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required in the event a Default or Event of Default
56 
 
 
has occurred and is continuing.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.
 
The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in the case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Waivers; Amendments
. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
 
(b)  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase  the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
provided
 
(ii)           A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender).  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the ); that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

Lexmark v. Static Control Components, Inc. & Lexmark v. Clarity Imaging Technologies, Inc.
On December 30, 2002 (02 action) and March 16, 2004 (04 action), the Company filed claims against Static Control Components, Inc. (SCC) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (the District Court) alleging violation of the Companys intellectual property and state law rights. Similar claims in a separate action were filed by the Company in the District Court against Clarity Imaging Technologies, Inc. (Clarity) on October 8, 2004. SCC and Clarity have filed counterclaims against the Company in the District Court alleging that the Company engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws. SCC has stated in its legal documents that it is seeking approximately $17.8 million to $19.5 million in damages for the Companys alleged anticompetitive conduct and approximately $1 billion for Lexmarks alleged violation of the Lanham Act. Clarity has not stated a damage dollar amount. SCC and Clarity are seeking treble damages, attorney fees, costs and injunctive relief.  On September 28, 2006, the District Court dismissed the counterclaims filed by SCC that alleged the Company engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws. On October 13, 2006, SCC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the District Courts Order dismissing SCCs claims, or in the alternative, to amend its pleadings, which the District Court denied on June 1, 2007. On June 20, 2007, the District Court Judge ruled that SCC directly infringed one of Lexmarks patents-in-suit. On June 22, 2007, the jury returned a verdict that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmarks patents-in-suit. SCC has filed motions with the District Court seeking attorneys fees, cost and damages for the period that a preliminary injunction was in place that prevented SCC from selling certain microchips for some models of the Companys toner cartridges.  The Company has responded to these motions and they are pending with the District Court. Appeal briefs for the 02 and 04 actions have been filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
Copyright fees
Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and/or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have taken action to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content. Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices. The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country. The Company has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the risks related to the copyright fee issues currently pending. The financial impact on the Company, which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes, the Companys and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and the Companys ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon competitive market
 
 
 
conditions, remains uncertain. As of September 30, 2011, the Company has accrued a total of approximately $64.8 million for pending copyright fee charges, including litigation proceedings, local legislative initiatives and/or negotiations with the parties involved. Although it is reasonably possible that amounts may exceed the amount accrued by the Company, such amount, or range of possible loss, given the complexities of the legal issues in these matters, cannot be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time.
As of September 30, 2011, approximately $53.4 million of the $64.8 million accrued for the pending copyright fee issues was related to single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007. The VerwertungsGesellschaft Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection society representing certain copyright holders, instituted legal proceedings against Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") in July of 2004 relating to whether and to what extent copyright levies for photocopiers should be imposed in accordance with copyright laws implemented in Germany on single function printers.  The Company is not a party to this lawsuit, although the Company and VG Wort entered into an agreement in October 2002 pursuant to which both VG Wort and the Company agreed to be bound by the outcome of the VG Wort/HP litigation.  On December 6, 2007, the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal Supreme Court) in the VG Wort litigation with HP issued a judgment that single function printer devices sold in Germany prior to December 31, 2007 are not subject to levies under the then existing law (German Federal Supreme Court, file reference I ZR 94/05).  VG Wort filed an appeal with the Bundesverfassungsgericht (the German Federal Constitutional Court) challenging the ruling that single function printers are not subject to levies.  On September 21, 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court published a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court erred by not considering referring questions on interpretation of German copyright law to the Court of Justice of the European Communities and therefore revoked the German Federal Supreme Court decision and remitted the matter to it.  On July 21, 2011, the German Federal Supreme Court has stayed the proceedings and has submitted several questions regarding the interpretation of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society to the European Court of Justice for a decision.
On or about December 15, 2009, VG Wort instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against the Company before the arbitration board of the Patent and Trademark Office in Munich relating to whether and to what extent copyright levies should be imposed on single function printers sold by the Company in Germany from 2001 to 2007. In its submissions to the Patent and Trademark Office in Munich the Company asserted that all claims for levies on single function printers sold by the Company in Germany should be dismissed.  On February 22, 2011 the arbitration board issued a partial decision finding that the claims of VG Wort for the years 2001 through 2005 are time barred by the statute of limitations.  On October 27, 2011, the arbitration board further found that the copyright levy claims for single function printers for the years 2006 and 2007 should be dismissed pursuant to the October 2002 agreement between the Company and VG Wort finding the parties agreed to be bound by the judgment of the German Federal Supreme Court of December 6, 2007 which dismissed VG Worts copyright levy claims for single function printers.  VG Wort has filed objections against these non-binding decisions and further proceedings in German civil court on these issues are expected.

Credit Agreement
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the extensions of credit by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement that each of the Guarantors (constituting all of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower required to execute this Guaranty pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement) execute and deliver this Guaranty, whereby each of the Guarantors shall guarantee the payment when due of all Obligations; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of the direct and indirect financial and other support that the Borrower has provided, and such direct and indirect financial and other support as the Borrower may in the future provide, to the Guarantors, and in order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into the Credit Agreement, each of the Guarantors is willing to guarantee the Obligations of the Borrower;

(L)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent, any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this Section 4, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Guarantors obligations hereunder except as provided in Section 5.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be due and payable in the same currency as such Guaranteed Obligation is denominated, but if currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that such currency (the ) no longer exists or the relevant Guarantor is not able to make payment in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Guarantor hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of payment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that each Guarantor takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.

SECTION 7.  .
Subordination of Subrogation; Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness

(A)  Subordination of Subrogation.  Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the Guarantors (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) waive any right to enforce any remedy which the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent now have or may hereafter have against the Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, and (iii) waive any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent to secure the payment or performance of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other liability of the Borrower to the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations or the Issuing Bank.  Should any Guarantor have the right, notwithstanding the foregoing, to exercise its subrogation rights, each Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably (A) subordinates any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off that such Guarantor may have to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and (B) to the extent permitted by law, waives any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Guaranty, and that the Administrative Agent, the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this Section 7(A).
 
(B)  Subordination of Intercompany Indebtedness.  Each Guarantor agrees that any and all claims of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor hereunder (each an ) with respect to any Intercompany Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), any endorser, obligor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any of its properties shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Guaranteed Obligations; that, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may receive payments of principal and interest from any Obligor with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights, if any, of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied (in cash) and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document, any Swap Agreement or any Banking Services Agreement have been terminated.  If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an ), any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any indebtedness of any Obligor to any Guarantor () shall be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent for application on any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or to become due, until such Guaranteed Obligations shall have first been fully paid and satisfied (in cash).  Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by the

applicable Guarantor upon or with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior to the satisfaction of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall forthwith deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of the Guarantor where necessary), for application to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Guarantor as the property of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations.  If any such Guarantor fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same.  Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than the contingent indemnity obligations) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor.
SECTION 8.  .
Contribution with Respect to Guaranteed Obligations
(A)  To the extent that any Guarantor shall make a payment under this Guaranty (a ) which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Guarantor if each Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Guarantors Allocable Amount (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreements and the Banking Services Agreements, such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
Guarantor Payment
(B)  As of any date of determination, the Allocable Amount of any Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Guarantor that is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions.
(C)  This Section 8 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 8 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty.
(D)  The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Guarantor or Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.

Obligations in cash and the termination of the Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreements and the Banking Services Agreements.
SECTION 9.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law.  In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantors obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account.
Limitation of Guaranty
 
SECTION 10.  .  If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.

Notices
SECTION 12.  .  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any other Holder of Guaranteed Obligations in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

On January 31, 2012, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.

Item 2.05.                      Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
As part of the Companys ongoing plans to increase the focus of the Companys talent and resources on higher usage business platforms, the Company announced restructuring actions today.  This January 2012 plan includes reductions primarily in the areas of manufacturing, marketing, sales and other infrastructure.  The Company expects to redeploy a significant portion of the savings from these initiatives toward business products, solutions and channels.  The company expects these actions to be principally complete by the end of the first quarter of 2013.
These January 2012 actions are expected to impact about 625 positions worldwide and will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $35 million with approximately $8 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011.  The company expects the total cash cost of this plan to be approximately $24 million.
Lexmark expects these January 2012 actions to generate cash savings of approximately $15 million in 2012 and ongoing cash savings beginning in 2013 of approximately $28 million.  These ongoing savings should be split approximately 80% to operating expense and 20% to cost of goods sold.

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $211 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on January 31, 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with J.P. Morgan (the ASR Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $30 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from J.P. Morgan.  The ASR Agreement requires J.P. Morgan to deliver to the Company on February 3, 2012, 730,659 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $34.90, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on January 31, 2012.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by J.P. Morgan under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by J.P. Morgan, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to J.P. Morgan as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the quarter ending March 31, 2012.  The payment of $30 million by the Company to J.P. Morgan for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available U.S. cash equivalents and current marketable securities.
The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ASR Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and which is incorporated herein by reference.

2012 Incentive Compensation Award Opportunities for Named Executive Officers
On February 22, 2012, the Compensation and Pension Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) granted annual incentive compensation award opportunities with respect to the 2012 calendar year (the IC Performance Period) to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Senior Executive IC Plan). The maximum award which may be earned under the Senior Executive IC Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of Operating Income (as defined in the Senior Executive IC Plan) for the IC Performance Period. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a Named Executive Officer based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives established under the Companys 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (2012 IC Plan).
Under the 2012 IC Plan, the Compensation Committee has established a Traditional Plan and a Threshold Plan, and the award amount is based on the greater of the Traditional Plan or the Threshold Plan, subject to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan.  Under the Traditional Plan, corporate performance measures include core revenue, operating income, cash cycle days and individual performance.  Under the Traditional Plan, business or geographic unit performance measures include business unit or geographic unit core revenue, operating income, and cash cycle days.  Under the Threshold Plan, the performance measure is worldwide free cash flow.  Each of the performance measures include restructuring charges, but exclude acquisition related adjustment, and any 2012 acquisition activity.  The minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2012 IC Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan, are set forth in the following table.
 
 
 
2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Opportunities for the Named Executive Officers
Also on February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Rooke, a 2012-2014 long-term incentive award opportunity comprised as follows: a cash-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP) award representing 35% of the award opportunity; performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs) representing 35% of the award opportunity and time-based RSUs representing 30% of the award opportunity. Mr. Rookes 2012-2014 long-term incentive award opportunity, excludes time-based RSUs, and is comprised 50% of performance-based RSUs and 50% of a cash-based LTIP award.
The performance measure for the performance-based RSUs is the Companys relative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measured against the ROIC of companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the period commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2014 (the Performance Period). The performance-based RSUs to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2015, and if earned will be settled on February 24, 2015. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the Performance Period to earn the performance-based RSUs.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement ("disability" and "retirement," each as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) during the Performance Period, a prorated portion of the performance-based RSUs may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the performed period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate on February 24, 2015.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining whether performance-based RSUs shall be earned by a Named Executive Officer applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The time-based RSU awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2013, February 24, 2014 and February 24, 2015, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date. The time-based RSUs awarded, as well as the minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based RSU awards are set forth in the following table.
The cash-based long-term incentive award opportunities were granted pursuant to the 2012-2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2012-2014 LTIP").  The performance measure for the 2012
 
 
 
2014 LTIP is the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against the TSR of companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period.  Under the 2012-2014 LTIP, each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive a cash award at the end of the Performance Period based on the Companys TSR rank measured against the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index.  The Compensation Committee will make this determination in 2015, and if earned, the cash payout will occur prior to March 15, 2015.
The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the Performance Period to earn an LTIP payout.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement ("disability" and "retirement," each as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) during the Performance Period, a prorated portion of the award may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the Performance Period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate prior to March 15, 2015.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining any payout to an executive under the 2012-2014 LTIP applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2012-2014 LTIP for each of the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2011 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2012.

"Participant"
This Agreement is only a summary of the principal terms governing the LTIP.  The LTIP is subject in all respects to the terms of the Lexmark International, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the ). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.  It is important that the Participant read and understand the Plan and not rely solely on the brief description that follows.  All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Plan
Overview
The LTIP is designed to reward the achievement of a specific performance measure over a three-year period.  The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the ) established the Performance Measure, as defined below, for the performance period beginning January 1, 20XX and ending December 31, 20XX (the ).
Committee
Performance Period
Depending upon the Company's attainment of the Performance Measure, the Participant may be eligible to receive a payment under the LTIP, as set forth below.
Performance Measure
The Committee has established the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return () measured against the average TSR of the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index as the performance measure for the Performance Period (the ).  The calculation of TSR for the Company and for the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index, will reflect the appreciation (depreciation) in the average closing stock prices of the Company and the companies in the S&P 500 Technology Index for the 60-day period ending December 31, 20XX (the ) and the average closing stock prices for the 60-day period ending December 31, 20XX (the ), assuming that any dividends paid are reinvested on the date such amounts are paid to their respective shareholders.

Target Opportunity
The LTIP awards are denominated in cash, but in the Committees sole discretion may be paid in cash, the Companys Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and the Companys Class A Common Stock. For the Performance Period, your target award is [INSERT TARGET] ().
Target
The chart below illustrates how the LTIP awards will be calculated.
 
 
 
 
 
between the corresponding LTIP payment amounts, set forth above.  For example, if the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period is at the 45 percentile, the Participant shall be eligible to receive an LTIP payment equal to 75% of the Participants Target, subject to reduction in the Committees sole discretion.
th
Committee Discretion
The Committee may use its sole discretion in determining the amount of any payment, or no payment, to Participants under the LTIP and whether to reduce (but not increase) the amount of any payment based on any factors it deems appropriate.
Payout Timing
The Committee intends to review and approve the attainment of the Performance Measure following the end of the three-year Performance Period.  This review is expected to occur in a 20XX Committee meeting.  Payments will be made only after the Committee approval has occurred, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 20XX.
Separation from Service
Except in the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of the Participant during the Performance Period, the Participant must be employed at the end of the Performance Period (December 31, 20XX) to be eligible to receive a payout.  If the Participant should have a separation from service (as defined below) due to death, Disability or Retirement during the Performance Period, the payout, if any, is achieved based on the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P 500 Technology Index as of the end of the Performance Period, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the separation from service due to death Disability or Retirement divided by 36, and will be made only after Committee approval has occurred after the end of Performance Period, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 20XX.  For purposes of the LTIP, separation from service shall mean a separation from service from the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of Code Section 409A, using the default provisions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations, or any successor regulation thereto.
Change in Control
In the event of a Change in Control during the Performance Period, the Participant shall be entitled to a payout, as soon as practicable after the Change in Control, equal to the greater of Target or the actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P 500 Technology Index as of the date of the Change in Control, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control divided by 36.  If a Change in Control occurs after the Performance Period ends, but prior to the date of payment, the Participants payout, if any, shall be based on actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P 500 Technology Index for the Performance Period.
Forfeiture of the Award
The Participant acknowledges that this opportunity for a long-term incentive award has been granted as an incentive to the Participant to remain employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to exert his or her best efforts to enhance the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries over the long-term. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that if he or she (a) within 12 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, accepts employment with a competitor of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise engages in competition with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (b) within 36 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, disrupts, damages, interferes or otherwise acts against the interests of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, recruiting, soliciting or employing, or encouraging or assisting the Participant's new employer or any other person or entity to recruit, solicit or employ, any employee of

In this quarter, the company executed 
an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $30 million of the companys outstanding shares and announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share that will be paid on March 16, 2012, to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2012.

Our first quarter financial results were in line with guidance, reflecting growth in large workgroup hardware and core supplies, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.

Our performance in these high value strategic focus areas indicates we are making good progress as we continue to evolve our business mix.

Lexmark increases quarterly dividend by 20 percent
LEXINGTON, Ky.,April 26, 2012  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders that its board of directors has approved an increase of the quarterly dividend per shares of Lexmark Class A Common Stock by $0.05 per share to $0.30 per share (or $1.20 per share on an annual basis) from the previous $0.25 per share (or $1.00 per share on an annual basis).
 
Over the past few years, we have exited the consumer printing business, consolidated our operations and focused our resources squarely on the business customer, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. These actions have enabled Lexmark to focus on becoming a leading end-to-end solutions provider, and we believe our investments in managed print services, high usage hardware and high value software are bringing new and differentiated solutions to market and delivering long term value to our customers and shareholders.
Given our confidence in the strategy, our strong liquidity position and history of cash generation, we are confident in our continued ability to generate strong cash flow and execute our capital return framework while continuing strategic acquisitions. Therefore, I am pleased to announce a 20 percent increase in our dividend to Lexmark shareholders today, Rooke added.
The new quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on June 15, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2012. The new quarterly dividend equates to a yield of approximately 4 percent based on the companys stock price as of yesterdays close of trading.
The company also announced that each of the five directors up for election, and the advisory vote on executive compensation, were approved by shareholders by more than 93 percent of cast votes.
Future declarations of dividends are subject to board of director approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

Item 8.01.  Other Events.
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock (Common Stock), raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $186 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on April 26, 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), through its agent Barclays Capital Inc. (the ASR Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $25 million of the outstanding shares of its Common Stock from Barclays.  The ASR Agreement requires Barclays to deliver to the Company on May 1, 2012, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $30.17, the closing price of the Common Stock on April 26, 2012, less an agreed upon discount.  The final number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Barclays under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Barclays, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Barclays as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the quarter ending June 30, 2012.  The payment of $25 million by the Company to Barclays for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available U.S. cash equivalents and current marketable securities.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Lexmark revises financial outlook
LEXINGTON, Ky., July 12, 2012 Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced that second quarter 2012 financial results will be lower than expected.
 
Based on a preliminary analysis of second quarter financial results, the company currently expects second quarter revenue to decline about 12 percent year over year. This compares to the guidance that the company previously provided in April for the second quarter of an expected revenue decline between 7 to 9 percent year over year.
GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.55, or $0.87 to $0.89, excluding approximately $0.34 for restructuring-related and acquisition-related adjustments. This compares to the GAAP earnings per share guidance that the company previously provided for the second quarter of $0.65 to $0.75, or $0.95 to $1.05, excluding approximately $0.30 per share for restructuring-related and acquisition-related adjustments.
This revised second quarter outlook reflects a weaker than expected demand environment, particularly in Europe, and a larger than expected impact from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. The weaker demand environment prevented the company from overcoming this currency shift.
Looking ahead, the company expects these same factors to impact the second half of 2012 and will provide an update on its full year 2012 outlook on the companys upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Tuesday, July 24, 2012.
No conference call will be held in conjunction with this revised financial outlook and the company will have no further comment on this until its upcoming second quarter earnings release.

Lexmark reports second quarter 2012 results
LEXINGTON, Ky.,  July 24, 2012  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012.
Lexmarks second quarter results were below our April guidance, reflecting weaker than expected demand, particularly in Europe, and unfavorable currency impacts, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.

We are confident in our strategy and competitive strength, and will continue to closely monitor the challenging demand environment and make adjustments accordingly as we move through the year.
Second Quarter Results

Lexmark also has been positioned by leading European-based industry analyst firm Quocirca as a market leader in the firm's 2012 report, Vendor Landscape: Managed Print Services.

The solution can then intelligently pass the content on to a data management system, enterprise resource planning system or financial management system. The Distributed Intelligent Capture Solution eliminates the need for templates, keywords, zones or other rules-based techniques, allowing it to work with a variety of document types and layouts.

Item 8.01.  Other Events.
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) approved the repurchase of an additional $750 million of its Class A Common Stock, raising its share repurchase authority to approximately $1 billion at that time.  After entering into the transaction described below, the Company now has approximately $151 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
After the close of the markets on July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), through its agent Barclays Capital Inc. (the ASR Agreement).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $35 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Barclays.  The ASR Agreement requires Barclays to deliver to the Company on August 1, 2012, a number of shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $17.33, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on July 27, 2012, less an agreed upon discount.  The final number of shares to be delivered to the Company by Barclays under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by Barclays, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to Barclays as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the quarter ending September 30, 2012.  The payment of $35 million by the Company to Barclays for the repurchase of shares will be funded from available U.S. cash equivalents and current marketable securities.

The August 2012 Plan includes restructuring actions including the exiting of the development and manufacturing of the Companys remaining inkjet hardware.

The Company expects the non-manufacturing actions to be principally complete by the end of 2013 and the closing of the Cebu, Philippines inkjet supplies manufacturing facility by the end of 2015.
The August 2012 Plan is expected to impact about 1,700 positions worldwide, including 1,100 manufacturing positions. The August 2012 Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million with approximately $110 million incurred in 2012 ($75 million of which will be incurred in the third quarter of 2012), $30 million incurred in 2013, and the remaining $20 million incurred in 2014 and 2015.  The Company expects the total cash cost of the August 2012 Plan to be approximately $75 million with approximately $40 million incurred in 2012 ($5 million of which will be incurred in the third quarter of 2012), $30 million impacting 2013, and the remaining $5 million impacting 2014 and 2015.
Lexmark expects the August 2012 Plan to generate savings of approximately $1 million in 2012, approximately $85 million in 2013 and ongoing annual savings beginning in 2015 of approximately $95 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
   
 
 
Lexmark announces restructuring
 
 
August 28, 2012  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced restructuring actions, including the exiting of the development and manufacturing of the companys remaining inkjet hardware, which are expected to result in annualized savings of $95 million once fully implemented. Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.
LEXINGTON, K
y
.,
 
Todays announcement represents difficult decisions, which are necessary to drive improved profitability and significant savings, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Our investments are focused on higher value imaging and software solutions, and we believe the synergies between imaging and the emerging software elements of our business will continue to drive growth across the organization.
As we move forward, we remain confident in our strategy, competitiveness and ability to create value for shareholders, added Rooke.
Taking Actions to Improve Profitability
The restructuring actions announced today are expected to result in reductions primarily in inkjet-related infrastructure as well as positions in research and development, supply chain and other support functions.
The actions include closing the Cebu, Philippines, inkjet supplies manufacturing facility by the end of 2015. The actions also include eliminating inkjet development worldwide, including costs related to facilities, tooling, equipment, contract termination, and scrapping in process inventory, which are expected to be principally complete by the end of 2013.
These restructuring actions are expected to result in the elimination of approximately 1,700 positions worldwide, including 1,100 manufacturing positions.
The company is working with its strategic advisors to explore the sale of the companys inkjet-related technology.
These actions are expected to generate $85 million savings in 2013, increasing to ongoing annualized savings of $95 million beginning in 2015. Savings should be split
 
 
 
approximately 65 percent to operating expense, and 35 percent to cost of goods sold. The company expects the majority of these savings to favorably impact pre-tax earnings.
The total program pre-tax cost for these actions is expected to be $160 million, with $110 million incurred in 2012, $30 million incurred in 2013, and the remaining $20 million incurred in 2014 and 2015. The total program cash flow impact for these actions is expected to be $75 million, with $40 million impacting 2012, $30 million impacting 2013, and the remaining $5 million impacting 2014 and 2015.
Maintaining Capital Allocation Discipline to Deliver Shareholder Value
Lexmark is continuing to execute on its previously announced capital allocation framework of returning more than 50 percent of free cash flow to shareholders, on average, through dividends and share repurchases, while building and growing its solutions and software business through expansion and acquisitions.
(1)
Lexmark today announced that it plans an additional $100 million of share repurchases in the third and fourth quarter of 2012. With this action completed, Lexmark will have returned, through paid and declared dividends and share repurchases, more than $500 million to shareholders since mid-2011.
Lexmarks Board of Directors approved an additional $200 million of share repurchase authority. Total share repurchase authority remaining after the additional $100 million repurchases will be $251 million.

Lexmark reports third quarter 2012 results
LEXINGTON, Ky.,  Oct. 23, 2012  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012.
Third Quarter Results
GAAP revenue of $919 million includes $2.0 million of acquisition-related adjustments. Non-GAAP revenue of $921 million declined 11 percent compared with last year.
1
GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2012 were $0.00, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.86 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share, about flat compared with non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 per share in the third quarter of 2011.
Our third quarter financial results were highlighted by solid free cash flow generation and ongoing growth in Perceptive Software and managed print services revenue, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Even with the ongoing economic weakness we are seeing, particularly in Europe, revenue for the quarter was in line with the guidance we provided in July, and non-GAAP EPS were about flat year to year and exceeded that guidance.
 
Last week we announced a broad array of solutions-enabled laser products that further strengthen our smart multifunction product and managed print services leadership, added Rooke. We continue to leverage our investment in the Perceptive Software portfolio in combination with our smart multifunction products to reduce the complexities of manual processes and improve productivity for our customers.
We remain committed to delivering a long-term operating income margin of 11 to 13 percent and continue to maintain capital allocation discipline to deliver shareholder value, Rooke added. In the past 15 months, we have returned more than $500 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
 
 
Imaging Solutions and Services (ISS) revenue of $879 million declined 13 percent compared to the same period last year. Within ISS, Managed Print Services (MPS) revenue grew 2 percent, Non-MPSrevenue declined 12 percent and Inkjet Exit revenue declined 29 percent year to year. Inkjet Exit revenue represented 16 percent of total revenue and is expected to decline with the company's decision to exit its remaining inkjet hardware for improved profitability.

4
Perceptive Software revenue was $41 million. Perceptive Software revenue, excluding acquisition-related adjustments of $2.0 million, was $43 million and grew 88 percent compared to the same period in 2011.
Lexmarks focus continues to be on growing workgroup laser hardware and supplies, MPS, and software revenue as inkjet continues to become a less significant portion of the companys revenue mix.
Hardware revenue and Supplies revenue declined 24 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
Software and Other revenue grew 25 percent, or 28 percent excluding acquisition-related adjustments.

Third Quarter 2012 Non-GAAP results:
Maintaining Capital Allocation Discipline to Deliver Shareholder Value
Lexmark is continuing to execute on its previously announced capital allocation framework of returning more than 50 percent of free cash flow to shareholders, on average, through quarterly dividends and share repurchases while building and growing its solutions and software business through expansion and acquisitions. Lexmark has returned more than $500 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases since July 2011.
5
In the third quarter of 2012, Lexmark paid a dividend of $0.30 per share totaling $21 million. The company also repurchased 5.8 million of the companys shares for $120 million. An additional $15 million was paid during the third quarter to repurchase shares, with the final settlement of these shares expected to occur in the fourth quarter. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization is currently $251 million.
 
 
 
The company ended the quarter with $859 million in cash and current marketable securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $133 million. Free cash flow was $95 million. Capital expenditures were $38 million. Depreciation and amortization was $81 million.
Lexmark Extends Smart MFP Leadership with New Solutions-Enabled Laser Products
Last week, Lexmark announced a wide breadth of new laser printers and multifunction products (MFPs) built on an enhanced technology platform that delivers productivity-enhancing solutions.
Lexmarks smart MFPs include an intuitive touch screen that provides access to many powerful applications that reduce the complexities of manual processes and improve productivity. This seamless integration of Lexmarks smart MFPs with the Perceptive Software portfolio helps improve infrastructure efficiency and team performance to propel growth.
Some of the newest additions to Lexmarks printer and MFP product families include:
 
 
 
Lexmarks Value Proposition Resonates with Fortune Global 50 Companies
 
Statoil, a leading energy company within the oil and gas production industry, has chosen Lexmark for a five-year printing solution services agreement approximately valued at $20 million for the initial contract period. Lexmark is now the sole printing solution services provider for Statoil operations worldwide. Lexmark solutions and services will be executed globally throughout Statoil's organization, providing consistency and visibility to its output fleet.
Siemens, a global powerhouse in electronics and electrical engineering, has selected Perceptive Intelligent Capture, powered by Brainware, for the automation of accounts payable operations within the companys European Shared Services Center in Germany. The customer will implement Perceptive Softwares intelligent data capture platform for the processing of more than 1.5 million invoices annually, with the possibility of expanding these capabilities to other document-driven routines throughout the organization. This contract represents another clear example of Perceptive Intelligent Captures value proposition as an enabler of world-class efficiency and process transparency within the framework of global shared services.
Perceptive Software recently announced that ING Group, one of the worlds largest banks with more than $1.6 trillion in assets, has implemented Perceptive Intelligent Capture, powered by Brainware, for the efficient capture and validation of header and line-item data from paper-based documents at the financial institutions headquarters in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. No other data capture offering can match Perceptive Intelligent Captures out-of-the-box capabilities for integration with disparate content management platforms, handling numerous languages, addressing different and complex reporting requirements, and touchless processing of P.O.-based invoices.
Looking Forward
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company currently expects revenue to decline 10 to 12 percent year on year. GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to be around $0.17 to $0.27, compared with GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to be around $0.82 to $0.92, compared with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.25 in the fourth quarter of 2011.

This data is then presented in the context of the patient, so when the physician pulls up a patient record in the EMR, all clinical content living outside that record is presented, added Coons. This immediate, broad view of the patient drives both efficiencies and better patient care. Presenting this powerful content-based medical record in one solution will be unique to the market.
Combining Acuo Technologies clinical content solutions with Perceptive Softwares content and process expertise allows us to offer healthcare customers more compelling end-to-end solutions that integrate and manage both medical image and document-centric patient information, all integrated with the EMR, said Jeff Timbrook, Acuo Technologies chief executive officer. We look forward to presenting this broad offering to existing Acuo Technologies, Perceptive Software and Lexmark healthcare customers.

Lexmark reports fourth quarter and full year 2012 results
LEXINGTON, Ky.,  Jan. 29, 2013  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012.
 
Our fourth quarter financial results were highlighted by revenue that exceeded expectation, solid cash flow generation and ongoing growth in Perceptive Software and managed print services revenue, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. 
 
In 2012 we strengthened our solutions portfolio through four software company acquisitions, and launched one of Lexmarks most significant laser line advancements with solutions-enabled devices that extend our smart MFP and managed print services leadership. 
 
We are expecting to deliver savings of $85 million in 2013 from the actions announced last August, and we are well positioned to generate positive free cash flow as we have for each of the past 11 years, added Rooke. We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy of rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while pursuing acquisitions that further expand and strengthen our solutions offerings. 
Fourth Quarter Results
GAAP revenue of $967 million includes $1 million of acquisition-related adjustments. Non-GAAP revenue of $968 million declined 9 percent compared with last year.
1
Fourth quarter EPS were negatively impacted by $0.25 per share ($17 million) from higher than expected taxes. A mix shift of earnings toward higher tax geographies resulted in an unfavorable impact of $11 million ($0.16 per share) as compared to the companys October guidance.
Also, because the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not completed until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefitting the companys 2012 federal taxes, including the extension of the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for 2012, cannot be recognized in the companys 2012 financial results and
 
 
 
 
 
instead will be reflected in the companys 2013 financial results. This delay unfavorably impacted earnings by $6 million ($0.09 per share).
GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.10, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.94 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.61 per share compared with non-GAAP earnings of $1.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Imaging Solutions and Services (ISS) revenue of $925 million declined 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Within ISS, Managed Print Services (MPS) revenue of $170 million grew 3 percent, Non-MPSrevenue of $608 million declined 9 percent and Inkjet Exit revenue of $147 million declined 26 percent year to year. Inkjet Exit revenue represented 15 percent of total company revenue and is expected to decline as a percentage of total revenue with the company's decision to exit its remaining inkjet hardware for improved profitability.

Perceptive Software revenue was $42 million. Perceptive Software revenue, excluding acquisition-related adjustments of $1 million, was $43 million and grew 37 percent compared to the same period in 2011.
Hardware revenue of $222 million and Supplies revenue of $656 million declined 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Software and Other revenue of $89 million grew 27 percent, or 25 percent excluding acquisition-related adjustments.
Lexmark continues to focus on growing workgroup laser hardware and supplies, MPS, and software revenue as inkjet continues to become a less significant portion of the companys revenue mix.

Full Year 2012 Results
GAAP revenue of $3.798 billion includes $5.5 million of acquisition-related adjustments. Non-GAAP revenue of $3.803 billion declined 9 percent compared with last year. As with fourth quarter results, full year 2012 EPS were impacted by a higher overall tax rate resulting from the geographic mix of earnings and the delay in passage of the R&E tax credit.

GAAP earnings per share for the full year of 2012 were $1.53, compared with GAAP earnings of $4.12 per share in the full year of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings were $3.51 per share, compared with non-GAAP earnings of $4.71 per share in the full year of 2011.

Also, 0.7 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter settled in the fourth quarter.
In the full year 2012, Lexmark paid a dividend of $1.15 per share totaling $79 million. The company also repurchased 8.1 million of the companys shares for $190 million during the year. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization is currently $251 million.
Also in the fourth quarter, the company acquired Acuo Technologies, a recognized leader in high performance medical software and services. Acuo was the fourth acquisition in 2012, showcasing Lexmarks transition to being a key solutions provider to enterprise-sized businesses and organizations across the globe.
Lexmarks Perceptive Software Expands Healthcare Presence and Expertise
Perceptive Softwares expanded healthcare sector presence and expertise are evident in the acquisition of Acuo Technologies, the U.S. Department of Defenses selection of its Universal Clinical Platform, and Perceptive Softwares ranking as the top healthcare Document Management and Imaging software product by a leading industry research firm.

Item 8.01.  Other Information.
After the close of the markets on January 29, 2013, Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch (JPMorgan).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will purchase $21 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from JPMorgan.  The ASR Agreement requires JPMorgan to deliver to the Company on February 1, 2013, 751,896 shares, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $23.74, the closing price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on January 29, 2013.  The number of shares to be delivered to the Company by JPMorgan under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to the Company is less than the initial delivery of shares by JPMorgan, the Company may be required to remit shares or cash to JPMorgan as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2013.
After entering into the transaction described above, the Company now has approximately $230 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

2013 Incentive Compensation Award Opportunities for Named Executive Officers
On February 20, 2013, the Compensation and Pension Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) granted annual incentive compensation award opportunities with respect to the 2013 calendar year (the IC Performance Period) to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 402(a)(3)), pursuant to the Senior Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the Senior Executive IC Plan). The maximum award which may be earned under the Senior Executive IC Plan by any Named Executive Officer is equal to six-tenths of one percent of Operating Income (as defined in the Senior Executive IC Plan) for the IC Performance Period. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce, but not increase, the award made to a Named Executive Officer based on any factors that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee under the Companys 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (2013 IC Plan).
Under the 2013 IC Plan, the corporate performance measures include strategic revenue, operating income, cash cycle days and individual performance.  Business or geographic unit performance measures under the 2013 IC Plan include business unit or geographic unit strategic revenue (including license and subscription revenue for Perceptive Software), operating income, and cash cycle days (days sales outstanding for Perceptive Software). In the event minimum performance objectives are not met for any of the corporate performance measures and any of the business unit/geographic performance measures, if applicable, the Compensation Committee has established free cash flow as an alternative performance measure.  Each of the performance measures include restructuring charges, and generally exclude acquisition related adjustments and inkjet revenue.  The threshold, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2013 IC Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers, subject in each case to the maximum award amount under the Senior Executive IC Plan, are set forth in the following table.
 
 
 
2013 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Opportunities for the Named Executive Officers
Also on February 20, 2013, the Compensation Committee granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Rooke, time-based restricted stock units (RSUs) as a component of their long-term incentive award opportunity, but deferred the grant of performance-based award opportunities to give the Compensation Committee more time to consider the appropriate metrics for the long-term incentive plan.  It is expected that Mr. Rookes long-term incentive plan award opportunity will be 100% performance-based.
The time-based RSU awards will vest and settle in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2014, February 24, 2015 and February 24, 2016, based on the continued employment of the Named Executive Officer on each vesting date. The time-based RSUs awarded are set forth in the following table.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers with respect to and during the year ended December 31, 2012 in the Proxy Statement for the Companys 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2013.

claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information (or any part thereof), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the information in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement regarding the delivery of the Securities; (ii) the marketing names of the Underwriters on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement; (iii) the information in the third paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement concerning the offering price and selling terms; and (iv) the information in the seventh paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement concerning stabilization and other transactions.
Indemnification of the Company
(c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; , that, the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be

brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
 
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

listed on Schedule 1 to the Underwriting Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase from the Company of an aggregate principal amount of $[            ]of [            ]% Senior Notes due 20[ ] (the "Securities") contemplated in that certain Underwriting Agreement, dated as of [March [ ]], 2013 (the "Agreement"), made by and among the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 thereto. This opinion letter is furnished to you at the request of the Company and pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement. Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms used in this letter shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have assumed, for purposes of the opinions expressed herein, the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all original and certified documents and the conformity to original, or certified copies, of all copies submitted to us as reproduced or electronically transmitted copies. For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, we also have assumed that each of the Company, each Underwriter and the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the documents to which each is a party, and that such documents are valid, binding and enforceable obligations of each of the aforementioned parties. You have not asked us to express, and we do not herein express, any opinion as to the application of any federal or state law or regulation as to the authority of the Underwriters or the Trustee.
As to any facts relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon both certificates of public officials and certificates and representations of officers, or other representatives, of the Company and, in respect of such certificates and representations, we, and you, are justified in relying upon the same. With your permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made without any independent investigation, inquiry or verification on our part, and we express no opinion with respect to the subject matter or accuracy of the assumptions or items upon which we have relied.
 
We have examined such documents, records and matters of law as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of expressing the opinions herein. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations specified herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of the Agreement; each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) and (5), respectively, under the Securities Act on [February [27] and [28]], 2013, respectively; and, to the best of our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such Registration Statement has been received by the Company and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or, to the best of our knowledge, threatened by the Commission.
2. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, and (c) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date, in each case as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
3. Each Transaction Document conforms in all material respects to the summary descriptions thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
4. The descriptions of statutes, legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus are accurate in all material respects; the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus under the heading "Material U.S. federal income tax considerations," and incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus from Item 3 of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, to the extent that they constitute summaries of matters of law or regulation or legal conclusions, fairly summarize the matters described therein in all material respects;
5. To the best of our knowledge, (A) there are no current or pending legal, governmental or regulatory actions, suits or proceedings that are required under the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
 
and that have not been so filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
6. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
7. The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which we express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act.
We have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, representatives of its independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, and related matters were discussed. We have not participated in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, however, we have reviewed such documents. We have not independently verified and are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus except as set forth above, and then, only insofar as such information relates to the opinions expressed by us in those paragraphs. However, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness but excluding that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1)), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (the date of the Underwriting Agreement), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of its date and the Closing Date, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than (a) the financial statements and related schedules thereto, including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's report thereon, and (b) the other financial and accounting data that is included or incorporated by reference therein, in each case as to which we express no belief).
In basing the opinions and other matters set forth herein on "our best knowledge," the words "our best knowledge" signify that, in the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to our attention that would give us actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate or that any of the documents, certificates,
 
reports or information on which we have relied are not accurate or complete. The words "our best knowledge" and similar language used herein are intended to be limited to the current actual knowledge of the lawyers of our firm who have given substantive attention to legal matters for the Company, including, without limitation, in connection with the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
This opinion is subject to the following further assumptions, qualifications and limitations:
a. This opinion is limited to the federal laws of United States as currently in effect, and we express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction on the opinions expressed herein.
b. This opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein, and no opinion is implied by, or may be inferred from, the matters expressly stated herein.
This opinion is effective only as of the date first set forth above and furnished to you, by us, as counsel for the Company, solely for your benefit and solely with respect to the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters. In furnishing this opinion to you, as limited above, we are not hereby assuming any professional responsibility to any other person whatsoever and we disavow any obligation to update this opinion or advise you of any changes in this opinion in the event of changes in applicable laws or facts or if additional or newly discovered information is brought to our attention. Furthermore, no assurances can be given that future legislation, judicial or administrative changes, on either a prospective or retrospective basis, would not adversely affect the accuracy of the opinions stated herein. This opinion is provided to you as a legal opinion only and not as a guarantee or warranty of the matters discussed herein or discussed in the documents referred to herein, and may not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to by you for any other purpose, or by any other person for any purpose, without our express prior written consent.

Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, with respect to the holder of a substitute Security, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Registrar for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Registrar, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Registrar shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Registrar for cancellation.
Section 3.10
. Cancellation of Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and the Registrar shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities of such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced). Temporary Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities of such series without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Registrar upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge
Section 3.11
. Temporary Securities.
 
at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, and upon delivery to the Registrar of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Registrar shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities a like aggregate Principal Amount of definitive Securities of such series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
The Company in issuing the Securities of any series may use a "CUSIP" or "ISIN" number (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders of such series; provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent of any change in the CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers.
Section 3.12
. CUSIP and ISIN Numbers.
The Company, for the benefit of each series of the Securities, will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices, and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Registrar, and the Company hereby initially appoints the Registrar at its office or agency as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
Section 4.02
. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
 
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
(a) If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Section 4.03
. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
(b)
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities (other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument, which may be included in any supplemental indenture hereto, in which such Paying Agent will agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.03, that such Paying Agent will (i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Holders until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (ii) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series; and (iii) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, and upon the written request of that Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series.
(c)
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent will be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
(d)
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, or interest has become due and payable will be paid to the Company upon a Company Request (or, if then held by the Company, will be discharged from such trust); and the Holder of such Security will thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 calendar days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
(e)
Subject to Article 10, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and rights (charter and statutory); provided, however, that the Company will not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Each of the following events constitutes an "" wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series:
Section 5.01
. Events of Default.
Event of Default

(a)
default in the payment of any interest upon any Security when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; provided that failure by the Company to make such a payment shall not constitute an Event of Default if the Company makes such payment as required during such 30-day period; or

(d)
the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company, in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent

has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

. Waiver of Past Defaults.
With respect to the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee in good faith determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of that series or that may involve or cause the Trustee any potential liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction.
Section 5.05
. Control by Majority.
Upon receipt by the Trustee of any such direction with respect to the Securities of such series, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for determining the Holders of outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such direction. The Holders of outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.

. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, remaining unpaid on any Securities of such series and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof, including the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Section 5.08
. Collection Suit by Trustee.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 5.10 upon five Business Days prior notice to the Company.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 5.13
. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
No delay or omission of the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or of any Holder of Securities of any series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Section 5.14

Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any direction, notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the Company, pursuant to a resolution of its Board of Directors, or the Holders of at least ten percent in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding, may request the Registrar to fix a record date for determining Securityholders entitled to notice of and to take any such action. In case the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series in the amount above specified shall desire to request Securityholders of such series to take any action and shall request the Registrar to fix a record date with respect thereto by written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the Securityholder action to be requested; the Registrar shall promptly (but in any event within five days of receipt of such request) fix a record date that shall be a Business Day not less than 15 nor more than 20 days after the date on which the Registrar receives such request. If the Registrar shall fail to fix a record date as hereinabove provided, then the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series in the amount above specified may fix the same by mailing written notice thereof (the record date so fixed to be a Business Day not less than 15 nor more than 20 days after the date on which such written notice shall be given) to the Registrar. If a record date is fixed according to this Section 7.05, only Persons

provided
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.01, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities of the series the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Holders of all the Securities of such series, including without limitation, any Holder that revoked its consent in accordance with this Section.

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities of such series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01(c) with respect to outstanding Securities of such series, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and of the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.

The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of Notes, issue additional Notes (in any such case "") having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Notes. Any Additional Notes and the existing Notes will constitute a single series under the Indenture and all references to the Notes shall include the Additional Notes unless the context otherwise requires.
Additional Notes
(c) . The entire outstanding principal of the Notes shall be payable on March 15, 2020.
Maturity Date
(d) .
Interest Rate
(i) The rate at which the Notes shall bear interest shall be 5.125% per annum, subject to Section 2.02(d)(ii); the date from which interest shall accrue on the Notes shall be March 4, 2013, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for; the Interest Payment Dates for the Notes shall be March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2013; the interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, will be paid, in immediately available funds, to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be March 1 or September 1, as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the respective Holders on such Regular Record Date, and such defaulted interest, may be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Securities Administrator, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of principal and interest on this Note will be made by wire transfer, as directed by the Holder, in immediately available funds to a Dollar account maintained by the Depositary or its nominee with respect to a Global Note, and to the Holder or its nominee with respect to a Physical Security; provided that (1) in the case of a Physical Security, the Holder thereof shall have provided written wiring instructions to the Securities Administrator on or before the related Record Date and (2) if appropriate instructions for any such wire transfer are not received by the related Record Date, then such payment shall be made by check drawn on a U.S. bank mailed to the address of the Holder specified in the Register. Upon final payment due on the Maturity of a Security, the Holder thereof shall present and surrender such Security at the Corporate Trust Office of the Securities or at the office of any other Paying Agent on or prior to such maturity.
 
(ii) The interest rate payable on the Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, in the manner described below.
If the rating from Moody's of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator and the interest rate on the Notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If the rating from S&P of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator and the interest rate on the Notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P, as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator and the interest rate on the Notes will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the applicable ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 or higher, and S&P increases its rating to BBB- or higher, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator and the interest rate on the Notes will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rate on the Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment
 
described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) and the Company shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator if the Notes become rated A3 and A- or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or one of these ratings if the Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency).
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate payable for the Notes be reduced to a rate below the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance.
If either Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P ceasing to provide a rating. If both Moody's and S&P cease to provide a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. Neither the Trustee nor the Securities Administrator (in any of its capacities) shall have any duty or obligation of any nature whatsoever to monitor the ratings of the Notes or to monitor if either Moody's or S&P is then rating the Notes. The Company shall provide the Trustee and the Securities Administrator notice of any change in the ratings of the Notes and in the agencies rating them and shall be solely responsible for calculating (and providing written notice of such calculation to the Trustee and the Securities Administrator) any change in the interest rate at which interest accrues on the Securities.
If the interest rate payable on the Notes is increased as described in this Section 2.02(d)(ii), then the term "interest", as used in this First Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
(e) . The currency of denomination of the Notes is United States Dollars. Payment of principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Notes will be made in United States Dollars.
Currency
 
Section 2.03. .
Optional Redemption
(a) The provisions of Article 11 of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
(b) At any time and from time to time, the Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the Principal Amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date for the Notes.
(c) On and after the Redemption Date for the Notes, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price. On or before the Redemption Date for the Notes, the Company will deposit with the Securities Administrator in its capacity as the Paying Agent or the Trustee, funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed will be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided however, such method shall be in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed or, if the Securities are not listed but are in global form, then by lot or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depositary or, if the Securities are not listed and not in global form on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate; provided further that no Notes of a Principal Amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
(d) Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed provided however that if the Securities Administrator is asked to give such notice it shall be notified in writing of such request at least 15 days prior to the date of the giving of such notice. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
(e) In relation to the actions and duties of the Trustee in connection with redemptions, including under Section 2.03(c) hereof, the Trustee appoints the Securities Administrator in its capacity as Paying Agent to carry out those duties and actions.

On March 8, 2013, the Compensation and Pension Committee (the Compensation Committee) of the Board of Directors of Lexmark International, Inc. (the Company) granted each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Rooke, a 2013 long-term incentive (LTI) award opportunity comprised as follows: (i) a cash-based award for the 2013-2015 performance period, representing 28% of the total LTI award opportunity; (ii) performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs) for the 2013-2015 performance period, representing 28% of the total LTI award opportunity; (iii) performance-based RSUs for the 2013 performance period, representing 14% of the total LTI award opportunity; and (iv) time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), granted by the Compensation Committee on February 20, 2013, representing 30% of the total LTI award opportunity.
Mr. Rookes 2013 LTI award opportunity is 100% performance-based and excludes time-based RSUs.  Mr. Rookes 2013 LTI award opportunity is comprised as follows: (i) a cash-based award for the 2013-2015 performance period, representing 40% of the total LTI award opportunity; (ii) performance-based RSUs for the 2013-2015 performance period, representing 40% of the total LTI award opportunity; and (iii) performance-based RSUs for the 2013 performance period, representing 20% of the total LTI award opportunity.
Cash-Based LTI Award Opportunity
The cash-based LTI award opportunities were granted to the Named Executive Officers pursuant to the 2013-2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2013-2015 LTIP") established under the Companys Stock Incentive Plan. The performance measure for the 2013-2015 LTIP is the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against the TSR of companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index for the period commencing January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015. Under the 2013-2015 LTIP, each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive a cash award at the end of the performance period based on the Companys TSR rank measured against the companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index. The Compensation Committee will make this determination in 2016, and if earned, the cash payout will occur prior to March 15, 2016.
The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the performance period to earn an LTIP payout.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability (as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) or retirement (as defined in the Award Agreement) during the performance period, a prorated portion of the award may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the performance period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate prior to March 15, 2016.
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining any payout to an executive under the 2013-2015 LTIP applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
 
 
 
The minimum, target and maximum award opportunities established under the 2013-2015 LTIP for each of the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the following table:
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Opportunities
2013-2015 Performance Period
The performance measure for the performance-based RSUs for the 2013-2015 performance period is the Companys relative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measured against the ROIC of companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index for the period commencing January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015. The performance-based RSUs to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2016, and if earned will be settled on February 24, 2016. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the performance period to earn the performance-based RSUs. Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason, other than death, disability or retirement, will result in forfeiture of the award. In the event of a Named Executive Officers death, disability (as defined in the Companys Stock Incentive Plan) or retirement (as defined in the Award Agreement) during the performance period, a prorated portion of the performance-based RSUs may be earned based on the actual attainment as of the end of the performance period and will be paid to the executive or his or her estate on February 24, 2016.
2013 Performance Period
The performance measure for the performance-based RSUs for the 2013 performance period is the Companys services and software revenue. The performance period is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The performance-based restricted stock units to be awarded based on the Companys achievement of its objective, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee in 2014, with vesting and settlement of any earned performance-based restricted stock units to occur in three approximately equal installments (34%, 33% and 33%, respectively) on February 24, 2014, February 24, 2015 and February 24, 2016, based on the Named Executive Officers continued employment on each vesting date. The Named Executive Officer must be employed on the last day of the performance period to earn the performance-based restricted stock units.  Termination of employment prior to such time for any reason will result in forfeiture of the award.  The vesting of any earned performance-based restricted stock units after the end of the performance period will be accelerated in the event of the Named Executive Officers death, disability or retirement occurring after the completion of the performance period.
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion in determining whether performance-based RSUs shall be earned by a Named Executive Officer applying any factors that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
The minimum, target and maximum award levels for the performance-based RSU awards for the 2013-2015 performance period and the 2013 performance period are set forth in the following table.

"LTIP"
Agreement
"Company"
"Participant"
This Agreement is only a summary of the principal terms governing the LTIP.  The LTIP is subject in all respects to the terms of the Lexmark International, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the ). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.  It is important that the Participant read and understand the Plan and not rely solely on the brief description that follows.  All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Plan
Overview
The LTIP is designed to reward the achievement of a specific performance measure over a three-year period.  The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the ) established the Performance Measure, as defined below, for the performance period beginning January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015 (the ).
Committee
Performance Period
Depending upon the Company's attainment of the Performance Measure, the Participant may be eligible to receive a payment under the LTIP, as set forth below.
Performance Measure
The Committee has established the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return () measured against the average TSR of the companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index as the performance measure for the Performance Period (the ).  The calculation of TSR for the Company and for the companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index, will reflect the appreciation (depreciation) in the average closing stock prices of the Company and the companies in the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index for the 60-day period ending December 31, 2012 (the ) and the average closing stock prices for the 60-day period ending December 31, 2015 (the ), assuming that any dividends paid are reinvested on the date such amounts are paid to their respective shareholders.

Target Opportunity
The LTIP awards are denominated in cash, but in the Committees sole discretion may be paid in cash, the Companys Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and the Companys Class A Common Stock. For the Performance Period, your target award is [INSERT TARGET] ().
Target
The chart below illustrates how the LTIP awards will be calculated.
To the extent the Companys TSR during the Performance Period ranks in a percentile between the 25 and 90 percentile of the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index, then the LTIP payment shall be interpolated
th
th
 
 
 
between the corresponding LTIP payment amounts, set forth above.  For example, if the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index for the Performance Period is at the 45 percentile, the Participant shall be eligible to receive an LTIP payment equal to 75% of the Participants Target, subject to reduction in the Committees sole discretion.
th
Committee Discretion
The Committee may use its sole discretion in determining the amount of any payment, or no payment, to Participants under the LTIP and whether to reduce (but not increase) the amount of any payment based on any factors it deems appropriate.
Payout Timing
The Committee intends to review and approve the attainment of the Performance Measure following the end of the three-year Performance Period.  This review is expected to occur in a 2016 Committee meeting.  Payments will be made only after the Committee approval has occurred, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 2016.
Separation from Service
Except in the event of the death, Disability or Retirement (as defined below) of the Participant during the Performance Period, the Participant must be employed at the end of the Performance Period (December 31, 2015) to be eligible to receive a payout.  If the Participant should have a separation from service (as defined below) due to death, Disability or Retirement during the Performance Period, the payout, if any, is achieved based on the Companys TSR percentile rank within the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index as of the end of the Performance Period, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the separation from service due to death Disability or Retirement divided by 36, and will be made only after Committee approval has occurred after the end of Performance Period, and any such payments will be made no later than March 15, 2016.  For purposes of the LTIP, Retirement means termination of employment on or after the date the Participant attains (i) age 65 or (i) age 55, provided the Participant has 15 years of continuous service with the Company and its Subsidiaries on such date. For purposes of the LTIP, separation from service shall mean a separation from service from the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of Code Section 409A, using the default provisions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations, or any successor regulation thereto.
Change in Control
In the event of a Change in Control during the Performance Period, the Participant shall be entitled to a payout, as soon as practicable after the Change in Control, equal to the greater of Target or the actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index as of the date of the Change in Control, and will be prorated based on the number of complete months of service performed during the Performance Period prior to the Change in Control divided by 36.  If a Change in Control occurs after the Performance Period ends, but prior to the date of payment, the Participants payout, if any, shall be based on actual attainment of the Companys TSR measured against the S&P Mid-Cap Technology Index for the Performance Period.
Forfeiture of the Award
The Participant acknowledges that this opportunity for a long-term incentive award has been granted as an incentive to the Participant to remain employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and to exert his or her best efforts to enhance the value of the Company and its Subsidiaries over the long-term. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that if he or she (a) within 12 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, accepts employment with a competitor of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise engages in competition with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (b) within 36 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,

disrupts, damages, interferes or otherwise acts against the interests of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, recruiting, soliciting or employing, or encouraging or assisting the Participant's new employer or any other person or entity to recruit, solicit or employ, any employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries without the Company's prior written consent, which may withheld in its sole discretion, or (c) within 36 months of a separation from service with the Company, or its Subsidiaries, disparages, criticizes, or otherwise makes any derogatory statements regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their directors, officers or employees, or (d) discloses or otherwise uses confidential information or material of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, each of these constituting a harmful action, then the Participant shall immediately repay to the Company the full amount of the award received under the terms and conditions of the LTIP.  The Committee shall have the right not to enforce the provisions of this paragraph with respect to the Participant.
Participant agrees to be fully liable for any remedies available at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, for any breach of this above described covenant, promise and agreement.  Participant agrees to reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing the obligations of Participant.  This entire provision shall survive the termination of the Agreement and, in no manner, shall the remedies described herein be considered as the Companys exclusive or entire remedy for Participants breach, non-compliance or violation of this Agreement or any other agreement that Participant may have entered into with the Company.
Tax Withholding
In the event that the payout of the award is made in Class A Common Stock of the Company, delivery of such stock shall not be made unless and until the Participant, or, if applicable, the Participants beneficiary or estate, has made appropriate arrangements for the payment to the Company of an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding or other tax requirements, as determined by the Company.  To satisfy the Participants applicable withholding and other tax requirements, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold a number of shares of Class A Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the payout date equal to the applicable amount of such withholding and other tax requirements, subject to any rules adopted by the Committee or required to ensure compliance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Any cash payment made under this Agreement shall be made net of any amounts required to be withheld or paid with respect thereto (and with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock delivered therewith) under any applicable U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax withholding and other tax requirements.
Transferability
Unless otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the award granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by the Participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  The term Participant as used in this Agreement shall include any permitted transferee.
Interpretation; Construction
All powers and authority conferred upon the Committee pursuant to any term of the Plan or this Agreement shall be exercised by the Committee, in its sole discretion.  All determinations, interpretations or other actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan or this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons and, in the event of any judicial review thereof, shall be overturned only if arbitrary and capricious.  The Committee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel.

Amendment
The Committee shall have the right to alter or amend the LTIP and this Agreement in its sole discretion, from time to time, as provided in the Plan in any manner for the purpose of promoting the objectives of the Plan, provided that no such amendment shall impair the Participant's rights under the LTIP without the Participant's consent; provided, however, the Participants consent shall not be required for any amendment that impairs the Participants rights if the amendment is required by law. Subject to the preceding sentence, any alteration or amendment to the LTIP by the Committee shall, upon adoption by the Committee, become and be binding and conclusive. The Company shall give written notice to the Participant of any such alteration or amendment of the LTIP as promptly as practical after the adoption.

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 1, 2013, Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Lexmark), Lexmark International Technology, S.A., a Switzerland joint stock company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lexmark (LITSA and together with Lexmark, Sellers) and Funai Electric Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Funai), entered into a Master Inkjet Sale Agreement (the Master Agreement) to coordinate the sale of Sellers inkjet technology and related assets (the Inkjet Assets) to Funai.  Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Funai will purchase the Inkjet Assets for total cash consideration of $100 million (the Purchase Price).  Funai will pay $95 million of the Purchase Price at closing, and the remaining $5 million of the Purchase Price within 180 days after closing.
The sale of the Inkjet Assets to Funai pursuant to the Master Agreement will be effected by the execution and consummation of the following agreements: (i) a certain Share Purchase Agreement by and between LITSA and Funai; (ii) a certain Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai; (iii) a certain Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai (the IP Agreement); and (iv) a certain Transition Services Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai, each dated as of April 1, 2013 (collectively, with the Master Agreement, the Transaction Agreements).
Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, LITSA will sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., a Philippines corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LITSA (LIPI) to Funai.  The acquisition of LIPI by Funai includes LIPIs inkjet supplies manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines.  Under a separate agreement, Funai has agreed to be a contract manufacturer for inkjet supplies for Sellers.  For Sellers' customers and distributors, there will not be a disruption of service or support as they continue to work directly with Sellers.  Sellers will continue to support its installed base of customers in the sale of aftermarket inkjet supplies and will continue to provide customer technical and warranty support.
Funai will also purchase from Sellers certain assets related to the research, development, design, procurement, manufacture, test and sale of inkjet printers and cartridges, which are not owned by LIPI, as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.  In addition to the transferred assets, Sellers have agreed that for a period of 18 months after closing, Sellers shall designate up to 28 employees or independent contractors (leased employees) to provide services to Funai consistent with the Transition Services Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai.  Funai shall have the right to make conditional offers to hire any of the leased employees at any time during the 18-month transition period.
Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Sellers have agreed to provide certain transition services to Funai.  The leased employees will provide certain research and development services to Funai for up to 18 months, and Funai will reimburse Sellers for all costs and benefits of such employees.  In addition to the research and development services, Sellers shall provide IT staff professionals to assist with the transition of IT systems and financial services, as mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Funai.  Sellers have agreed to provide the IT transition services for three (3) months with Funai having an option to extend such services until the sixth (6) month anniversary of the closing date for certain additional costs.  Finally, Sellers have agreed to make available certain employees and independent contractors to provide certain development workshops, which shall be conducted within the six (6) month period immediately after closing.
th
In addition, Sellers have agreed to assign to Funai approximately 1,500 patents and patent applications, related to the Inkjet Assets pursuant to the IP Agreement.  Sellers have also granted to Funai a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use certain trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets and know-how pursuant to the IP Agreement.  Funai has agreed,

Exhibit 99.1
 
Funai acquiring Lexmarks inkjet-related technology and assets
LEXINGTON, Ky., April 1, 2013 Funai Electric Co., Ltd (TSE/OSE 6839) today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark International, Inc.s (NYSE: LXK) inkjet-related technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately JPY 9.5 billion).
 
Upon closing of the transaction, Funai will acquire more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmarks inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets. Through this transaction, Funai will acquire the capabilities to develop, manufacture and sell inkjet hardware as well as inkjet supplies. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close within the first half of 2013.
As an OEM manufacturer, Funai has manufactured inkjet hardware for Lexmark since 1997 and the companies have established a strong relationship over that time.
The acquisition of the inkjet-related technology and assets will enable Funai to launch new inkjet hardware and supplies under Funais own brands. Funai has established a strategy to develop and grow its inkjet printer business by introducing Funais own inkjet printers and supplies into the market. With the inkjet patents, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and comprehensive R&D capabilities, Funai will be able to accelerate the expansion of its inkjet business.
For Lexmark customers and distributors, there will not be a disruption of service or support as they continue to work directly with Lexmark. Funai will become a manufacturer of Lexmarks aftermarket inkjet supplies. Lexmark will continue to support its installed base of customers in the sale of aftermarket inkjet supplies and will continue to provide customer technical and warranty support.
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Lexmark on this transaction.

Supporting Quotes:
This transaction provides us with a crucial and tremendous opportunity to enhance our office solution business, said Funai president and chief executive officer, Tomonori Hayashi. Funai and Lexmark have developed a great partnership and we are glad to take over Lexmarks inkjet-related technology and assets. The acquisition of the inkjet-related technology and assets enables Funai to start and grow our own inkjet business. Funai will benefit from the strong inkjet business platform that Lexmark has established.
As we continue our transition to becoming a leading end-to-end solutions provider, this transaction essentially completes our exit from the ownership of inkjet-related assets, although we will continue to support our existing customer base with the sale of inkjet supplies, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. Funai has been a trusted partner of Lexmarks since 1997 and I am fully confident in Funais ability to deliver high-quality inkjet supplies for Lexmark.

Lexmark reports first quarter results
LEXINGTON, Ky.,  April 23, 2013  Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2013.
 
In the first quarter, Lexmark delivered revenue and EPS at the high end of our guidance range, and we continued to grow our higher value segments, said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. We also remain focused on our transition from a hardware-centric to a solutions-centric company with the acquisitions of two software companies and the recently announced agreement to sell Lexmarks inkjet-related technology and assets.
 
Lexmarks long history of free cash flow generation has enabled the company to complete eight software-focused acquisitions that are strengthening and expanding our solutions capabilities, and since 2011 return more than $500 million in combined dividends and share repurchases to our shareholders, added Rooke. 
 
First Quarter Results
GAAP revenue of $884 million includes $2 million of acquisition-related adjustments. Non-GAAP revenue of $886 million declined 11 percent compared with last year.
1
 
GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of 2013 were $0.54, compared with GAAP earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share compared with non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share in the first quarter of 2012.
The enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not completed until 2013. Certain provisions of the Act benefiting the companys 2012 federal taxes, including the extension of the research and experimentation tax credit for 2012, could not be recognized in the companys 2012 financial results and instead were reflected in the companys first quarter 2013 financial results. This favorably impacted earnings by $6 million ($0.09 per share).
 
 
 
Imaging Solutions and Services (ISS) revenue of $840 million declined 13 percent compared to the same period last year. Within ISS, Managed Print Services (MPS) revenue of $160 million grew 10 percent, Non-MPSrevenue of $558 million declined 12 percent and Inkjet Exit revenue of $122 million declined 34 percent year to year. Inkjet Exit revenue represented 14 percent of total company revenue and is expected to decline as a percentage of total revenue as the trailing inkjet supplies revenue from the installed base of inkjet printers decreases over time.

Perceptive Software revenue was $44 million. Perceptive Software revenue, excluding acquisition-related adjustments of $2 million, was $46 million and grew 54 percent compared to the same period in 2012.
Hardware revenue of $181 million and Supplies revenue of $609 million declined 9 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Software and Other revenue of $94 million grew 34 percent, or 37 percent excluding acquisition-related adjustments.
Lexmark continues to focus on growing workgroup laser hardware and supplies, MPS, and software revenue.
First Quarter 2013 GAAP results:
First Quarter 2013 Non-GAAP results:
In the first quarter of 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $38 million, free cash flow was negative $5 million, capital expenditures were $43 million, and depreciation and amortization was $62 million. The company ended the quarter with $880 million in cash and marketable securities.

Maintaining Capital Allocation Discipline to Deliver Shareholder Value
Lexmark is continuing to execute on its stated capital allocation framework of returning more than 50 percent of free cash flow to shareholders, on average, through quarterly dividends and share repurchases while building and growing its solutions and software business through expansion and acquisitions. Lexmark has returned more than $500 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases since July 2011.

In the first quarter of 2013, Lexmark paid a dividend of $0.30 per share totaling $19 million and also repurchased 0.9 million of the companys shares for $21 million. The companys remaining share repurchase authorization is currently $230 million.
 
 
 
Lexmark Strengthens and Expands Enterprise Content Software and Solutions
During the first quarter, Lexmark completed two acquisitions that expand and strengthen the companys enterprise content management software and solutions offerings.
Twistage offers an industry-leading, cloud software platform for managing video, audio and image content. Twistages framework easily integrates with customers existing applications and is flexible and adaptable  bridging gaps in a companys media management infrastructure.

Sale of Inkjet-Related Technology and Assets Announced
 
 
 
 
On April 1, 2013, an agreement was announced that Funai Electric Company, Ltd. will acquire Lexmarks inkjet-related technology and assets for approximately $100 million. Upon closing of the transaction, Funai will acquire more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmarks inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.

For Lexmark customers and distributors, there will not be a disruption of service or support as they continue to work directly with Lexmark. Lexmark will continue to support its installed base of customers in the sale of aftermarket inkjet supplies and will continue to provide customer technical and warranty support.
New Debt Issuance and Redemption
During the first quarter Lexmark issued registered public debt in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, maturing March 15, 2020. The seven-year unsecured senior notes have a coupon and effective yield to maturity of 5.125%. On March 31, 2013, Lexmark used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its $350 million, 5.90% Senior Notes at a premium of $3.2 million, prior to their scheduled June 1, 2013, maturity date. The remaining net proceeds from the $400 million debt issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including to repay other debt, finance capital expenditures and operating expenses, fund share repurchases, fund dividends, finance acquisitions, and invest in any subsidiaries.
Looking Forward
In the second quarter of 2013, the company expects a continued negative impact from the decision to exit inkjet. Revenue is currently expected to decline 6 to 8 percent year on year. GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2013 are expected to be around $0.42 to $0.52, compared with GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 in the second quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2013 are expected to be around $0.80 to $0.90, compared with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.89 in the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter 2013 guidance excludes expected gains from the closing of the inkjet sale transaction, which is scheduled to close in the second quarter of 2013.

(aa) "Section 409A Incentive Award" means any Incentive Award, which provides for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations, which is not otherwise exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(bb) "Stock Appreciation Right" means the right to receive a payment from the Company, in cash, Common Stock or a combination thereof, equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of exercise over a specified price fixed by the Committee (as specified in Section 6.7(c) hereof).

Participants separation from service from the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, using the default provisions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations.
2.2.   Except when otherwise indicated by the context, words in the masculine gender used in the Plan shall include the feminine gender, the singular shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular.
Gender and Number.
Participants in the Plan shall be those Employees selected by the Committee to participate in the Plan.
4.1.   The Committee shall have the discretionary authority, subject to the terms of the Plan, to determine the Employees to whom Incentive Awards shall be granted and the terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards, including but not limited to the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Incentive Award; the time or times at which Incentive Awards may be exercised, paid or transferred, as the case may be; whether Options shall be designated as Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options; the form and manner of payment of any amount due from a Participant in connection with any Incentive Award; whether any restriction (including any provision as to vesting, exercisability, payment or transferability) shall be modified or waived, in whole or in part, after the date of grant of the Incentive Award, provided, however, the Committee shall not modify or waive any restriction of any Section 409A Incentive Award that would result in an impermissible acceleration of payment in violation of Section 1.409A-3(j) of the Treasury Regulations, or otherwise violate Section 409A of the Code or any provision of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; the rights of a Participant with respect to any Incentive Award following the Participant's termination of employment; whether amounts payable by the Company in respect of any Incentive Award shall be paid in Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof; whether and to what extent any Incentive Award may be transferred by the Participant; and the terms, provisions and conditions to be included in any Incentive Award Agreement. The Committee shall not have the power to reduce, whether through amendment or otherwise, the exercise price of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right nor to grant a new Option, Stock Appreciation Right or other Incentive Award in substitution for or upon the cancellation of any previously granted Option or Stock Appreciation Right, which has the effect of reducing the exercise price, or exchange any Option or Stock Appreciation Right for stock, cash or other consideration, or take any other action that would be considered a repricing of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, unless in connection with an Adjustment Event as contemplated by Section 5.4 or approved by stockholders.
Power to Grant and Establish Terms of Awards.
The officers of the Company may suggest to the Committee the Participants who should receive Incentive Awards under the Plan. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the terms and conditions of each Incentive Award shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant, and such terms and conditions may be subsequently changed by the Committee, in its discretion, provided that no such change may be effected which would adversely affect a Participant's rights with respect to an Incentive Award then outstanding, without the consent of such Participant, or result in an impermissible acceleration of payment of any Section 409A Incentive Award in violation of Section 1.409A-3(j) of the Treasury Regulations, or otherwise violate Section 409A of the Code or any provision of the Treasury Regulations, or constitute a repricing as described in the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph. The Committee may establish different terms and conditions for different Participants receiving Incentive Awards and for the same Participant for each Incentive Award such Participant may receive, whether or not granted at different times. The grant of any Incentive Award to any Employee shall not entitle such Employee to the grant of any other Incentive Awards. Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may delegate, subject to such terms and conditions as it shall determine, to any officer of the Company or to a committee of officers of the Company, the authority to grant Incentive Awards (and to make any and all determinations related thereto) to Participants who are not, and are not expected to become, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Act and whose compensation will not be subject to the limitations on the deductibility thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code, subject to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporations Law.
4.2.   The Committee shall be responsible for the administration of the Plan. Any Incentive Award granted by the Committee may be subject to such conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine, in its discretion. The Committee, by majority action thereof, has discretionary authority to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
Administration.

regulations relating to the Plan, to interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan, to provide for conditions deemed necessary or advisable to protect the interests of the Company or to interpret the Plan and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration and interpretation of the Plan and to carry out its provisions and purposes.
4.3.   All of the powers and authority conferred upon the Committee pursuant to any term of the Plan shall be exercised by the Committee, in its discretion. All determinations, interpretations or other actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons and, in the event of any judicial review thereof, shall be overturned only if arbitrary and capricious. The Committee may consult with legal counsel, who may be counsel to the Company, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel.
Discretionary Authority of Committee.
5.1.   Subject to the provisions of Section 5.4, the number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan may not exceed 9,700,000, plus any shares that become available for grant pursuant to Section 5.2 (the Share Reserve). Shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan pursuant to any type of Incentive Award other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (including without limitation shares of Restricted Stock and shares delivered pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit and Deferred Stock Unit awards) shall count against the Share Reserve as 2.04 shares for every one (1) share issued. The shares to be delivered under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of Common Stock held in treasury or authorized but unissued Common Stock, not reserved for any other purpose, or from Common Stock reacquired by the Company.  No fractional shares shall be issued under the Plan. Cash may be paid in lieu of any fractional shares in settlements of awards under the Plan.
Number.
5.2.   Any shares of Common Stock subject to any portion of an Incentive Award and any shares of Common Stock subject to any award granted under the Predecessor Plan which, in any such case and for any reason, expires, or is canceled, terminated or otherwise settled, without the issuance of such shares of Common Stock, shall again be available for award under the Plan. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no shares available for issuance under the Predecessor Plan as of the Effective Date hereof shall be transferred to or available for issuance hereunder. No shares of Common Stock that are delivered to the Company, either actually or by attestation, in payment of the exercise price for any Option granted under the Plan or under the Predecessor Plan or in payment of applicable withholding taxes with respect to any Incentive Award or any award granted under the Predecessor Plan, and no shares repurchased by the Company on the open market using the proceeds from the exercise price of Options or otherwise, will be available for future grants under the Plan. Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights shall be counted against the Share Reserve based on the gross number of Stock Appreciation Rights granted rather than the net number of shares that may be issued under the award.
Canceled, Terminated, or Forfeited Awards.
5.3.   Incentive Awards assumed or granted in substitution or exchange for awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines will not reduce the shares that may be delivered under the Plan or authorized for grant to a Participant pursuant to Sections 6.1, 6.7 and 8.1.
Substitute Awards.
5.4.   The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for Incentive Awards, under Section 5.1, or subject to outstanding Incentive Awards, and the respective prices and/or vesting criteria applicable to outstanding Incentive Awards shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect, as deemed equitable and appropriate by the Committee, an Adjustment Event. To the extent deemed equitable and appropriate by the Committee, subject to any required action by stockholders, in any merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction, any Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall pertain to the securities and other property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Incentive Award would have been entitled to receive in connection with such event.
Adjustment in Capitalization.
Any shares of stock (whether Common Stock, shares of stock into which shares of Common Stock are converted or for which shares of Common Stock are exchanged or shares of stock distributed with respect to Common Stock) or cash or other property received with respect to any Incentive Award granted under the Plan as a result of any Adjustment Event, any distribution of property or any merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction shall, except as provided in Section 7.4, Section 9.3 or as otherwise provided by the Committee at or after the date any such award is made, be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and restrictions on exercisability or transfer, as are applicable to the Incentive Award with respect to which such shares, cash or other property is received, and any Award Agreement and stock certificate(s) representing or evidencing any shares of stock or other property so received shall so provide and be legended as appropriate.
 
5
 
 
 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Award Agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraphs, or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company as an entirety, the Committee shall equitably and proportionately adjust the performance standards applicable to any then-outstanding Performance Awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Performance Awards.
It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by this Section 5.4 be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.
6.1.   Options may be granted to Participants at such time or times as shall be determined by the Committee. Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock Options and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options, except that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary which qualifies as a subsidiary as defined under Section 424 of the Code.  The date of grant of an Option under the Plan will be the date on which the Option is awarded by the Committee or, if so determined by the Committee, the date on which occurs any event the occurrence of which is an express condition precedent to the grant of the Option. The Committee shall determine the number of Options, if any, to be granted to a Participant, provided that, in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock subject to all Options (or Stock Appreciation Rights) granted to any Participant under the Plan during any consecutive five-year period exceed 3,000,000 shares (adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4 if an Adjustment Event shall occur). Each Option shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the type of Option granted, the exercise price, the duration of the Option, the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Option pertains and such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall determine.
Grant of Options.
6.2.   Options granted pursuant to the Plan shall have an exercise price which is not less than the Fair Market Value on the date the Option is granted.
Option Price.
6.3.   Options awarded to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such restrictions or other conditions, including the performance of a minimum period of service or the satisfaction of performance goals, as the Committee shall determine. Once exercisable, an Option may be exercised from time to time, in whole or in part, up to the total number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which it is then exercisable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Option shall be exercisable for more than 10 years after the date on which it is granted.
Exercise of Options.
6.4.   The Committee shall establish procedures governing the exercise of Options, which shall require that notice of exercise be given and that the Option price be paid in full at the time of exercise (i) in cash or cash equivalents, (ii) in the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Qualifying Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to such Option price or in a combination of cash and Qualifying Common Stock; (iii) in the discretion of the Committee, by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option by the number of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option exercise price for the shares being purchased; (iv) in the discretion of the Committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option exercise price for the shares being purchased; or (v) in accordance with such other procedures or in such other form as the Committee shall from time to time determine. As soon as practicable after receipt of an exercise notice and payment of the exercise price in accordance with this Section 6.4, the Company shall direct its stock transfer agent to make (or to cause to be made) an appropriate book entry reflecting the Participant's ownership of the shares of Common Stock so acquired.
Payment.
6.5.   Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, no term of the Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code, or, without the consent of any Participant affected thereby, to cause any Incentive Stock Option previously granted to fail to qualify for the Federal income tax treatment afforded Incentive Stock Options under Section 421 of the Code. No more than 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock (adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4 if an Adjustment Event shall occur) may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options. If an Incentive Stock Option is granted, the aggregate Fair Market Value
Incentive Stock Options.
 
 
6
 
 
 
(determined on the date the Option is granted) of Common Stock subject to the Option which first becomes exercisable in any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 (otherwise, the Option, to the extent of such excess, shall be rendered a nonqualified stock option).
6.6.   The grant of any Option with a Reload Option feature (as defined below) is expressly prohibited.  A Reload Option feature is a feature of an Option that entitles a Participant who delivers shares of Common Stock that have been owned by such Participant for any minimum period of time specified by the Committee to exercise an Option to automatically be granted new Options ("Reload Options") for a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares so delivered.
No Reload Options.
6.7.
Stock Appreciation Rights.
(a) Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants at such time or times and with respect to such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be determined by the Committee and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may impose, provided that no Participant may receive Stock Appreciation Rights (or Options) under the Plan covering shares of Common Stock in excess of 3,000,000 (adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4 if an Adjustment Event shall occur) during any consecutive five-year period. Each grant of an Incentive Award of Stock Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
(b) Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised at such time or times and subject to such conditions, including the performance of a minimum period of service, the satisfaction of performance goals or the occurrence of any event or events, including a Change in Control, as the Committee shall determine. Stock Appreciation Rights which are granted in tandem with an Option may only be exercised upon the surrender of the right to exercise such Option for an equivalent number of shares and may be exercised only with respect to the shares of Common Stock for which the related Option is then exercisable. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may impose such conditions on the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right (including, without limitation, the right of the Committee to limit the time of exercise to specified periods) as may be required to satisfy the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 as promulgated under the Act or any successor rule.  No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable for more than 10 years after the date on which it is granted.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.4 of the Plan, upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment in cash, Common Stock or in a combination of cash and Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, of an amount determined by multiplying:
(i) any increase in the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of exercise over the price fixed by the Committee at the date of grant of such Stock Appreciation Right, provided such price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of grant, by
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.
6.8.   Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event a Participants employment with the Company and Subsidiaries terminates by reason of Retirement, Disability, death or special termination with the consent of the Company, all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then held by such Participant that are exercisable at the date of such termination of employment shall thereafter remain exercisable by the Participant or, if applicable, the Participant's beneficiary, for a period of one year from the date of termination, but in no event later than the expiration of the stated term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event a Participants employment with the Company and Subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than by the Company for Cause or by Retirement, Disability, death, or special termination with the consent of the Company, all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then held by such Participant that are then exercisable shall remain exercisable for the 90-day period immediately following such termination of employment or until the expiration of the term of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, whichever period is shorter. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of a Participant's termination of employment with the Company and Subsidiaries by the Company for Cause, all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then held by such Participant shall immediately terminate and be canceled, in full, on the date of such termination of employment. All Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are not vested as of the date of a Participant's termination of employment shall immediately terminate and be canceled on such date and all other Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate and be canceled on the date the period for exercise has expired to the extent not exercised prior to such date.
Exercisability Following Termination of Employment.

7.1.   The Committee may grant Incentive Awards of Restricted Stock to Participants at such times and in such amounts, and subject to such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, as it shall determine. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, any stock certificates evidencing any shares of Restricted Stock so granted shall be held in the custody of the Secretary of the Company until the Restriction Period lapses, or the Company may record the ownership of such shares in uncertificated book-entry form.  As a condition to the grant of any Incentive Award of shares of Restricted Stock, the Participant shall, upon request, deliver to the Company a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the shares of Common Stock covered by such Incentive Award. Each grant of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced by an Incentive Award Agreement.
Grant of Restricted Stock.
7.2.   Upon the expiration or termination of the Restriction Period and the satisfaction (as determined by the Committee) of any other conditions determined by the Committee, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse and the Company shall cancel and direct its stock transfer agent to make (or to cause to be made) an appropriate book entry reflecting the Participant's ownership of such number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed, free of all such restrictions, other than any imposed by applicable law. Upon request, the Company shall deliver to the Participant a stock certificate registered in such Participant's name and representing the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed, free of all such restrictions except any that may be imposed by law. No payment will be required to be made by the Participant upon the grant of an Incentive Award of Restricted Stock, except as otherwise provided in Section 12.4 of the Plan.
Lapse of Restrictions.
7.3.   Except as otherwise provided below, the minimum Restriction Period for an award of Restricted Stock subject to service-based vesting conditions shall be 36 consecutive months and the minimum Restriction Period for an award of Restricted Stock subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall be 12 consecutive months.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Restriction Period applicable to any award of Restricted Stock shall lapse, and such shares of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable, on the date of the Participant's termination of employment with the Company and the Subsidiaries due to death or Disability, or involuntary or constructive termination (as defined in Section 10.2) without Cause on or following the date of a Change in Control, subject in any such case to the Participant's continuous employment with the Company or a Subsidiary through such date. Except as provided in Section 12.1, shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until such time as the Restriction Period applicable thereto shall have lapsed upon the satisfaction of such conditions, including without limitation, the completion of a minimum period of service or the occurrence of such event or events, as shall be determined by the Committee.
Restriction Period; Restrictions on Transferability during Restriction Period.
7.4.   Participants granted shares of Restricted Stock shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to the Company's stockholders. In addition, Participants granted Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive, either currently or at a future date, as specified by the Committee, all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those shares, provided that if any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares of Common Stock or other property (other than cash), such shares and other property shall be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions and restrictions on transferability as apply to the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid; and provided further that if such dividends or distributions are paid in cash, the Committee may provide in its discretion that such dividends or distributions shall be credited to the Participants account, either in cash without interest or as reinvestment in additional shares of Restricted Stock (based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the dividend payment date). Any crediting of dividends or distributions shall be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as the underlying shares of Restricted Stock.  For avoidance of doubt, dividends or distributions with respect to any shares of Restricted Stock which vest subject to the achievement of performance goals shall only be paid to the extent the award vests and the performance goals are achieved.
Rights as a Stockholder.
7.5.   To the extent any stock certificate is issued to a Participant in respect of shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan prior to the expiration of the applicable Restriction Period, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear the following (or similar) legend:
Legend.
"The shares of stock represented by this certificate are subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Lexmark International, Inc. 2013 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, and the Incentive Award Agreement, dated as of ________________ between the Company and the Participant, and may not be sold, pledged, transferred, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered in any manner (except as provided in Section 12.1 of the Plan or in such Incentive Award Agreement) until ________________."
 
8
 
 
 
Upon the lapse of the Restriction Period with respect to any such shares of Restricted Stock, the Company shall, upon the Participant's request, issue or have issued new share certificates without the legend described herein in exchange for those previously issued.  Any share certificate which the Company issues at any time (whether before or after the Restriction Period with respect to such shares has lapsed) shall, in addition, bear any restrictive legend deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company or its counsel to comply with applicable securities laws.
7.6.                  .  The Committee may grant Incentive Awards of Restricted Stock Units to Participants at such times and in such amounts, and subject to such vesting and other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, as it shall determine.  Each grant of Restricted Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Incentive Award Agreement.
Restricted Stock Units
7.7       .  Except as otherwise provided below, the minimum vesting period for an award of Restricted Stock Units subject to service-based vesting conditions shall be 36 consecutive months and the minimum vesting period for an award of Restricted Stock Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall be 12 consecutive months.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the date of the Participant's termination of employment with the Company and the Subsidiaries due to death or Disability, or involuntary or constructive termination (as defined in Section 10.2) without Cause on or following the date of a Change in Control, subject in any such case to the Participant's continuous employment with the Company or a Subsidiary through such date.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, upon vesting and the satisfaction (as determined by the Committee) of any other conditions determined by the Committee, Restricted Stock Units shall be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, and the Company shall give appropriate directions to its transfer agent to make a book entry record reflecting the Participants ownership of such shares and, upon request, shall issue the Participant a stock certificate registered in such Participant's name and representing the number of such shares, which certificate shall contain any restrictive legend deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company or its counsel to comply with applicable securities laws.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide, in its discretion, in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock, for the Company to make a cash payment in full or partial satisfaction of any Incentive Award of Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value, as of the most recent trading day preceding the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest or otherwise become payable, of the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock.
Vesting and Settlement of Restricted Stock Units
7.8        The Committee may permit a Participant who has received an Incentive Award consisting of Restricted Stock Units to elect to defer the settlement to a specified date after the settlement date, as set forth in Section 7.7 or as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee that are intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Deferred Settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
7.9       .  Participants granted Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to such award and, without limitation, shall not be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to the Company's stockholders or receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to such award.  The Committee may, in its discretion, provide for dividend equivalent rights to be granted to a Participant with respect to any award of Restricted Stock Units.  Any such dividend equivalents shall be credited to a Participants account, either in cash without interest or as reinvestment in additional Restricted Stock Units (based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the dividend equivalent is credited). Any crediting of dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as the underlying Restricted Stock Units.  For avoidance of doubt, dividend equivalents with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which vest subject to the achievement of performance goals shall only be paid to the extent the award vests and the performance goals are achieved.
Other Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Units
8.1.   The Committee may grant Performance Awards which may be in the form of shares or units of Common Stock or valued by reference to a designated amount of property other than shares of Common Stock, including cash, to Participants at such times and in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, as it shall determine. The performance objectives to be achieved during any Performance Period will be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided that in no event shall (i) the maximum number of shares or units of Common Stock that may be delivered or settled (whether such settlement is in shares of Common Stock or cash) under all Performance Awards denominated in shares or units or Common Stock (other than Options and SARs, and without giving effect to any dividends or dividend equivalents) granted to any Participant under the Plan during any calendar year exceed 400,000 (adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4 if an Adjustment Event shall occur) or (ii) the maximum value of any payment that may be made (whether such payment is in cash or shares of Common Stock) under all cash-denominated Performance Awards granted to any Participant under the Plan during any
Grant of Performance Awards.
 
9
 
 
 
 
calendar year exceed $10,000,000. Each grant of Performance Awards shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
8.2.   Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, if the Committee determines that at the time a Performance Award is granted to a Participant who is, or is likely to be, a "covered employee" under Section 162(m) of the Code during any Performance Period, then the Committee may provide that this Section 8.2 is applicable to such Performance Award.
Code Section 162(m) Provisions.
(a) In addition to any other restrictions imposed on such Performance Awards, Performance Awards shall be earned or become vested, if at all, upon the determination by the Committee that performance objectives established by the Committee have been attained, in whole or in part. Such performance objectives shall relate to one or more of the following criteria: revenue; unit growth; free cash flow; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; net working funds; cash conversion cycle; days sales outstanding; days payables outstanding; accounts receivable delinquency; operating income; net income; earnings per share; working capital; inventory turnover rates; days of inventory; market share; return on investment; return on invested capital; return on equity; return on assets; profit margin; stock price appreciation; total shareholder return; shareholder value add; customer satisfaction; customer service; product quality; product awards; and software license bookings. Performance objectives may relate to the performance of the Company, a Subsidiary, an affiliate or a division or business unit, or a combination thereof, and may be established in either absolute terms or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies or on a per-share or pension-adjusted basis.
(b) The measurement of the Company's performance against its performance objectives may include or exclude, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of establishing the performance objectives, the impact of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and any other unusual or nonrecurring items, and the cumulative effects of accounting changes, each as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and as identified in the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements or management's discussion and analysis.
(c) The Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the number of shares of Common Stock to be granted to a Participant and/or the amount payable pursuant to a Performance Award.
8.3.   Performance Awards may be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the Performance Period, or at such later time, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Performance Award is a Section 409A Incentive Award, the Committee shall establish the time and form of payment for such Performance Award no later than the latest date permitted in accordance with Section 1.409A-2(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
Payment.
9.1.   Subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, a Participant may be permitted to make an election (a Deferral Election) to receive all or any portion of his or her annual cash bonus or other cash compensation in the form of Deferred Stock Units, with the number of such units determined by dividing the amount of the cash compensation that would have otherwise been paid to the Participant absent the election (the Deferred Amount) by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date such compensation would otherwise have been paid (the date of grant for purposes of this Section 9.1), rounded down to the nearest whole unit (the Elective Units). Deferral Elections shall be made in accordance with any other procedures developed by the Committee that are intended to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  The Company will establish a separate account for the Participant and will record in such account the number of Deferred Stock Units awarded to the
Deferred Stock Unit Awards.
With respect to any compensation that is not performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(e) of the Treasury Regulations, the Participants Deferral Election must be made no later than the fixed date established by the Committee for such deferral, and in no event later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which any services are performed for which such compensation is payable. With respect to any compensation that is performance-based compensation, the Participants Deferral Election must be made no later than the fixed date established by the Committee for such deferral, and in no event later than the date that is on or before the date that is six months before the end of the performance period, provided the Participant performs services continuously from the later of the beginning of the performance period or the date the performance criteria are established through the date a Participant makes his Deferral Election, and provided further that in no event may the Participants election to defer performance-based compensation be made after such compensation has become readily ascertainable, as determined in accordance with Section 1.409A-1(e) of the Treasury Regulations.

Participant. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, each Participant who receives an award of Elective Units shall receive an additional award of Deferred Stock Units (the "Supplemental Units") equal to the greatest whole number which may be obtained by dividing (x) 20% (or such other percentage as may be determined by the Committee) of the Deferred Amount, by (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.
9.2.   Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, each recipient of a Deferred Stock Unit award shall receive an amount equal to any dividends paid by the Company during the period of deferral with respect to the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock ("Dividend Equivalents"). Any Dividend Equivalents with respect to cash dividends on the Common Stock credited to a Participant's account shall be deemed to have been invested in shares of Common Stock on the payment date established for the related dividend and, accordingly, a number of Deferred Stock Units shall be credited to such Participant's account equal to the greatest whole number which may be obtained by dividing (x) the value of such Dividend Equivalent on the dividend payment date, by (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such date.
Dividends with respect to Deferred Stock Units.
9.3.   The portion of each Deferred Stock Unit award that consists of Elective Units, together with any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect thereto shall be fully vested at all times. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, the portion of each Deferred Stock Unit award that consists of Supplemental Units, together with any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect thereto, will become vested in full on the fifth anniversary of the date the corresponding Deferred Amount would have been paid absent the Participant's Deferral Election, provided the Participant remains in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary through such applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee provides otherwise, the portion of each Deferred Stock Unit award that consists of Supplemental Units, together with any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect thereto, will become vested in full on the date of the Participant's termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, due to death or Disability or involuntary or constructive termination (as defined in Section 10.2) without Cause on or following the date of a Change in Control, subject in any such case to the Participant's continuous employment with the Company or a Subsidiary through such date.  Any Deferred Stock Units that are not vested as of the date of the Participants termination of employment shall be forfeited.
Vesting of Deferred Stock Unit Awards.
9.4.   A Participant or his beneficiary shall not have any right in respect of Deferred Stock Units awarded pursuant to the Plan to vote on any matter submitted to the Company's stockholders unless and until such time as any shares of Common Stock attributable to such Deferred Stock Units have been issued to such Participant or his beneficiary, as applicable.
Rights as a Stockholder.
9.5.   Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant shall receive one share of Common Stock for each vested Deferred Stock Unit credited to his or her account (whether Elective Units, Supplemental Units or Dividend Equivalents) as of the earlier of (x) the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and (y) the date of such Participant's termination of employment due to Retirement (or six months and 1 day after termination of employment due to Retirement, if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations), death, or Disability, subject to Section 9.6 below.  The Committee may decide in its discretion to settle all or any portion of the Deferred Stock Units in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the most recent trading day preceding the applicable payment date.
Settlement of Deferred Stock Units.
(a) If permitted by the Committee, a Participant may elect to defer settlement of the Deferred Stock Units beyond the date specified in Section 9.5 or in the Award Agreement, as applicable, provided the following requirements are satisfied
:
(i) A Participants election to defer settlement of the Deferred Stock Units may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made by the Participant;
(ii) A Participants election to defer settlement of the Deferred Stock Units must delay settlement for a period of not less than five (5) years from the original settlement date set forth in Section 9.5, or as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement; and
(iii)
A Participants election to defer settlement of the Deferred Stock Units must be made at least 12 months prior to the settlement date set forth in Section 9.5, or as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement.
(b) In addition, the Company may delay settlement of the Deferred Stock Units if it reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate Federal securities laws or other applicable laws provided payment is made at the earliest date on which the
 
11
 
 
 
 
Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation.  The Company also reserves the right to delay payment upon such other events and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe in generally applicable guidance under Section 409A of the Code published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
 
 
10.1.   Subject to the provisions of Section 10.2 below, in the event of a Change in Control as defined in Section 2.1(f)(iii) in which the Company is not the surviving entity, (i) each Option and Stock Appreciation Right shall promptly become fully vested and exercisable; (ii) the Restriction Period applicable to all Restricted Stock shall expire and all shares shall become nonforfeitable and immediately transferable, (iii) all Performance Awards shall be promptly cancelled in exchange for a payment in cash of an amount equal to the pro rata share earned based on actual achievement as of the date of Change in Control; and (iv) all Deferred Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and immediately payable (provided that any Section 409A Incentive Award shall be subject to any limitations required by Section 409A of the Code). If an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is fully vested or becomes fully vested as provided in this paragraph but is not exercised or paid prior to a Change in Control triggered by Section 2.1(f)(iii) of the definition thereof and the Company is not the surviving entity, then the Committee may provide for the settlement in cash of the award (such settlement to be calculated as though the award was paid or exercised simultaneously with the Change in Control and based upon the then Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock). An Option or Stock Appreciation Right so settled by the Committee shall automatically terminate. If, in such circumstances, the Committee does not provide for the cash settlement of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, then upon the Change in Control such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate, provided that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right holder shall be given reasonable notice of such intended termination and an opportunity to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right prior to or upon the Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.1, Incentive Awards issued under the Plan may contain specific provisions regarding the consequences of a Change in Control and, if contained in an Award Agreement, those provisions shall be controlling in the event of any inconsistency. The occurrence of a particular Change in Control under the Plan shall have no effect on any award granted under the Plan after the date of that Change in Control.  The Committee may deem an acceleration of vesting of Incentive Awards pursuant to this Section 10.1 to occur sufficiently prior to an event if necessary or deemed appropriate to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the shares underlying the award; provided, however, that, the Committee shall reinstate the original terms of an award if the related event does not actually occur.
Accelerated Vesting and Payment.
10.2.   Notwithstanding Section 10.1, no cancellation, acceleration of exercisability, vesting, cash settlement or other payment shall occur with respect to any Incentive Award, other than a Performance Award or a Section 409A Incentive Award, if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control that such Incentive Award or class of Incentive Awards shall be honored or assumed, or new rights substituted therefor (such honored, assumed or substituted award hereinafter called an "Alternative Award") by the successor to the Company (or the parent or a subsidiary of such successor) immediately following the Change in Control, provided that any such Alternative Award must:
Alternative Awards.
(a) be based on stock which is traded on an established securities market, or which will be so traded within 60 days following the Change in Control;
(b) provide such Participant (or each Participant in a class of Participants) with rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than the rights and entitlements applicable under such Incentive Award, including, but not limited to, an identical or better exercise or vesting schedule and identical or better timing and methods of payment;
(c) have substantially equivalent economic value to such Incentive Award (determined by the Committee as constituted immediately prior to the Change in Control, in it's sole discretion, promptly after the Change in Control);
(d) have terms and conditions which provide that in the event that the Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated or constructively terminated (other than for Cause) upon or following such Change in Control, any conditions on a Participant's rights under, or any restrictions on transfer or exercisability applicable to, each such Alternative Award shall be waived or shall lapse, as the case may be; and
(e) satisfy the requirements of Section 1.409A-1(b)(v)(D) of the Treasury Regulations and (with respect to Incentive Stock Options) any applicable requirements under Code Section 424.
 
12
 
 
 
For this purpose, a constructive termination shall mean, unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, a termination by a Participant following a material reduction in the Participant's base compensation, a material reduction in the Participant's responsibilities or the relocation of the Participant's principal place of employment to another location a material distance farther away from the Participant's then current principal place of employment, in each case, without the Participant's prior written consent.
10.3 . With respect to the occurrence of any Change in Control other than a Change in Control described in Section 10.1 above, any conditions on a Participant's rights under, or any restrictions on transfer or exercisability applicable to, an Incentive Award that is outstanding as of the time of such Change in Control, shall automatically be waived or shall automatically lapse, as the case may be, in the event the Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated or constructively terminated (other than for Cause), as defined above, upon or following the date of such Change in Control.
Other Changes in Control
The Board may at any time terminate or suspend the Plan, and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan, provided, however, that any amendment which would (i) increase the number of shares available for issuance under Sections 5.1, 6.1, 6.7 and 8.1 (other than as contemplated by Section 5.4), (ii) reprice, replace or regrant Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Option or Stock Appreciation Right or exchange underwater Options or Stock Appreciation Rights for other awards, Common Stock, cash or other property; or (iii) materially modify the requirements for eligibility to participate in the Plan or expand the types of Incentive Awards that may be granted under the Plan, shall be subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders. No action of the Board may, without the consent of a Participant, materially impair such Participant's rights under any previously granted Incentive Award.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any Participant or approval of the Companys stockholders, amend the Plan or any outstanding Award Agreements, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as it deems necessary or advisable for the purpose of implementing Section 5.4 or Section 10 or conforming the Plan or such Award Agreement to any present or future law, regulation or rule applicable to the Plan, including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 409A of the Code and all applicable guidance promulgated thereunder.
12.1.   Unless the Board, the Committee or the Company's Vice President, Human Resources and Vice President and General Counsel shall permit an Incentive Award (other than an Incentive Stock Option) to be transferred by a Participant to a Participant's family member for estate planning purposes or to a trust, partnership, corporation or other entity established by the Participant for estate planning purposes, on such terms and conditions as the Board, the Committee or such officers may specify, no Incentive Award granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to any Incentive Award granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable by the transferee only for as long as they could have been exercisable by such Participant. If any Incentive Award is transferred to a family member, trust, partnership, corporation or other entity as contemplated by the first sentence hereof, all references herein and in the applicable Award Agreement to the Participant shall be deemed to refer to such permitted transferee, other than any such references with respect to the personal status of the Participant.
Nontransferability of Awards.
12.2.   Each Participant under the Plan may from time to time name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid or by whom any right under the Plan is to be exercised in case of his death. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Committee during his lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid or Incentive Awards outstanding at the Participant's death shall be paid to or exercised by the Participant's surviving spouse, if any, or otherwise to or by his estate.
Beneficiary Designation.
12.3.   Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate any Participant's employment or other service at any time and for any reason, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Company or any Subsidiary. No Employee shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to receive any Incentive Awards under the Plan.
No Guarantee of Employment or Participation.
 
13
 
 
 
12.4.   The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the power to withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company or a Subsidiary promptly upon notification of the amount due, an amount determined by the Company or the Subsidiary, in its discretion, to be sufficient to satisfy all Federal, state and local withholding tax requirements in respect of any Incentive Award, and the Company may defer payment of cash or issuance or delivery of Common Stock until such requirements are satisfied. The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy his tax withholding obligation hereunder in such other manner, subject to such conditions, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, (i) to have Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable under the Plan withheld by the Company; (ii) to deliver, either actually or by attestation, to the Company, Qualifying Common Stock, in each case, having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy all or part of the Participant's Federal, state and local withholding tax obligation; or (iii) through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell shares obtained upon the exercise of an Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale.
Tax Withholding.
12.5.   Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee or the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he may be made a party or in which he may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against him, provided that he shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he undertakes to handle and defend it on his own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive and shall be independent of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws, by contract, as a matter of law or otherwise.
Indemnification.
12.6.   Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries to establish other plans or to pay compensation to their employees in cash or property, in a manner which is not expressly authorized under the Plan.
No Limitation on Compensation.
12.7.   The granting of Incentive Awards and the issuance of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal securities laws), and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be appropriate or required, as determined by the Committee.  Any shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements.
Requirements of Law.
12.8.   The Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
Governing Law.
12.9.   Incentive Awards granted under the Plan are not compensation for purposes of calculating an Employee's rights under any employee benefit plan, except to the extent provided in any such plan.
No Impact on Benefits.
12.10.   Instruments evidencing Incentive Awards may contain such other provisions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee deems advisable, to comply with applicable securities laws.  The Committee may delay a Participants right to exercise an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise delay the issuance of any shares of Common Stock hereunder if it reasonably anticipates that such exercise or the issuance of such shares would violate any applicable securities laws.
Securities Law Compliance.
12.11.   Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant to this Plan shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, the executor, administrator or other personal representative or designated beneficiary of such Participant, or any other persons. Any reserves that may be established by the Company in connection with this Plan shall continue to be held as part of the general funds of the Company, and no individual or entity other than the Company shall have any interest in such funds until paid to a Participant. To the extent that any Participant or his executor, administrator or other personal representative, as the case may be, acquires a right to receive any payment from the Company pursuant to this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
No Right to Particular Assets.
12.12.   Each Participant shall be responsible for furnishing the Committee with the current and proper address for the mailing of notices and delivery of agreements and shares of Common Stock. Any notices required or permitted to be given shall be deemed given if directed to the person to whom addressed at such address and mailed by regular United States mail, first-class and prepaid. If any item mailed to such address is returned as undeliverable to the addressee, mailing will be suspended until the
Notices.
 
14
 
 
 
 
Participant furnishes the proper address.
12.13.   If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.
Severability of Provisions.
12.14.   Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receiving such benefit shall be deemed paid when paid to such person's guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment shall fully discharge the Committee, the Company and other parties with respect thereto.
Incapacity.
12.15.   The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of this Plan and shall not be employed in the construction of this Plan.
Headings and Captions.
12.16.   Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Plan to the contrary, unless the Committee otherwise determines at the time of grant, any Incentive Award made hereunder to an officer who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Act is intended to qualify as other performance based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and the Committee shall not be entitled to exercise any discretion otherwise authorized under the Plan with respect to such award if, and to the extent that, the ability to exercise such discretion (as opposed to the exercise of such discretion) would cause such award to fail to qualify as other performance based compensation.
Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code.
12.17.   The Company intends the Plan and any Section 409A Incentive Award to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Plan and any Award Agreement consisting of a Section 409A Incentive Award shall be administered in accordance with such intent.  If a Participant, who is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations, becomes entitled to payment of any Section 409A Incentive Award on account of his termination of employment, such payment shall be made at the time specified in his Award Agreement, provided, however, no payments under such Award Agreement shall be made until six months and one day after such termination of employment or the date of the Participants death, if earlier.
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
12.17.   Incentive Awards may be granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Incentive Awards to Participants in the United States as may be necessary or desirable, in the judgment of the Committee, to recognize differences in currency, local law or tax policy.  The Committee may establish procedures, including subplans and the like, as may be necessary to comply with provisions of the laws and applicable regulatory rulings of  other countries.
Foreign Employees.
12.18. .  All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Incentive Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, and the Plan and the Award Agreements hereunder shall be binding on all successors and assigns of a Participant, including, without limitation, the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participants creditors.
Successors and Assigns
12.19.   The amended and restated Plan was approved by the Board on February 21, 2013 and will become effective upon the approval of the Plan by stockholders at the 2013 Annual Meeting on April 25, 2013 (the Effective Date).  The Plan will terminate on February 21, 2023 (i.e., the tenth anniversary of the date on which it was approved by the Board), unless sooner terminated by the Board pursuant to Section 11.

Item 8.01.  Other Events.
Completion of Sale of Inkjet Technology and Related Assets
On April 30, 2013, Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Lexmark) and Lexmark International Technology, S.A., a Switzerland joint stock company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lexmark (LITSA and together with Lexmark, Sellers), completed the sale of their inkjet technology and related assets (the Inkjet Assets) to Funai Electric Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Funai), pursuant to the terms of a Master Inkjet Sale Agreement (the Master Agreement).
Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Funai agreed to pay one hundred million ($100,000,000) (the Purchase Price) in cash to Sellers to acquire the Inkjet Assets.  Ninety-five million dollars ($95,000,000) of the Purchase Price was paid to Sellers on April 30, 2013 (the Closing Date) and the remaining five million ($5,000,000) of the Purchase Price will be paid to Sellers 180 days after the Closing Date.  Cash proceeds from the transaction are predominantly non-U.S.
The sale of the Inkjet Assets by Sellers included (i) the sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., a Philippines corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of LITSA (LIPI), which included LIPIs inkjet supplies manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement by and between LITSA and Funai; (ii) the sale of certain assets related to the research, development, design, procurement, manufacture, test and sale of inkjet printers and cartridges, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai; (iii) the assignment to Funai of approximately 1,500 patents and patent applications related to the Inkjet Assets and the grant of a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use certain trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets and know-how, pursuant to the terms of an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai; and (iv) certain transition services pursuant to the terms of a Transition Services Agreement by and among Sellers and Funai.
The foregoing description of each of the agreements is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the agreements, copies of which will be filed as exhibits to Lexmarks Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2013.
Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement
After the close of the markets on April 25, 2013, Lexmark entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR Agreement) with The Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, Lexmark will purchase $20 million of the outstanding shares of its Class A Common Stock from Scotiabank.  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, Scotiabank delivered 612,171 shares to Lexmark on April 30, 2013, equal to 85 percent of the shares that would be repurchased at a price of $27.77, the closing price of Lexmarks Class A Common Stock on April 25, 2013.  The number of shares to be delivered to Lexmark by Scotiabank under the ASR Agreement shall be adjusted based on a discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of Lexmarks Class A Common Stock during the term of the ASR Agreement.  If the number of shares to be delivered to Lexmark is less than the initial delivery of shares by Scotiabank, Lexmark may be required to remit shares or cash to Scotiabank as a result of such adjustment.  The share repurchases are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2013.
After entering into the transaction described above, Lexmark now has approximately $210 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
