premium to its closing price on january the day prior to our announcement our goal in making such a generous offer was to create the basis for a speedy and ultimately friendly transaction despite this the pace of the last two months has been anything but there has been some limited interaction between management of our two companies there has been no meaningful negotiation to conclude an agreement we understand that you have been meeting to consider and assess your alternatives including alternative transactions with others in the industry but we seen no indication that you have authorized yahoo management to negotiate with microsoft this is despite the fact that our proposal is the only alternative put forward that offers your shareholders full and fair value for their shares gives every shareholder a vote on the future of the company and enhances choice for content creators advertisers and these two months of inactivity the internet has continued to march on while the public equity markets and overall economic conditions have weakened considerably both in general and for other companies in particular at the same time public indicators suggest that yahoo search and page view shares have declined finally you have adopted new plans at the company that have made any change of control more any fair measure the large premium we offered in january is even more significant

respective companies to authorize teams to sit down and negotiate a definitive agreement on a combination of our companies that will deliver superior value to our respective shareholders creating a more efficient and competitive company that will provide greater value and service to our customers if we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the yahoo board the substantial premium reflected in our initial proposal

strategy i am confident that we can continue to move forward toward our goals ballmer we are investing heavily in new tools and web experiences we have dramatically improved our search performance and advertiser satisfaction and we will continue to build our scale through organic growth and partnerships said kevin johnson microsoft president for platforms and is the text of the letter from microsoft ceo steve ballmer to yahoo ceo jerry jerry and chief first ca jerry over three months we have reached the conclusion of the process regarding a possible combination of microsoft and yahoo first want to convey my personal thanks to you your management team and yahoo board of directors for your consideration of our proposal i appreciate the time and attention all of you have given to this matter and i especially appreciate the time that you have invested personally i feel that our discussions this week have been particularly useful providing me for the first time with real clarity on what is and is not am disappointed that yahoo has not moved towards accepting our offer i first called you with our offer on january because i believed that a combination of our two companies would have created real value for our respective shareholders and would have provided consumers publishers and advertisers with greater innovation and choice in the marketplace our decision to offer a percent premium at that time reflected the strength of these our conversations this week we conveyed our willingness to raise our offer to per share reflecting again our belief in this collective opportunity this increase would have added approximately another billion of value to your shareholders compared to the current value of our initial offer it also would have reflected a premium of over percent compared to the price at which your stock closed on january yet it has proven insufficient as your final position insisted on microsoft paying yet another billion or more or at least another per share above our after giving this week conversations further thought it is clear to me that it is not sensible for microsoft to take our offer directly to your shareholders this approach would necessarily involve a protracted proxy contest and eventually an exchange offer our discussions with you have led us to conclude that in the interim you would take steps that would make yahoo undesirable as an acquisition for regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a hostile bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to google of key paid internet search terms offered by yahoo today in our view such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of yahoo undesirable to us for a number of reasons your apparent plan to pursue such an arrangement in the event of a proxy contest or exchange offer leads me to the firm decision not to pursue such a path instead i hereby formally withdraw microsoft proposal to acquire yahoo will move forward and will continue to innovate and grow our business at microsoft with the talented team we have in place and potentially through strategic transactions with other business still believe even today that our offer remains the only alternative put forward that provides your stockholders full and fair value for their shares by failing to reach an agreement with us you and your stockholders have left significant value on the clearly a deal is not to you again for the time we have spent together discussing in microsoft nasdaq msft is

and credit risks to enhance returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing eliminating and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for a derivative instrument designated as a hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged for a derivative instrument designated as a hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings for options designated either as or hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in certain assets liabilities and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk we

pound and canadian dollar certain dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as hedging instruments under sfas no certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency currency for derivative instruments and hedging equity investments are subject to market price risk from time to time we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities we determine the security selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions costs and other relevant factors certain options futures and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no are also used to manage equity price securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk we use option and futures contracts and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no to hedge interest rate rate swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no are used to manage exposures to credit risks enhance returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification in addition we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments to be announced forward purchase commitments of assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date

generally three years or is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist using a approach no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods assets are amortized using the method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to ten years we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization no material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods adopted accounting july we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under fin we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the

included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of control the interest sold as well as any interest retained will be recorded at fair value with any gain or

believe sfas no will have a material impact on our financial fair value option for financial assets and financial september the fasb issued sfas no which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information in february the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp which delays the effective

ordered us to license certain windows server protocol technology to our competitors in march the european commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by the march decision were not reasonable following additional steps we took to address these concerns the commission announced on october that we were in compliance with the march decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date on february the commission issued a fine of billion million relating to the period prior to october in january the commission announced that it was opening two new competition law investigations these investigations relate primarily to interoperability with respect to our microsoft office family of products and the inclusion of various capabilities in our windows operating system software including web browsing software these investigations were precipitated by complaints filed with the commission by a trade association of microsoft competitors and a firm that offers web browsing software in may we filed an application with the european court of first instance to annul the february fine we paid the billion million fine in june competition law are subject to a consent decree and final judgment that resolved lawsuits brought by the department of justice states and the district of columbia in two separate actions the consent decree imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses portions of the consent decree were scheduled to expire on january we voluntarily agreed to extend other elements of the consent decree to november in october some states filed a motion with the district court for the district of columbia seeking to have most of the remaining provisions of the final judgment in the action to which they are party extended for five years the department of justice and other states advised the court that they would not seek any extension of the final judgments to which they are party in january the court issued a decision granting the states motion to extend these additional provisions of the consent decree until november other ongoing investigations various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition privacy and security a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state federal and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in states courts refused to certify classes in two additional states we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in states and the district of unfair competition and overcharge class the settlements generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of computer hardware and software the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed to depending on the state the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately billion the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem settlements in all states have received final court approval cases in arizona mississippi and canada have not been settled we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between billion and billion the actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers and the cost of administering the claims at june we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately million which reflects our estimated exposure of billion less payments made to date of approximately million mostly for administrative expenses

more than patent infringement cases microsoft and are parties to a number of legal proceedings relating to certain patents of each of the companies some of these actions began before the merger of

motions any appeals and the results of the remaining trials adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this section may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would adversely affect distribution of our operating system or application products we may enter into material settlements because of these we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business although management currently believes that resolving claims against us individually or in aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position our results of operations or our cash flows these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management view of these matters may change in
