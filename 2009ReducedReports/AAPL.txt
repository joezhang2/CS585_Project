unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred in contrast the company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products such as macs and ipods at the time of sale as the company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of july the company began selling iphone the iphone and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over countries unit sales of iphone have been significantly

the company recognizes engineering sales and marketing expenses as incurred including expenses related to iphone and apple tv management uses adjusted sales to evaluate returns on those costs to manage operating expense growth and to budget future expenses furthermore because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance the measures adjusted sales and adjusted operating margin are metrics that factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year finally management uses the measures of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted
