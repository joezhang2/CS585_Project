hps consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a gaap basis hp provides operating profit operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash hp also provides forecasts of diluted earnings per share these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating profit is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is operating margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to diluted earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents reconciliations of each of these financial measures to gaap information are included in the tables and economic substance of financial measures used by operating profit and operating margin are defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges charges relating to the amortization of purchased intangible assets charges and research and development charges recorded during the relevant period net earnings and diluted earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges in addition net earnings and diluted earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each item hps management uses these financial measures for purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective financial performance as well as hps performance relative to its competitors hps management also uses these measures to further its own understanding of hps segment operating performance hp believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these financial measures allows hp management to better understand hps consolidated financial performance in relationship to the operating results of hps segments as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results more specifically hps management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons cash is a measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus investments and certain investments that may be liquidated within days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights hps management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in hps businesses funding strategic acquisitions repurchasing stock and other purposes hps management also uses gross cash for the purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective liquidity as well as to further its own understanding of hps segment operating results because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in gaap cash and cash equivalents hp believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hps liquidity and segment operating limitations associated with use of financial financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of hps results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these financial measures are for limitations associated with use of financial compensates for the limitations on its use of operating profit operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash by relying primarily on its gaap results and using financial measures only supplementally hp also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure within this press release and in other written materials that include these financial measures and hp encourages investors to review carefully those of financial measures to believes that providing operating profit operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash to investors in addition to the related gaap measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by hps management in its financial and operational and allows investors to see hps results through the eyes of management hp further believes that providing this information better enables hps investors to understand hps operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance disclosure of these financial measures also facilitates comparisons of hps operating performance with the performance of other companies in hps industry that supplement their gaap results with financial measures that are calculated in a similar a certain fiscal

these estimates to be meaningful these amounts could differ materially from actual reported amounts in hps form for the fiscal quarter ended july in particular determining hps actual tax balances and

operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash hp also provides forecasts of diluted earnings per share these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating profit is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is operating margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to diluted earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the ga ap measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents reconciliations of each of these financial measures to gaap information are included in the

earnings per share excluding those same charges in addition net earnings and diluted earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each item hps management uses these financial measures for purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective financial performance as well as hps performance relative to its competitors hps m anagement also uses these measures to further its own understanding of hps segment operating performance hp believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these financial measures allows hp management to better understand hps consolidated financial performance in relationship to the operating results of hps segments as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results more specifically hps management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons cash is a measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus investments and certain investments that may be liquidated within days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights hps management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in hps businesses funding strategic acquisitions repurchasing stock and other purposes hps management also uses gross cash for the purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective liquidity as well as to further its own understanding of hps segment operating results because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in gaap cash and cash equivalents hp believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hps liquidity and segment operating limitations associated with use of financial financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of hps results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these financial measures are for limitations associated with use of financial compensates for the limitations on its use of operating profit operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash by relying primarily on its gaap results and using financial measures only supplementally hp also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure within this press release and in other written materials that include these financial measures and hp encourages investors to review carefully those of financial measures to believes that providing operating profit operating margin net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash to investors in addition to the related gaap measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by hps management in its financial and operational and allows investors to see hps results through the eyes of management hp further believes that providing this information better enables hps investors to understand hps operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and

diluted earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each item hps management uses these financial measures for purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective financial performance as well as hps performance relative to its competitors hps management also uses these measures to further its own understanding of hps segment operating performance hp believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these financial measures allows hp management to better understand hps consolidated financial performance in

of those items mentioned above for the following reasons cash is a measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus investments and certain investments that may be liquidated within days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights hps management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in hps businesses funding

net earnings diluted earnings per share and gross cash to investors in addition to the related gaap measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by hps management in its financial and operational and allows investors to see hps results through the eyes of management hp further believes that providing this information better enables hps investors to understand hps operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance disclosure of these financial measures also facilitates comparisons of hps operating performance with the performance of other co mpanies in hps industry that supplement their gaap results with financial measures that are calculated in a

profit is earnings from operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is operating margin the gaap measure most directly comparable to net earnings is net earnings the gaap measure most directly comparable to diluted earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents reconciliations of

benefit associated with each item hps management uses these financial measures for purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective financial performance as well as hps performance relative to its competitors hps management also uses these measures to further its own understanding of hps segment operating performance hp believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these

the purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective liquidity as well as to further its own understanding of hps segment operating results because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in gaap cash and cash equivalents hp believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hps liquidity and segment operating limitations associated with use of financial financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of hps results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these financial measures are for limitations associated with use of financial compensates for the limitations on its use of operating profit operating margin net

hp further believes that providing this information better enables hps investors to understand hps operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by

comparable to diluted earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents the gaap measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations reconciliations of each of these financial measures to gaap information are included in the tables and economic substance of financial measures used by net revenue reflects the elimination of contra revenue associated with sales incentive programs implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of in connection with the wind down of hps webos device business net of webos device revenue for the period operating profit and operating margin are defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges charges relating to the

performance relative to its competitors hps management also uses these measures to further its own understanding of hps segment operating performance hp believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these financial measures allows hp management to better understand hps consolidated financial performance in relationship to the operating results of hps segments as management does not

that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus investments and certain investments that may be liquidated within days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures hps management uses gross cash and free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in hps businesses funding strategic acquisitions repurchasing stock and other purposes hps management also uses gross cash and free cash flow for the purposes of evaluating hps historical and prospective liquidity as well as to further its own understanding of hps segment operating results because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in gaap cash and cash equivalents hp believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hps liquidity and segment operating results because free cash flow includes the effect of capital expenditures that are not reflected in gaap cash flow from operations hp believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hps liquidity and capital limitations associated with use of financial
