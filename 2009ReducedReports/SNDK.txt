form factors using our flash memory controller and firmware technologies we source the vast majority of our flash memory supply through our significant venture relationships with toshiba which provide us with memory wafers our cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones digital cameras gaming devices and laptop computers we also produce usb drives players ssds and embedded flash storage results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices which in turn depends on demand for electronic products we believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic accordingly we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes units of memory and that over time new markets will emerge in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte and the average capacity of our products must grow enough to offset price declines we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of adopted statement of financial accounting standards no or sfas as of the beginning of fiscal year in february the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb staff position no fas which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually therefore we have only adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities sfas defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition see note investments and fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this value date of fasb statement no adopted statement of financial accounting standards no or sfas which permits entities to elect at specified election dates to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of december we did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities that were not previously measured at fair value see note investments and fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this the fair value option for financial assets and accounting policies discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including among others those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories and related reserves investments assets income taxes warranty obligations restructuring contingencies compensation and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources estimates have historically approximated actual results however future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and of estimates accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no or sfas we perform tests for impairment of assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that other assets may not be recoverable this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows we recorded impairments of certain amortizable intangible assets of million in fiscal year based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows in addition we recorded impairments of our investments in flash partners and flash alliance of million in fiscal year based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and certain external sources and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information if future forecasts are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charges we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those of assets intangible assets and for the impairment or disposal of perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more often if there are indicators of impairment present the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no or sfas require that a impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step or step we compare our fair value to our carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value then we must perform the second step or step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference to determine the fair value used in step we use our market capitalization based upon our quoted closing stock price per nasdaq including an estimated control premium that an investor would be willing to pay for a controlling interest in us the determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and transactions related synergies and other benefits when we are required to perform a step analysis determining the fair value of our net assets and our sheet intangibles used in step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we performed our annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the goodwill was not impaired however based on a combination of factors including the economic environment our current and forecasted operating results pricing conditions and a sustained decline in our market capitalization we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we recognized an impairment charge of and other intangible recognition sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete as evidenced by an agreement with the customer transfer of title and acceptance if applicable fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection right of return and therefore the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer or the rights of return expire at december and december deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million respectively estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings including price protection promotions advertising and other incentives and expected returns additionally we have incentive programs that require us to estimate based on historical experience the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues in calculating the value of sales incentive programs actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly data from our customers the timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues in addition actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates which could impact the revenue we and inventory valuation are stated at the lower of cost or market market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales industry trends existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors should actual market conditions differ from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally six to twelve months to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product and on noncancelable orders we could be required to record additional inventory reserves which would have a negative impact on our gross for variable interest entities evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the fasb interpretation no or fin if those entities are variable interest entities or vies we then determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to expected gains and losses the assessment of the primary beneficiary includes an analysis of the forecast and contractual stipulations of the vie determining whether we would consolidate or apply the equity method to a particular vie requires review of the vies forecast which involves analysis of company specific data industry data known trends and uncertainties which are inherently subjective consolidating a vie under fin rather than using the equity method can materially impact revenue gross margin and operating income for variable interest entities tax assets must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income estimates of future income and tax planning strategies we have incurred cumulative losses in recent years and determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on all available evidence that there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods and accordingly we recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our and certain foreign net deferred tax estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence complexity of the matter available federal tax case law interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future of decrease in our fiscal year product revenues compared to fiscal year reflected a reduction in average selling price per gigabyte partially offset by a increase in the number of gigabytes sold which reflected growth in memory product units sold and growth in average capacity the decline in retail product revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to aggressive price declines partially offset by a increase in gigabytes sold the decline in original equipment manufacturer or oem product revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to aggressive price declines partially offset by a increase in gigabytes sold and the discontinuation of twinsys data storage limited partnership or twinsys operations on march which contributed million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year prior to ceasing operations we believe the unit growth of in fiscal year was below the unit growth in fiscal year due primarily to deteriorating worldwide economic increase in our fiscal year product revenues was comprised of a increase in the number of gigabytes sold partially offset by a reduction in average selling price per gigabyte our unit sales increased compared to fiscal year with the strongest unit growth coming from cards for mobile phones oem revenue particularly benefited from higher sales of mobile cards and embedded products to mobile handset vendors retail revenue growth benefited from the growing market for cards for mobile phones as well as increased sales of usb flash product revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year decreased in all geographical regions due to aggressive industry price declines partially offset by unit sales growth in all regions except japan revenue and unit sales in japan declined on a year over year basis due to lower sales of oem usb drives and cards and the discontinuation of twinsys operations on march which contributed million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year prior to ceasing fiscal year revenue growth was strong in both apac and emea primarily as a result of increased sales to oem mobile handset vendors and the growth of mobile card and usb sales in international retail channels japan revenue increased from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily as a result of product revenue from our msystems acquisition in november unit sales in the increased over fiscal year however total revenues in the were lower by due primarily to aggressive price reductions in fiscal year and royalty increase in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues was primarily due to the addition of new increase in our fiscal year license and royalty revenues was primarily due to new license agreements as well as increased sales by our existing gross margins in fiscal year decreased percentage points compared to fiscal year primarily due to aggressive industry price declines resulting in the sale of products at negative gross margins and related charges the related charges in fiscal year included reserves primarily to reduce the carrying value to the for both inventory and in the channel of of million for adverse purchase commitments associated with of flash ventures capacity for the period in which we have in our investments in flash partners and flash alliance of expense of intangible assets is expected to decline in fiscal year primarily due to impairments recorded in fiscal year fiscal years and we sold million million and million respectively of inventory that had been fully in previous gross margins in fiscal year decreased percentage points compared to fiscal year due to excess industry supply which led to price per megabyte declining faster than cost per megabyte and also led to inventory charges gross margin was also negatively impacted by charges for excess inventory of certain products and flash alliance venture costs partially offset by insurance proceeds related to claims on a fab power outage that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year in addition cost of product increased due to amortization of intangible assets of million which accounted for approximately percentage and fiscal year research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses and expenses of approximately million an increase in consulting and material and equipment costs of million partially offset by lower compensation expense of million and lower flash venture related costs of million the growth in fiscal year research and development expense reflects parallel investment in nand and storage technologies and memory architecture fiscal year research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll and expenses of million associated with headcount growth and our acquisition of msystems higher consultant and outside service costs of million higher engineering and material costs of million and compensation expense of million related to increased headcount in addition in fiscal year we recognized flash alliance costs of and fiscal year sales and marketing expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year was primarily due to increased branding and merchandising costs of million and increased costs of million partially offset by lower compensation expense of million the growth in branding and merchandising and costs primarily reflected expansion of our international sales channels due to our restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will be lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year for further discussion see restructuring charges and other fiscal year sales and marketing expense growth included increased advertising and promotional costs on a worldwide basis of approximately million in addition payroll and expenses increased million and compensation expense increased million both related to increased headcount and our acquisition of msystems in november and fiscal year general and administrative expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year was primarily related to increased legal and outside advisor costs of million and bad debt expense of million partially offset by lower compensation costs of million and payroll and costs of million our legal and outside advisor costs increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased patent and litigation expenses as well as expenses incurred in connection with strategic initiatives due to our restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect that our general and administrative payroll and expenses will be lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year for further discussion see restructuring charges and other fiscal year general and administrative expense increases were primarily related to increased payroll expenses and compensation expense associated with headcount increases including our acquisition of msystems in november of accordance with sfas goodwill is not amortized but instead is reviewed and tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired we performed our annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the goodwill was not impaired however based on a combination of factors including the economic environment current and forecasted operating results pricing conditions and a sustained decline in our market capitalization we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we recognized an impairment charge of of intangible accordance with sfas we recorded a million impairment on intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this impairment was based upon forecasted discounted cash flows which considered factors including a reduced business outlook primarily due to pricing of intangible of intangible assets in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was lower due to intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal year our expense from the amortization of intangible assets was primarily related to our acquisitions of matrix in january and msystems in november amortization expense of intangible assets is expected to decline in fiscal year primarily due to impairments recorded in fiscal year increase of amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended december was directly related to twelve months of amortization in fiscal year from our acquisition of msystems compared to less than two months of amortization in fiscal year of acquired part of the matrix acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year and the msystems acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year a portion of each purchase price was allocated to acquired technology which was determined through established valuation techniques in the industry and at the date of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed the value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values as of december we estimated that the remaining projects related to the msystems acquisition would be completed over the next two quarters at an estimated total cost of million as of december all projects related to the matrix acquisition were charges and fiscal years and we implemented several restructuring plans which included reductions of our workforce and consolidation of operations we recorded restructuring charges and other of million and million in fiscal years and respectively the goal of these restructuring and other charges was to bring our operational expenses to appropriate levels relative to our net revenues while simultaneously implementing extensive programs all expenses including adjustments associated with our restructuring plans are included in restructuring charges and other in the consolidated statements of operations for further discussion of our restructuring plans refer to note restructuring plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this restructuring and recorded restructuring and other charges of million for plans implemented in fiscal year of these charges million related to severance and benefits for employee reductions worldwide and million related to marketing contract termination costs technology license impairments and fixed asset impairments related to outsourcing certain manufacturing activities in addition restructuring and other charges include an accrual for unrelated litigation expect to reduce our annual cost and operating expenses by approximately million as a result of our fiscal year restructuring plans approximately and of the restructuring cost savings related to the fiscal year restructuring plans are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenues research and development expense sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense the first quarter of fiscal year management approved and initiated plans to bring our operational expenses to appropriate levels relative to our net revenues while simultaneously implementing extensive programs this restructuring plan eliminated certain duplicative assets and resources in all functions of the organization worldwide due to consolidating certain processes in order to reduce our cost structure which resulted in a charge of million in fiscal year fiscal year other income decrease compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower interest income in fiscal year reflecting reduced interest rates and lower cash and investment balances impairment of our equity investment in tower of million and an impairment of our investment in flashvision of fiscal year other income was lower than fiscal year primarily due to a full year interest and amortization of bond discount expense of million resulting from our billion debt offering in may and the acquired msystems million debt and an impairment charge of million to the of our flashvision investment included in income loss in equity investments offset by increased interest income due to higher cash for income fiscal year provision for income taxes was an expense of million with a negative effective tax rate of this is primarily due to the of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain and foreign gross deferred tax assets the valuation allowance was due primarily to the size of the fiscal year net loss and that it is not more likely than not that certain and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future fiscal year had a provision for income taxes of million and an effective tax rate of which was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to compensation expenses and certain foreign losses partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at other than rates and fiscal year effective tax rate decreased from fiscal year primarily due to the fiscal year of acquired technology and higher interest income in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by foreign losses not benefited and compensation reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to fasb interpretation no increased by million and million in fiscal years and for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no and capital cash flows were as follows flows provided by operating activities is generated by net income loss adjusted for certain items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operations of million for fiscal year the decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from our net loss of billion offset by impairments cash flow from accounts receivable in fiscal year was positively impacted by increased collection efforts and by reduced product accounts receivable levels as compared with the prior year period the increase in inventory was related primarily to the expansion of capacity and production at flash alliance and flash partners while revenue from our products declined from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in other assets was due to the increase in tax receivables related to tax refunds expected on carryback claims due to the fiscal year net loss within operating activities for fiscal year there was an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in related parties payables due to timing of flash ventures payments at fiscal year year end an increase in other liabilities related to flash ventures capacity under utilization accrual timing of the cash settlement of outstanding hedge contracts and lower deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers related to lower revenue activities activities generated million of cash during the fiscal year ended december the primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended december were net income adjusted to exclude the effect of charges including depreciation amortization compensation loss on equity investments and deferred taxes and changes in balance sheet accounts including a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable trade and accounts payable to related parties which were partially offset by increases in inventory and other assets and a decrease in other cash provided from investing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of billion in fiscal year the increase in cash provided from investing was primarily related to reduced purchases of short and investments due to our higher liquidity requirements and the return of million on our investment in flashvision and million from the sale of fab equipment that we owned directly as compared to the return of million from flashvision in the fiscal year usage of cash for investments in and loans to flash partners and flash alliance was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year used billion for investing activities during the fiscal year ended december purchases of short and investments net of from sales and maturities of investments totaled million capital expenditures for the year were million and investments and notes flash partners and flash million net of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million as compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal year was primarily related to lower cash proceeds from employee stock programs and repayment of debt financing in fiscal year offset by the termination of the share repurchase programs which used cash in fiscal year used million of cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended december comprised primarily of million to purchase treasury shares pursuant to our share repurchase program partially offset by cash received from exercises of awards of million additionally during the fiscal year ended december we received a tax benefit of million on employee stock december we had cash cash equivalents and investments of billion we have billion of investments which we believe are also liquid assets but are classified as investments due to the remaining maturity of the investment being greater than one assets of december our working capital balance was billion we expect our loans to and investments in flash ventures as well as our investments in property plant and equipment to be approximately billion in fiscal year liquidity liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding flash ventures master lease agreements the flash ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor including among other things our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least billion and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of from standard poors or s p or moodys corporation or a minimum corporate rating of from rating investment information or r i as of december flash ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants while our s p credit rating was b two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from s p our r i credit rating was one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from r february r i confirmed our credit rating at with a change in outlook from stable to negative if r i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold flash ventures would become with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us as guarantor or increased interest rates or waiver fees should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances if a resolution was unsuccessful we could be required to pay a portion or the entire outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantee under such flash ventures master lease agreements of up to billion based upon the exchange rate at december which could negatively impact our on the demand for our products we may decide to make additional investments which could be substantial in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions these activities may require us to raise additional financing which could be difficult to obtain and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts could prevent us from funding flash ventures increasing our wafer supply developing or enhancing our products taking advantage of future opportunities engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes any of which could harm our requirements december we had billion of aggregate principal amount in convertible notes outstanding consisting of billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due our convertible notes due may be redeemed in whole or in part by the holders thereof at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on march and various dates arrangements with the issuance of the senior convertible notes due we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share as of december the warrants had an expected life of approximately years and expire in august at expiration we may at our option elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis as of december the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding in addition counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due in full at a conversion price of per share the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the senior convertible notes due or the first day that none of the senior convertible notes due remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the senior convertible notes due as of december we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement see note financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this are a owner in both flash partners and flash alliance or hereinafter referred to as flash ventures our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshibas yokkaichi japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash ventures this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba flash ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures nand wafer supply or to pay for of the fixed costs of flash ventures we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers see note related parties and strategic investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this partners and flash alliance ventures with toshiba cost of the wafers we purchase from flash ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues flash ventures are variable interest entities however we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture accordingly we account for our investments under the equity method and do not flash ventures agreements we agreed to share in toshibas costs associated with nand product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities as of december we had accrued liabilities related to those common research and development expenses of million our common research and development obligation related to flash ventures is variable based on an annual forecasted joint research and development costs as mutually agreed upon by us and toshiba in addition to general nand product development and common semiconductor research performed by toshiba both parties perform direct research and development activities specific to flash ventures and our contribution is based on a variable computation we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flash ventures we toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis of the outstanding flash ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from december through december these master lease obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable our total master lease obligation guarantee net of lease payments as of december was billion japanese yen or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at december we and toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of flash ventures that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding as of december flash partners fab had reached full capacity of approximately wafers per month however we expect to continue to invest in flash partners in order to convert to future technology nodes the capacity of flash alliances fab at full expansion is expected to be approximately wafers per month and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed upon by both parties in during the remainder of fiscal year we expect to invest approximately million in flash ventures primarily for future technology nodes which we expect will be funded through additional investments and loans to flash ventures and working capital contributions from flash was ramped than of this estimated full we are currently not investing in further capacity expansion of fab as weak macroeconomic conditions coupled with the growth of our nand supply base have resulted in us carrying excess january we entered into definitive agreements with toshiba under which we and toshiba agreed to restructure flash partners and flash alliance to provide for the acquisition by toshiba of certain production capacity in connection with the production of nand flash memory products at the facilities more than of its current production capacity through the acquisition by toshiba of certain owned and leased equipment the total value of the restructuring transaction to us is approximately million based upon the exchange rate as of january approximately of this value will be in cash paid to us and approximately of this value represents a transfer of lease obligations to toshiba which should reduce our outstanding lease obligations and associated lease guarantees by approximately these transactions are expected to occur at several closings between january and march subject to certain closing conditions and terms and conditions under flash agreed to the second quarter of fiscal year we and toshiba determined that production of nand flash memory products utilizing wafers was no longer cost effective relative to market prices for nand flash memory and decided to the flashvision venture as part of the ongoing of flashvision toshiba purchased certain assets of flashvision the existing master equipment lease agreement between flashvision and a consortium of financial institutions has been retired thereby releasing us from our contingent indemnification obligation with toshiba due to the qualifying as a reconsideration event under fin we and concluded that flashvision is no longer a variable interest entity within the scope of fin in fiscal year we received distributions of million relating to our investment in flashvision we took impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million in the third quarter of fiscal year due to flashvisions difficulty in selling the remaining excess capital equipment due to deteriorating market conditions for equipment related to the production of flash memory products at december we had a net investment in flashvision of million denominated in japanese yen offset by million of cumulative translation adjustments

those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in note commitments contingencies and guarantees of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this of currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our nand flash wafers in addition we also have significant costs denominated in the chinese renminbi or rmb and the israeli new shekel or ils we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes in fiscal years and we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the dollar in addition in fiscal year we used foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future japanese yen costs for nand flash wafers our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final

memory products for the parties toshiba will own and fund the construction of the fab building which will be located in yokkaichi japan adjacent to the site of the parties current flash partners and flash alliance ventures both parties will initially share in the cost of the manufactu ring equipment as well as startup costs which costs are expected to be substantial and depreciation of the fab building will be a component of the cost per wafer charged to each party with the creation of the new venture sandisk and toshiba are further expanding their long business relationship in and again in

venture the phase building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin first output from phase is expected in the third quarter of calendar year sandisk expects that fab will increase its wafer output by less than sandisk is committed to of the initial ramp within phase of fab and this initial commitment is expected to result in equipment investments and costs of approximately million through there will be no material impact on sandisks capital investments sandisk will also provide a cash prepayment of approximately million in to be credited against future charges no commitments or timelines have been finalized for any further phase capacity expansions or for the construction of phase for expansion

of its participation in any fab capacity expansion and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportional level of equipment funding as long as sandisk maintains a relatively low threshold of the fab capacity sandisk will benefit from equal wafer costs with toshiba if sandisk falls below that threshold of the fab capacity sandisk would be responsible for a

either i purchase sandisks full interest in fab immediately under a certain pricing methodology in which case sandisk has the right to purchase continued wafer supply for a limited period of time
