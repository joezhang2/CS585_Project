strong quarter at the bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up over percent year to was driven by terrific margin performance with margin up points year to business technology services was up over points business services was up points to a record level software was up over was on software revenue growth of percent at constant currency driven by sales execution and growth in mission critical production services signed billion at actual rates within that strategic outsourcing signings were up percent with north america up we had solid signings in global business services up percent at constant currency we had good cash performance and ended the year in a very strong financial quarter wrapped up an exceptional year in which we delivered record revenue of over billion record profit of billion record earnings per share of and record free cash flow of billion up almost billion year to year that a lot of software profit grew percent year to year while we successfully integrated cognos and services we generated percent profit growth and signed over billion of new business i say that again in hardware we had a successful of our mainframe which was up percent for the overall no two ways about it this was a very strong year for building off of this base we expect to deliver at least of earnings per share in before moving on to the details of the quarter i want to take a step back and talk about what driving our performance over the last several demonstration of ibm you know since the last time we entered a recession we have been executing a strategy that is transforming our innovation and global integration at the core of this change we are a shift to higher value businesses for growth in the emerging markets solutions that address clients needs in any environment improving efficiency which drives higher profit results over the past several years are clear and have added over billion to our profit base margin more than doubled per share more than tripled cumulatively we generated about billion of free cash that a lot of let look at how those results were generated over time financial performance at ibm performance over the last several years you see that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since that was a low point where you can clearly see the impact of the last recession and the resulting actions we took that year so what different now the it space that recession was more about overcapacity which is not the case today and the it industry in general is much different more importantly ibm is a fundamentally different company today we have much less dependence on the cyclical and commoditizing products that are most affected in a services we have a much more flexible labor model that can adapt to changing market environments and much of our software is embedded in the fabric of our clients it combination of the mix of our overall business and the mix of products and services within those businesses puts us in a much stronger position than we had going into have implemented a tremendous amount of change this decade we are globally integrating the company we are investing to capture the opportunity in growth exited commoditizing businesses including hdds in pcs in and printers in which represents nearly billion of annual includes the acquisition of pwc consulting in which gave us breed process and industry skills that are critical to delivering high value services to clients and set the stage for the performance you saw this year in that same time we acquired over companies for a total of about acquisitions such as cognos telelogic and ascential have extended our middleware capabilities and solidified our position as the leading middleware also invested over billion in research and development to strengthen our technology consecutive year we were no in patents with over in that more than the total of microsoft hp and cisco combined consistent with the direction of our business over percent of our patents were for software and one measure of this leadership last week we announced that for the we also announced a new initiative designed to further leverage our technology leadership by significantly increasing the number of technical inventions we publish making those inventions freely available to others and spurring innovation especially in support of the of newer smarter can see this transformation reflected in the profit mix of our business over impact on segment profit our profit was billion and over percent of our segment profit came from software services and can see that percent of our profit came from our software business and percent from services while hardware contributed just if you exclude the amortization of intangibles and the benefit from our pension in software increases to really illustrates how our business has changed over time as a result of our significant portfolio actions and targeted investment strategies as we shift to where we see the best long term i turn to the detailed financial results for the financial at our income statement for the quarter our revenue was billion down percent as reported and percent at constant had outstanding margin performance gross margin expanded points led by services and with focused expense management we grew income percent over last year and pti margin expanded income grew percent and margin expanded to a lower tax rate year to year primarily driven by utilization of tax credits bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up percent year to quarter our liquidity position remains balance sheet and capital structure are also on very solid ground we finished the quarter with almost billion of cash on hand and we had continued good performance in the capital markets in the we delivered billion of revenue earnings of billion and earnings per share of all record expanded margins with gross and net margin all up over a point we generated over billion of free cash flow and returned over billion to shareholders through share repurchases and me tell you how we been able to achieve these results in a tough had relatively stable revenue performance by delivering what customers need in this for the customers that are trying to save cost and conserve capital we can adapt our offerings to help them do that as a proof point of our billion of signings in gbs about of the signings delivered cost reduction to our our growth markets unit where growth is driven by infrastructure we aggressively invested to capture that the year our constant currency revenue growth in these markets was points higher than in the major markets and by building on our long term relationships with clients we generate about half of our revenue in annuity businesses which provides a solid base of revenue and gross margin expansion was driven by a combination of three elements mixing to higher value businesses pricing for value and our focus on cost in expense we focused on driving productivity in sales development and our global support quarter details starting with revenue by let me get into the by total geographic revenue was down percent as reported and flat at constant currency with mixed performance by always i focus my comments on the constant currency had the strongest performance up percent while europe and asia pacific were down the major markets declined percent though we had some countries that performed very well germany had the fastest growth of the countries with percent growth canada grew percent while the uk grew percent and france grew percent the was flat and japan and italy from these markets represented percent of ibm geographic revenue in the quarter and the in the emerging markets our growth markets organization grew been investing to capture opportunities to build out public and private quarter we also saw customers in these markets focus on cost savings a reflection of the global economic environment we obviously very to address these bric countries a subset of our growth markets grew percent with strong growth in brazil and quarter however russia declined as it was significantly impacted by credit limitations but while russia was weak other countries like chile and egypt had very strong was up percent an improvement from the continue to shift resources to where we see the best opportunities to ensure we positioned to capture the by key industry sales to our industry view revenue was down percent or flat at constant comment on a few of the sector was the fastest growing sector again this quarter with strength in government and with education returning to growth at constant the growth markets specifically our clients are investing in education as a way to develop national skill addition to solid revenue growth we also had good signings in the public sector up percent worldwide and over percent in the overall performance was the industrial sector as concerns with the credit markets and margin pressures consecutive financial services declined percent at constant currency in line with ibm overall performance for the clients remain focused on cost reduction risk management and integration from our small and medium business clients declined percent at constant currency however services signings were up percent globally with signings up almost now let look at our revenue by by revenue performance was impacted by currency and the economic environment but also reflects our broad business capabilities and the contribution of our annuity was the fastest growing segment as our customers continue to utilize ibm infrastructure software in their production environments to optimize their revenue was driven by a strong annuity base and full year growth in short term and technology declined this quarter reflecting growth in high end servers offset by a decline in our and storage global financing financing revenue was up percent though this was more than offset by a decline in the sales of used the really impressive story within our segments is margin so let take a look at our progress in driving quarter our total expense and other income was down points of the decline was due to currency both translation of based expenses and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to estimate that acquisitions contributed about points of operational expense actually improved by points year to underneath this we executing our investment strategy and allocating our spending to areas where we see the best opportunity in our growth markets where we investing to capture this rapidly growing opportunity sg a excluding currency and acquisitions was up percent while in the rest of the world it was down percent reflecting our focus to drive productivity in our major markets our emphasis is not just on expense but on our entire spending base of almost billion and you see the benefit of these operational actions in our will continue our focus on structural changes that reduce our spending levels and improve productivity in me give you an example of the types of things that will contribute to ongoing margin an example we announced the outsourcing of our internal logistics process to geodis this enables us to take advantage of skill and scale and ultimately improve our productivity in the supply chain in addition to the ongoing savings we have an gain when we close the transaction in the first we tackling our globally integrated processes applying the same capabilities we sell to our customers to improve efficiency and drive cost we continue to drive cost out of services delivery through implementation of lean processes tools automation and standardization and growth in our global delivery finally we continue to redeploy skills to areas of growth moving more and more skills out of support and headquarters functions out to the want to comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this i show our margins by segment plans generated about million of cost and expense in the quarter this is a decrease of about million year to million of the improvement was a gain resulting from changes to the japan plan described last offset by quarter workforce actions in we indicated in october this the full year plans cost about billion this is better by about billion year to year or billion excluding the japan gain as a reference point at the beginning of the year we expected improvement of million to me comment on the performance of our pension the plan return on assets was down percent for the year while this is below our expected return it is considerably better than the s p performance which was down percent our plans which comprise about percent of our assets in aggregate were down globally our pension plans were down percent for the forward we will hold our expected return assumption at percent and we will take our discount rate down to percent reflecting the current interest rate with these assumptions together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions we expect cost and expense of about billion consistent with our cost and expense levels excluding the japan a funding perspective we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plans of about billion our plan is percent funded and globally our qualified plans are about percent to workforce rebalancing quarter our workforce reduction charges were up about million year to year an impact of cents per share this includes about million for the activity in the remainder of the expenses reflects the ongoing skills rebalancing that is a regular element of our business couple other items that i mention other income and expense interest income was down million reflecting the current interest rate impact of these hedging programs is reflected principally in other income and expense and cost of goods negatively impacted our results partially offset by our hedgingprograms we hedge the major cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility as we manage our cash globally quarter our hedging instruments flipped from a loss to a gain resulting in a benefit of about million in other income and the full year our tax rate was percent this lower rate reflects improved foreign tax credit utilization and the retroactive reinstatement of the research tax tax rate was percent in the quarter down from the previous ongoing rate of percent which contributed cents of earnings per share in the of these benefits will be sustained and we expect a rate of about percent in fairly consistent on by before getting into the segments i quickly show you our margin performance by margins reflect the shift of our business to higher value areas and our constant focus on improving quarter margin improvement also reflects lower total managed labor costs year to year across all elements however on a full year basis total managed labor costs were up percent year to year across all elements excluding all contributed to great margin performance in our services segments software and financing while hardware now i turn to our segment performance starting with services two global services segments delivered very strong margin and profit performance this combined revenue that was down percent as reported and up percent at constant currency our services business delivered a record level of profit and margin of percent which is up points year to performed exceptionally well in the current economic climate through disciplined execution on resource optimization and improved operating efficiencies while at the same time delivering services with a very high level of quality and customer were billion at actual rates down percent and up percent at constant quarter last year overall short term signings were down percent at actual rates and down percent at constant currency while long term signings were down percent at actual rates and up percent at constant signed billion in deals this quarter coming off a very strong signed deals larger than million and that the highest number we seen in quite some at the end of the year was an estimated billion up billion quarter to that overview of the total services business i highlight the key drivers of performance in the two services services revenue was down percent as reported and up percent at constant outsourcing our largest services business and the industry leader was down percent as reported and up percent at constant really had a very strong quarter in so signings up percent at constant currency north america was up percent with the up percent and europe was up percent this was really terrific performance across these strategic outsourcing offerings provide a compelling value proposition in this environment in particular our clients in the major markets are turning to outsourcing as an effective way to quickly meet their financial seeing some very impressive performance in this initiatives around standardization global integration and improved efficiency are not just driving margin improvement they also resulting in improved quality and customer sat our metrics in both of these areas are at some of the highest levels we ever able to drive continuous efficiency and productivity improvements while satisfying our clients is the cornerstone of this business and is ultimately reflected in our ability to attract new business you saw the results this quarter in our signings technology services revenue was flat as reported and up percent at constant signings were down this quarter we continue to see good results in our key infrastructure percent up points year to technology services profitwas up percent and was the sixth consecutive quarter of pre tax profit growth and we had gross margin expansion in all lines of continues to execute on the bottom line driven by a delivery structure that maximizes utilization and flexibility a mix to higher value offerings lower total managed labor costs and a global skills mix that enables us to rapidly put our people where the work great example of this was announced just last opening a new technology services delivery center in dubuque iowa this center will primarily support ibm strategic outsourcing clients where we will manage ibm servers and storage systems which are critical for assuring optimal it infrastructure performance this center meets our clients need for data center services and gives ibm access to key to global business services revenue was down percent as reported and flat at constant savings offerings continue to drive the majority of business although we seeing some increased demand for transformational offerings and compliance although market conditions remain tough and clients remain cautious cost savings offerings continue to percent at constant term signings were billion down percent at actual rates and i mentioned earlier cost savings accounted for about of the new deals sector financial services posted the strongest growth up percent with banking up percent public sector communications and general business all grew signings double digits while industrial and distribution logically showed steep term signings were down percent at actual rates and percent at constant sector was a bright spot with public sector signings up over recently announced the creation of a delivery center for application services located at michigan state is a first of a kind center that will provide innovative application development and support services to modernize older and less efficient it systems for state and local government agencies and universities certainly a timely business services delivered a record level of profit again this profit was up percent and margin expanded points to percent the best has consistently executed with strong profit growth represents the third straight year of profit growth greater than demonstrates strong operating discipline the benefits of a globally integrated operating model stable pricing and lower managed labor despite slower revenue growth utilization actually improved year to year which is a function of resource optimization and the balancing of our domestic global and subcontracted we continue to be very selective and structured in our deals we not just driving signings anyone can do that we driving for a long term profitable relationship for both ibm and our revenue of billion was up to or percent at constant middleware was percent of our total software portfolio and grew to or percent at constant had a very strong pipeline going into the quarter and our sales team showed solid execution in a difficult the quarter websphere information management lotus and tivoli software sold of our largest customers signed deals with us demonstrating continued commitment to ibm technology these customers value the depth and breadth of our product portfolio and support americas had a particularly strong quarter up percent or percent at constant currency with good growth in both large and small deals up percent and percent me give you some insight into our branded middleware management software grew percent or percent at constant currency information management grew organically and cognos also had a terrific the launch of our information on demand initiative in early information management software has grown at a compounded rate of percent over the last relational database has grown at percent over the same period in the quarter alone our distributed relational database grew over percent at constant software was down percent and up percent at constant december we completed the acquisition of ilog which helps customers improve business decisions with optimization visualization and business rules was flat at actual rates and up percent at constant currency capitalizing on the strong performance of our collaboration software was down percent but was up percent at constant software provides the advanced capabilities required to run large environments this includes systems management security and storage software which helps customers improve utilization and reduce was down percent at actual rates but grew percent at constant currency versus a difficult constant currency growth was fueled by the telelogic software segment income grew to billion the large annuity base in our software business continues to provide a predictable and growing stream of profit and cash for been investing heavily in our software business for some time with good revenue in was over billion and in the last five years profits have more than doubled to and technology of billion was down percent year to year or percent at constant system z and converged system p servers did well but our platform this tough customers are focused on reducing the cost of running their it which provides the ability to run multiple workloads on a server is a key enabler of z is the ultimate platform for virtualization able to support thousands of images and run fully power architecture supports hundreds of partitions often driving utilization rates of over of these platforms leverage the entire system from their custom semiconductors right through the software stack to achieve these high levels of efficiency and lower cost of contrast the distributed computing model with many small servers and typical utilization rates of less than percent simply can not offer the same level of efficiency and let turn our focus to the declined percent year to year but was up percent at constant currency mips grew is the fourth consecutive quarter of mips growth mips from specialty engines were up percent driven by new workloads on the had very strong growth in the americas revenue was up sector financial services and industrial sectors were particularly system percent revenue growth or percent at constant is the tenth consecutive quarter of year to year revenue growth the energy efficiency and system capabilities of technology continues to resonate with customers coupled with exceptional performance is the right solution for a multitude of result is strong performance in both and servers both growing percent at constant revenue declined percent year to was down percent and tape declined revenue declined to with blades down reflects a significant slowdown in the market as customers are virtualizing and consolidating workloads into more efficient platforms such as power and as you look at these results you can see that the industry standard hardware is clearly more susceptible to an economic flow to ibm cash performance we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter up million year to the year our free cash flow was up billion to improvement was driven by growth in net income and tight controls on capital spending our collection performance for the quarter and the year was very ability to consistently generate a high level of free cash flow positions us well for i look at the uses of cash for the year have funded net capital investment of about billion and invested billion in acquisitions this is the highest level of acquisition spending in ibm also returned billion to billion of this was through we bought back million shares for billion including million this put our spend in perspective on a net share repurchase basis which includes the impact of employee stock purchases we returned billion to shareholders which is consistent with our and spend at the end of the year we had billion remaining from our last board to the balance sheet we finished with a strong cash balance of nearly billion up billion from experience in the capital markets in the quarter was very raised billion of term financing and while our experience in the commercial paper market remains unchanged we reduced our cp balance by paying off of the billion that was outstanding at the end of september so we finished with less than million of outstanding cp at the end of the addition we retired billion of debt from our are for with our strong cash balance cp flexibility billion global credit facility and our positive experience in the capital to debt our total debt of almost billion is down billion year to year and down million in the the billion billion supports our global financing segment leveraged at to our global financing business percent of this portfolio is investment grade as you can see in the supplemental charts ninety seven percent of this portfolio is in our core competency of technology equipment and solution are no exotic assets and as you would expect no consumer or mortgage finally while our reserves have increased consistent with the economic environment this business still provides a very strong percent return on remaining debt the debt was billion down billion year to debt is supported by our cash balances of billion and our annual free cash flows which were over billion in i am very comfortable with this level of debt relative to those repayment increased to percent reflecting an equity reduction of over billion due to lower returns on our pension in turn reduced total stockholders equity to billion by year this impact on book equity is and does not affect our borrowing capacity or our eps let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the drivers of our percent earnings per share revenue declined percent including points of currency impact at constant mix and margin this percent decline reduced eps growth by once again by far the biggest driver of our earnings growth was gross margin expansion led by higher margins in services and software and a mix to higher margin margin improvement contributed cents of eps growth in the productivity impacted eps growth by cents driven by that we absorbed a cent impact from lower tax rate contributed cents to eps we had cents from share you look at this chart it clear that the growth came from margin expansion the result of an improved business mix and an ongoing focus on increasing operational see the same holds for the full eps at the bridge we had contribution from several similar to the quarter performance you can see the largest contribution came from margin expansion driven by improved mix a shift to higher value businesses and a focus on cost management and improved let me wrap positioned in current maintain leadership in the it industry you need to continue to innovate integrate and reinvent the last several years we have been executing a strategy to transform our business shifting to higher value services and software with less dependence on commoditizing and cyclical hardware the value has shifted to the high end to address clients needs to consolidate and virtualize their services business now contributes percent of ibm segment profit and over percent of ibm resources it also a fundamentally different business more flexible and more focused on higher value software capabilities have grown through internal investment and acquisition and in the last five years our software profit has more than doubled to over over percent of our segment profit came from services and software and over percent was from services software and we have changed the profile of the business to make it more adaptable with offerings that allow us to succeed in a variety of different are entering the current market from a position of strength we will take advantage of the environment to continue to execute our strategies and make ourselves even i mentioned earlier we continue to invest to capture new infrastructure spending in emerging some of these economies have slowed they still offer good growth opportunity relative to the rest of the moved quickly to develop strong value propositions for our established markets based on cost reduction capital conservation and risk management our high value integrated offerings like green data centers outsourcing and virtualization on high end systems have performed well in this environment you can see that even in tough sectors like financial finally we see a real opportunity in smart infrastructure as governments around the world launch massive stimulus

achieve our objective of at least of earnings per share for the generated billion of free cash flow up ended the quarter with over billion of cash on hand and we reduced total debt by returned another billion to shareholders with million in dividends and billion of share done a lot of work over the last decade to transform the company shifting to higher value areas globalizing our business and constantly working to improve efficiency i give you a few examples of how the changes we made have positioned us to deliver this performance in a challenging economic with a focus on higher value offerings and strong services capabilities we can adapt our offerings to deliver what clients are looking for today clients remained focused on trying to save cost and conserve capital our services signings reflect our ability to meet these signings were up percent at constant currency with percent constant currency growth in our the actions we taken have dramatically shifted the mix of our business and our profit model has less dependence on hardware which is more vulnerable to economic conditions in fact this quarter effectively all of our profit came from software services and financing the annuity nature of these businesses provides a solid base of revenue profit and we have been investing to capture the opportunity in the growth markets our constant currency revenue growth in these markets remained about points higher than in the major we had an ongoing focus on driving productivity in all parts of the business from sales efficiency to supply chain management to service delivery to global support functions the result of this work is to reduce our fixed cost base and therefore improve the operational balance line we have built a more resilient business model and one that generates more profit from each dollar of us well for but more importantly our model provides the cash we need to invest in new areas that will help drive the next growth cycle for our clients in addition to our growth markets investments we have three other key is our smarter planet strategy where governments utilities and businesses are applying intelligence to the key processes of the world this allows clients to create more value and long term economic growth from their infrastructure second new opportunity is business analytics which leverages our broad capabilities to optimize our clients business performance by applying analytics to their business processes we already working on advanced analytics projects with a diverse set of clients including td bank mtn south africa the new york state department of tax and the sentinel third is cloud computing an emerging model for delivering and consuming of these three opportunities requires enterprise software deep industry process knowledge and solution integration capabilities where ibm is very we will leverage our cash position to be opportunistic to accelerate our progress in the areas we believe will fuel growth and competitive differentiation in the spend more time on these initiatives in our investor briefing in the middle of may but for now i get back to our first quarter at our income statement for the quarter our revenue was billion down percent as reported and percent at constant i mentioned we had outstanding margin margin expanded almost points driven by improving margin in services and software and the mix to higher value businesses such as expense was better by percent with continued focus on expense management and the benefit from a stronger margin expanded points and net income margin expanded finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up percent year to let me get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by by revenue performance was impacted by currency and the economic environment but also reflects our broad business capabilities and the contribution of our annuity revenue was driven by a strong annuity base though it was impacted by a slowdown in small faster yielding projects and declines in signings in revenue growth was driven by demand for mission critical and technology performance reflects the challenges that business are facing today within the segment our unix servers performed in global financing excluding currency impacts both financing revenue and the sales of used equipment were essentially by total geographic revenue was down percent as reported and percent at constant currency with consistent performance across the always i focus my comments on the constant currency the major markets declined percent our growth markets unit grew points faster up percent and we continue to outperform in these from the growth markets represented percent of ibm geographic revenue in the quarter as these countries build out their public and private infrastructures in this environment they also focused on cost been delivering these capabilities to clients in the major markets and so we are to address these growth markets performance reflects the diversity of the some of these areas are clearly more challenging like central and eastern europe and a few of the smaller asia pacific countries several of the larger countries are showing resiliency and good growth for example india grew percent and china grew india we again were named the it service provider in the domestic china in addition to continued strong demand for our banking infrastructure offerings our smarter planet solutions are gaining traction with all of the growth markets we continue to target our investments to profitable growth areas and capture opportunities in these strategically important by key industry sales you look at revenue performance by sector i think you find it is what you expect in the current sector was the fastest growing sector again this quarter with growth at constant currency in all addition to solid revenue growth we also had good signings in the public sector up almost percent worldwide at constant currency and over percent in the and education clients at the federal level are focusing on investments to drive job creation while state and local agencies are looking for cost reduction through infrastructure and process clients are focused on cost reductions with strong demand for outsourcing and transformational i briefly comment on the other financial services clients ibm value proposition around cost reduction and risk and compliance remain priorities and market consolidation is driving demand for integration communications clients are also looking for operating efficiencies and cost reduction and ibm offerings on intelligent utility network put ibm in a leadership position for smart grid distribution sector remains challenging in the major markets in the growth markets we have strong growth at constant currency in all industries as infrastructure for expansion drives sector remains the most challenging in all industries as these clients are conserving cash and reducing capital spending to position for recovery and drive long term i move on to a discussion on quarter our total expense and other income was down drove points of decline year to year and reflects both translation of based expenses and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to estimate that acquisitions contributed about points of our operational expense improved points year to been executing an operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity across the the last several quarters i highlighted a number of initiatives we working on to reduce our structure and make it more variable this lower level of fixed cost improves our balance point so every dollar of revenue yields more profit the changes we made allowed us to deliver margin improvement this quarter in a tough we also see additional benefit as we go forward as our current actions start to comment on three actions we taken that impact this quarter but also substantially improve our position going in march we completed the transaction to outsource our internal logistics process to geodis and we booked a gainof million net of a related charge for real our call in january i mentioned that we would complete the outsourcing arrangement in the first quarter and that the gain would be relatively offset by a higher level of restructuring in the first part of the second this quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about million most of which was for our services business we expect to spend between million and million globally for the full year which is a typical level of restructuring for us and as we said a lot of this was skewed to the first part of the year since most of this is behind us the benefits of these actions will start to come through in the second we took additional specific reserves against our accounts receivable balance this contributed to a increase in ar provisions of about million our reserve coverage on accounts receivable is now percent up basis points from a year ago and up basis points from year believe the increase in reserves is appropriate given the current economic few other items that i mention had impacts to our had a impact of million from investment transactions primarily driven sale of lenovo shares in the first quarter of last other income and expense interest income was down about million reflecting the current interest rate as you would expect we have from our hedge of cash flowprograms reflected in other income and expense sg a and cost of goods sold is about million in total with about half in other income and expense of course this mitigates the impact of the stronger dollar throughout the income though it was not a we absorbed million of cost and expense for the quarter we now expect about billion of cost and expense for the year about flat year to year that an improvement from our previous by getting into the segments i quickly show you our margin performance by is the quarter of the last that we expanded our gross margin with about three quarters of this quarter improvement coming from our better margins in services and software and the balance from a mix shift to our software the expense performance i just took you through we expanded total margin by get into some of the drivers within the segment discussion but bottom line margins reflect the shift of our business to higher value areas and our constant focus on improving now i turn to our segment performance starting with services two global services segments delivered strong signings and profit margin performance this signings were up percent at constant currency and total signings were up percent at constant currency total margin was up points driving our services profit understood the challenges we would face as we entered and we continued to execute on cost and expense actions consistent with the transformation of our business will see the benefit from our first quarter actions in margin improvement for the remainder of the combined segments delivered billion of revenue in the quarter down percent as reported and down percent at constant currency combined gross margins were up points and we delivered billion in profit at a margin of were billion at actual currency rates down percent but up percent at constant in our outsourcing businesses were billion up percent at actual currency rates and up percent at constant signings which include consulting and systems integration and integrated technology services were billion down percent at actual rates and percent at constant signed deals larger than million and that on top of the deals larger than million that we signed in fourth quarter last at the end of the quarter was an estimated billion as a reminder we are now reporting backlog at actual currency rates excluding the impact of currency backlog was flat quarter to quarter and up billion year to i turn to the key drivers of performance in the two services services executed very well in a challenging environment totalsignings were up percent at constant currency and outsourcing signings were up percent at constant currency profit was up percent and margin was up points revenue was down percent as reported and down percent at constant outsourcing revenue was down percent as reported and down percent at constant currency had a strong quarter in so signings up percent at constant currency this was led by good growth in north america and the growth markets within north america canada was particularly talked in the past about the compelling value proposition strategic outsourcing provides to our clients as it gives them a lower cost base and better variability over the contract had two strong quarters of so signings and expect growth again in the second quarter with this signings performance we expect revenue to return to growth in the second half of the technology services revenue was down percent as reported and up percent at constant currency integrated technology services signings or the gts signings were down percent at constant we continue to get good results in efficiency plays such as optimization and managed services we seeing declines in large rollouts with high oem capital been shifting our portfolio to higher value offerings and away from oem content so while this quarter we had lower signings and revenue the mix away from oem gives us better gross profit technology services profitwas up percent and marginimproved points year to year to was the seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth and again we had gross margin expansion in all lines of improvements were driven by a combination of greater mix to higher value offerings particularly in integrated technology services where the key plays are becoming a larger portion of the portfolio and cost and expense management driven by our initiatives in standardization global integration and improved work we done to improve efficiency not only drives our margin improvement but gives us the flexibility and capability needed to quickly address rapidly changing environments and really positions us for when the economy to global business services totalsignings were up percent at constant currency profit was down percent or about million year to year with margin essentially flat revenue was down percent as reported and down percent at constant at revenue from a geographic perspective we had good results in the growth markets where revenue growth accelerated from the second half of however in the major markets revenue was impacted by lower outsourcing signings last year and a deferral of some to gbs signings our application outsourcing signings were up almost percent at constant currency with good growth in both the major and growth the major markets clients continue to be primarily motivated by cost savings opportunities but in the growth markets we still see a balance between cost savings and infrastructure our category of consulting and systems integration signings were down percent at constant currency within that declines in the very small contracts the ones that most impact near term revenue yield were most a sector perspective we had good growth in public and communications sectors but not enough to offset declines in industrial and general business and we still see over percent of the deals coming from cost savings and efficiency will continue to evolve and adapt our offerings to meet the changing needs of our clients as an example we just announced the launch of our new business analytics and optimization service line this practice will draw on the full breadth of ibm capabilities including deep industry expertise research and software capabilities we think this is going to have an immediate impact on our clients ability to improve speed and quality of business we look forward we will see the benefits of our recent workforce rebalancing actions over the remainder of the year and we got the management and delivery structure in place in both services segments to continue to expand margin in fact we expect profit growth in the second on to software the billion of revenue was down to year up percent at constant currency software income was up percent and we expanded margin by almost was a solid quarter in a tough economic continued to purchase mission critical software to run their businesses and demand was strong for software that delivers fast returns on investment while adoption of software for transformational projects slowed and purchases were heavily me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance which was up percent at constant products grew percent or percent at constant currency and gained servers allow customers to build run and integrate their business applications they were up percent or percent at constant which was acquired in december did very well this quarter and helped drive our websphere business integration segment to management software declined percent or up percent at constant relational database continued to perform well up percent and at constant forward our information management software is a key component of our new business analytics and optimization service software was down percent up percent at constant currency and we gained had strong constant currency growth in all three of tivoli product sets security systems management and storage utilized tivoli software to improve control and automation of their infrastructure this lowers costs and drives management software grew percent or percent at constant currency as customers optimized their storage was down percent but rational had a very strong quarter and gained share with revenue growth of percent or percent at constant currency this performance was driven by strength in our performance and security testing offerings which deliver return on investment benefits to our all software brands we have strong recurring revenue in fact annuity content represents of our software business this provides a good base of profit and helped our software business to deliver solid performance in this tough and technology of billion was down percent year to year or percent at constant continued to have strength in the high end of our servers driven by virtualization increased efficiency and good returns on quarter was the fifth consecutive quarter of mips growth on mainframe servers and we had revenue growth in the of power quarter our systems business held on the brands system z revenue declined percent year to year or percent at constant currency while mips grew from specialty engines were up nearly percent driven by over percent growth in linux global reach was clearly an advantage system z revenue grew percent in our growth markets which is up percent at constant markets were weak particularly in europe as we wrapped around on a strong system p was down percent but up percent at constant currency gaining points of share revenue from our high end converged system p continued to be very strong revenue was up percent we had unix competitive displacements this quarter with half of the transactions over x server revenue declined to the demand for solutions continues to soften as customers virtualize workloads and consolidate onto more efficient declined percent year to year with declines in both disk and tape performance was in line with the in these storage results reflect the hardware performance only which is a subset of our broader storage solutions but more of the value of the storage solution is shifting to software and services and as i mentioned our tivoli storage software had a very good systems and technology results reflect the challenge of this economic flow to ibm cash performance we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter up million year to improvement was driven by lower capital expenditures we also had improved sales cycle working capital offset by a higher level of pension funding for our at the uses of cash we reduced debt by billion and we also returned nearly billion to our hundred million dollars of the shareholder return was through dividends and billion was share bought back million shares in the quarter and our average diluted shares were down the end of march we had billion remaining from our last board to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of nearly billion with of our cash in the remaining asset decline was driven by normal seasonal decline in global financing assets and a stronger to debt as i mentioned earlier we reduced debt by billion in the first have billion of term debt maturities to go this year and we comfortable with that level given our cash balance continued cash generation and experience in the capital ended the quarter with commercial paper of about million which is up slightly from year end but still very low as compared to experience in the cp markets remains positive and we have substantial flexibility in the our billion of total debt at the end of the quarter billion supports our global financing segment leveraged at seven to again we put some information on our global financing business in the supplemental see that percent of this portfolio is investment grade and while our reserves have increased consistent with the economic environment this business still provides a very strong percent return on equity i take that any remaining debt the debt was billion down billion from year end and was strong cash flow and significant cash position allow us to continue to invest and deploy capital to where we see the best long term bridge to i start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share chart demonstrates that our first quarter results are consistent with the profile we laid out in had a decline in revenue at actual rates which impacted eps growth by improved mix and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded a significant amount of margin expansion which resulted in relatively flat with our ongoing share repurchase activity we delivered percent growth in earnings per are executing a plan that is right for this environment and keeps us for the have been transforming our business for a decade shifting to higher value areas globalizing our operations and adapting our offerings to deliver value to our we saw the environment deteriorate we increased our focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency to improve our balance point all of this positioned us to deliver strong profit and cash flow in this challenging environment and also come out stronger when the economy starts to strong financial position gives us investment flexibility so we very focused on the future see a real opportunity in smarter planet initiatives business analytics and new compute models such as cloud computing as well as our ongoing focus to capture the opportunity in the growth great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to be opportunistic in our investments and deploy capital to where we see the best long term returns whether that be our growth initiatives acquisitions or returning value to now with one quarter of behind us we continue to expect earnings per share of at least for the year it come more from margin improvement just as it did in the first we continue to execute our strategy and maintain our focus on delivering profit and cash over the longer term and though it is early in we remain ahead of pace for our patricia and i will take your you we begin the q a i like to remind you

for joining us quarter we delivered of earnings per share up percent year to year this is a record level of eps for a first second or third quarter adjusting for stock generated over billion of cash from operations and ended the quarter with billion of cash on hand and we returned another billion to shareholders with million in dividends and billion of share this powerful performance we now expect to generate at least of earnings per share for the year up cents from our previous view of at least is the result of the strategic transformation of our ongoing shift to higher value areas has positioned us to better meet clients needs this quarter our strategic outsourcing signings were up percent at constant currency and our key branded middleware revenue now percent of software grew percent at constant strategic acquisitions continue to contribute to our higher value capabilities this quarter cognos telelogic ilog and storage solutions xiv and diligent all showed very strong as you will see margins are fueling our profit growth i discuss how our transformation is driving this but it is the shift to higher value globally integrating our business and our ongoing productivity initiatives that led to significant margin improvement we expanded our margin by points that our best margin improvement in almost four years when we divested our pc quarter our strategy and business model together delivered high levels of profit in a tough economic key point here is that our model delivers improved margins even when revenue growth is a headwind so when revenue growth becomes a tailwind the operating leverage we created will really come through and continue to drive our using this financial strength to invest in new areas that will help drive the next growth cycle for our clients areas like smarter planet business analytics and cloud come back to that later in the financial at our income statement for the quarter our revenue was billion down percent as reported and percent at constant the revenue decline we improved both and net income by percent with outstanding margin margin expanded over points due to improving margin in services and software and the mix to higher value businesses such as expense was better by percent year to year driven by actions we taken to continue to transform and globalize the business focused expense management and the benefit of a stronger margin was up over points year to year to percent this is ibm highest pti margin in ten years in a first second or third ibm total net income margin was up a lower share count from our ongoing share repurchase activity bottom line we improved earnings per share by percent year to year to actions to develop this margin improvement did just happen we have been working on this strategy for a decade so let me give you some background that will provide perspective on our second quarter at ibm performance over the last several years we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since can see the impact of the last recession following the bubble where a sales decline and the resulting charges impacted our margins and our then we have been executing our strategy shifting to higher value segments globally integrating the company driving efficiency and productivity and investing to capture future now ibm is a fundamentally different company with a stronger portfolio of offerings and a more efficient cost structure enabled by ongoing process improvements and so now in the current recession we able to improve margin and profit even with declining it pretty obvious that the driver of our profit growth over the last several years has been margin you go back to the our gross margin was declining with increasing pressure from commoditizing products this was a massive headwind for us which impacted our ability to reinvest in the then we exited commoditizing businesses including hdd in pcs in and printers in which represent nearly billion of annual revenue in that same time we acquired over companies for about billion this has clearly accelerated our shift to higher value disciplined focus on shifting our business mix and our business model has driven this turnaround in can see we been consistently improving our margin every year and with that strong performance instead of the constantly eroding relationship we been able to grow our rate of we had the highest gross margin since our margin in the first half of is already higher than the full year and that without the fourth we made a lot of progress on margins but we still have headroom in the may investor briefing we showed you how our pti margin compared to the s p and the tech universe we included that same chart in the supplementals updated for our second quarter business shift in our business mix is even more apparent on a profit basis this chart lays out the sum of the segments which of course is a little different than total to the profit from software and services combined almost we continuing to drive solid profit growth in software and services in fact we expect both software and services pti to grow this year as you can see software grows from billion in to about billion this year and services from billion to approximately again in we expect ongoing momentum in our software and services with that perspective i start to get into the details of the quarter starting with by key industry sales want to start with the industry view to give you a feel not just for the current performance by sector but also the kinds of projects we working on to help our clients create more value and become more sector revenue was down percent as reported and percent at constant sector was the fastest growing sector for the fourth consecutive quarter revenue was up percent at constant currency with constant currency growth in all in the education industry are investing in it infrastructure and our revenue was up nearly percent at constant currency cloud computing is a way to reduce costs and extend access to educational resources by designing and deploying wireless and converged networks we are equipping schools to better deal with their it few days ago we announced that the largest school district in alabama is using ibm analytics technology to more effectively measure student performance and adjust programs to deliver smarter education services customizable dashboards provide data to monitor the entire lifecycle of each student including attendance grades and special education healthcare where our revenue was up percent at constant currency is working with clients around the world to create smarter health care getting real traction in solutions to create accessible electronic health records and are using business analytics to drive efficiency and healthcare let me comment on the other sector revenue was down percent at constant clients continue to invest in infrastructure and transformation projects with payback we leading in the creation of smart grids with our intelligent utility network solution with five of the largest smart metering deployments in north financial services where revenue was down percent at constant currency we continue to help clients manage costs capital requirements and risk and banks worldwide use ibm financial services data models to help address financial risk customer insight and financial reporting this is a strong base on which to build next generation risk bringing together our leading capabilities in analytics and in supercomputing to address some of this sector major challenges i mention two specific areas we working with the leading financial regulatory and supervisory bodies worldwide to explore how a new generation of smarter systems could not only enable effective market supervision but also provide an early warning system for global systemic risk management we also working with several of the world largest financial services companies to help them streamline regulatory and compliance reporting refine enterprise management reporting and improve across all their operations these are great offerings for our clients in this sector remains challenging especially in retail and travel transportation industries total sector revenue was down percent at constant in this environment the growth markets provide good near term opportunities in these industries for example we are working with nearly of the top rail systems globally to determine new ways to work together to build out the modern smart rail systems of the you would expect with an percent decline at constant currency industrial sector remains the most challenging as clients continue to deal with the global downturn in consumer by to our geographic revenue similar to the first quarter performance was fairly consistent across the always i focus my comments on the constant currency the major markets declined percent as customers remain focused on saving cost and conserving the growth markets which are percent of ibm geographic revenue we again delivered points of growth above the major the bric countries declined overall the performance and prospects differ by example india grew modestly with strong growth in services mitigated by weak transaction performance and while china declined from a very strong second quarter of we had good growth in second and third tier cities we expect to return to constant currency growth in china in the third i move on to the segment view for revenue and gross and gross margin by revenue growth was impacted by currency and the economic environment but our broad business capabilities our ability to deliver value to customers and our significant base of recurring revenues came through with solid performance in was led by key branded middleware where we gained you would expect in this environment our transaction businesses were most challenged specifically hardware and consulting where we were impacted by a slowdown in makes our gross margin expansion of points even more part of our ongoing transformation we continue to shift to higher value the most obvious driver being the mix to software which contributed about half a point of each segment we driving a shift to higher value as well for example away from the lower margin oem content toward the higher margin higher value content within our integrated technology ongoing initiatives to improve our services productivity through global delivery capabilities a more variable workforce and better utilization also contribute to the improvement these initiatives and dozens of others are all part of the transformation and have driven consistent improvement in our gross margin over fact this is the quarter of the last that we expanded our gross let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and investment and investment quarter our total expense and other income was down expense improved points year to drove points of decline and reflects both translation of based expenses and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to been executing an operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity across the business all part of our transformation to higher value areas and to the enterprise the implications to our business are important they reduce our cost structure and make it more variable a lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point so with improved operating leverage every dollar of revenue yields more quarter our recent initiatives such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce contributed to our margin improvement for the full year we now expect billion of cost and expense savings from these the same time we were able to leverage our strong margins to continue a significant level of reinvestment we are investing in capabilities that will differentiate ibm in the future and accelerate the development of new market example in support of smarter planet solutions percent of our research projects are dedicated to these initiatives which take it well beyond its traditional data center boundaries this requires both unique technical capabilities and skills in areas like healthcare transportation telecommunications and utility invested almost billion in strategic acquisitions since to build business analytics capabilities this provides the foundation for the creation of a business analytics practice and we redeployed and hired resources to address this opportunity later this month we will announce a new integrated business analytics system designed to accelerate the deployment of advanced analytics capabilities leveraging ibm hardware software and have also been making substantial investments to build our cloud capabilities in we announced the ibm smart business cloud portfolio with solutions to help clients deploy their own clouds targeting specific workloads as well as new services delivered over the ibm cloud we will add to this portfolio in the we initiated these targeted investments to position ibm for continued growth and improved margin close out the discussion on spending as always i lay out the roadmap items that had significant impacts to our had a impact of million from investment transactions this was driven by a charge of almost million related to an investment in a joint venture this charge also increased our effective tax rate in the quarter by basis absorbed over million and expense for which was down million year to yearwe continue to expect about billion of cost and expense for the other income and expense interest income was down almost million reflecting the current interest rate as you would expect we have a benefit from our hedge of cash flow programs reflected in other income and expense sg a and cost of goods sold this mitigates the impact of the stronger dollar throughout the income statement benefit is about million in total with more than half in other income and now let turn to our segment by is a snapshot of both gross and margins by gross margin up points and expense reduction of percent we delivered a point improvement in as you can see we increased our margin in every segment with particular strength in gts up over points software up over points and global financing up almost importantly we operating at a very high level of profitability with an percent get into more detail on margins in the segment discussions so let start with combined services business did a tremendous job driving profitability and margin expansion this what continues to be a challenging economic environment total profit was up percent on revenue that was down percent as reported and percent at constant gross margins were up points we improved gross margin in of the past quarters and we delivered billion in profit up points year to were billion at actual rates down percent but up percent at constant currency we signed deals larger than million signings in our outsourcing businesses were billion up percent at actual currency rates and up percent at constant currency this includes the third consecutive quarter of signings growth in strategic at the end of the quarter was an estimated billion backlog was up billion since march and flat quarter to quarter at constant i turn to the key drivers of performance in the two services technology services signings were up percent at constant currency and within that outsourcing signings were up percent at constant outsourcing signings were particularly strong up percent at constant currency growing in all major geographies within that so in north america was up over percent at constant currency we are providing innovative solutions to help clients drive efficiency and cost savings we expect our strong value proposition to continue to drive outsourcing signings in the second technology services the quarter was billion down percent at constant growth in outsourcing signings provides a solid book of business revenue in the quarter was impacted by reduced volumes in our existing client base in integrated technology services we are continuing to drive our product portfolio toward higher value higher margin offerings and away from oem content this quarter its revenue performance largely reflected signings declines in the oem offerings that support capital intensive product turning to profit the gts team executed across the portfolio to drive powerful profit technology services profitwas up percent and marginimproved points year to year to percent this was the eighth consecutive quarter of profit growth and again we had gross margin expansion in all lines of sustained margin performance is a result of the transformation we undertaken in continue to make structural changes to service delivery our initiatives around standardization global integration and automation have resulted in a more flexible and productive organization operating with improved efficiency these changes helped drive performance this quarter not only did we execute significant cost and expense actions we also continued to improve quality and customer satisfaction and that is quite an to global business services signings were down percent at constant currency and within that consulting and systems integration signings were down percent at constant was down percent as reported and down percent at constant currency off of a very strong quarter last year in spite of that revenue performance gbs improved margin by points year to revenue performance reflects lower signings in consulting where we had a more pronounced decline in smaller contracts starting last year clients were focused on solutions that help them to save cost and drive greater efficiency during the first half of this year despite this continued focus we have seen an increase in required approvals and the delay of more discretionary projects that said we continued to grow systems integration revenue and for total gbs we had strength in public sector and our growth markets all at constant global business services profitdown percent and marginimproved points year to year to were able to do this because of the transformation we undertaken over the past several years we have built a global infrastructure and framework that supports a very dynamic resource deployment model it drives improved utilization and service delivery our professional workforce tools provide skills and availability at the tip of your finger we can then shift people to where the work is optimizing the mix of ibm employees and subcontractors around the globe overall we have a much more flexible and dynamic model than we ever quarter the key drivers of this margin performance were cost and expense savings from our recent workforce rebalancing actions lower subcontractor spending and higher utilization in our global delivery centers we expect to continue to see the benefits from these actions in the second half of the year as to software revenue of billion was down percent year to year and flat at constant had terrific profit performance with segment income up percent year to year and margin up points to software business continued to perform well in this economic environment led by key branded middleware that grew percent at constant currency and gained again customers purchased software that delivers fast payback as well as transformational projects with strong return on quarter branded middleware accounted for percent of our total software revenue up points from second quarter of other than our fourth quarter this is the highest percentage of key branded middleware let me give you some insight into the products grew percent or percent at constant currency and gained process management commerce and datapower product segments all grew double digits at constant currency ilog which helps to drive business rules management to the analytics space did very well again this quarter and contributed to websphere growth ilog middleware grew over percent year to year from its management software declined percent but grew percent at constant which was acquired in january of grew over percent at actual and percent at constant currency we also had strong growth in our information integration and master data management products which customers utilize to transform their enterprise data for competitive advantage our information management software is a key driver of our new business analytics and optimization service software was down percent but up percent at constant currency and we gained that tivoli storage products grew percent or percent at constant currency driving this growth are the hot higher value areas of virtualization and open disk storage which together grew over percent we built the latter two capabilities through our diligent and xiv software declined percent or percent at constant currency versus a difficult compare last was impacted by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and revenue declined percent but was up percent at constant currency and gained market leveraged the productivity and return on investment enabled by ibm suite of software tools rational products accelerate and simplify collaboration across the software development process telelogic products grew over percent and extended our reach into the systems development market breadth of our software portfolio the strong recurring revenue and disciplined expense management combined to deliver percent profit growth in a challenging economic and technology of billion was down percent year to year percent at constant believe this performance is in line with the industry now remember at this point in the first quarter we also estimated in line performance but after our competitors reported their results based on industry reports we actually gained a point of share in the first few second quarter highlights converged system p once again we gained share we significantly increased the number of unix competitive displacements to well over in the quarter within that we more than doubled the number of sun competitive displacements from the first the first half of the year this amounts to nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in sales from unix competitive system x we anticipate that we gained share for the second consecutive storage products held share we had over high end tape competitive displacements in the second quarter and strong performance in our storage acquisitions xiv and diligent which also have significant software on the brands declined percent year to year and percent at constant currency as we wrapped around on a very strong markets were weak as we experienced a lengthening of the customer decision cycle for hardware commitments our growth markets were up percent at constant declined percent in the quarter but were up percent on a two year compounded growth rate as we simply had a very tough compare in the second quarter of which was up improved as gross profit margin expanded by points year to year due to a higher percentage of microcode this month we will announce new system z workloads that target growing market segments such as business applications data warehousing and security these new custom offerings that we call system z solution editions integrate a portfolio of enterprise software and security products with the system z platform they will be competitively positioned to attract new workloads to system z and will expand the platform value proposition to both new and existing system percent year to year and percent at constant gained share in the unix market for the fifth consecutive quarter share gains have been the most pronounced in the midrange and high end of our product line where our success in driving consolidation and virtualization has delivered proven results as i mentioned earlier we doubled the number of competitive displacements from the first profit margin also improved points year to year through solid cost revenue declined percent year to year or percent at constant currency and we gained share for the second consecutive believe the improved sales execution and strong performance from our new products will enable us to continue to gain market share through the second were down percent year to year ibm was the first to deliver blades with the new processors and we benefited from strong customer adoption of this new technology we believe we gained share in blades also expanded margins in system declined percent year to year percent at constant currency and we expect to hold share despite declines in both disk and storage acquisitions are ramping well xiv added over new storage customers in the second quarter since we purchased the company we added over new customers who had not purchased ibm open storage in the last two value in storage continues to shift to software and as i mentioned during our software discussion we had very strong performance in this let me close my comments on systems and technology by saying that with our new capabilities and continued share gains we expect to improve revenue performance starting in the third quarter and deliver year to year profit growth in the fourth flow to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter down about million year to decline was driven by less cash from sales cycle working capital a higher level of workforce rebalancing payments and higher funding requirements mitigated by the impact of lower net tax with that free cash flow was up million in the first half to this strong and recurring free cash flow we were able to return billion to shareholders in the first paid billion in dividends this includes a percent increase approved by the board of directors in april we tripled our dividend over the last spent billion in the first half on share repurchases this drove a reduction in average diluted shares of percent year to year and we have billion remaining from our board now let turn to the balance ended the half with a cash balance of billion that an increase of million from the end of last quarter more than of our cash is in the debt was billion this is down billion from march and down billion since the end of three billion dollars of the first half decrease went to reduce our financing was percent down from percent at the end of the first quarter and percent at year billion of debt our global financing business is leveraged at balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share improved mix and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded significant margin expansion in fact expense productivity and tax nearly offset the impact of our revenue decline and so the real driver was our gross margin expansion contributing cents of eps with our ongoing share repurchase activity we delivered percent growth in earnings per performance is the result of the strategic transformation of our the end of the bubble we been moving out of commoditizing businesses while investing in higher value areas this better positions us to meet client needs and drives a more profitable also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency these transformational changes to our business have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point generating more profit from each dollar of using our strong profit and cash base to

great quarter driven by strong profit performance in software and services and share gains in both hardware and quarter our revenue was up sequentially and our growth rate improved second quarter we expanded gross margin by almost points and margin by over points year to year our earnings per share is up percent to in addition we generated billion of free cash flow up almost billion year to year and ended the quarter with billion of cash on hand while reducing our debt by billion since now expect to deliver at least of earnings per share for the year up cents from our previous view of at least you look at the third quarter as compared to the second quarter though earnings per share growth is the same both up percent we extended our share gains this instance in software we gained almost points of share in websphere where we compete with oracle we also gained share in information management tivoli and rational these share gains drove points of constant currency growth in branded middleware hardware we gained points of share in system p and points of share in system that lot of share and we taking it from both sun and hp these share gains drove the improvement in our hardware revenue growth rate which is points better than last growth from our services business was fairly consistent with second quarter but the real story here was our ability to deliver profit growth by continually expanding margins this quarter our services margin was almost percent on a comparable basis our services margin is better than any of our key competitors and believe me we not with an improving trend in revenue performance we continued to generate profit growth through margin the last several years we have been shifting to higher value areas and significantly changing our mix of the same time our ongoing focus on driving productivity in all areas of the business is reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance continue to expect about billion of cost and expense savings this year from the structural actions we taken and remember we got a spend base of almost billion to work so we got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more impact of our transformation on this quarter profitability is clear and compelling our combined services segment margin was up points year to year and in software we grew segment profit by over percent and margin by over points for the year we continue to expect to generate about billion of profit in software and billion in using this strong profit and cash generation to invest in capabilities that differentiate ibm and accelerate the development of new market opportunities areas we discussed in the past like business analytics and smarter planet and cloud we just closed a strong third quarter consistent with the momentum in our business throughout and we going into the fourth quarter now let get into the details of the financial revenue was billion down percent as reported and percent at constant the revenue decline we increased income by percent and net income by percent with outstanding margin margin expanded points due to better margins in services and software and a more profitable mix of expense was better by percent year to year driven by actions we taken to continue to transform and globalize the business and focused expense management in a tough margin was up over points year to year to percent and ibm net income margin was up points to finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year to year though it was up sequentially due to increased bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up percent from a year let turn to by total geographic revenue was down percent as reported and percent at constant always i focus my comments on constant growth improved versus the second quarter in every geography americas was down percent points better than second quarter emea was down percent and asia pacific was down percent both improvements from last to the major markets and growth markets we had improved performance in the major was down percent year to year an improvement of points the growth markets were down percent though china had great performance up percent overall the growth markets delivered percent of ibm geographic revenue in the quarter and outpaced the majors by points of now let turn to revenue by by key industry sales sector revenue was down percent as reported and percent at constant currency which is one point better than last quarter growth the third quarter of last year financial services performance at constant currency has generally been in line with the total sector performance this quarter financial services revenue growth at constant currency improved points last quarter to down percent within fss the banking industry returned to growth at constant sector was again the fastest growing sector with percent growth at constant currency led by healthcare and education now i think this is quite logical given the rollout of stimulus spend me give you an example of what we doing with a healthcare client at elizabeth hospital in kentucky ibm is helping to connect hospitals clinics and physicians offices in the state largest of electronic medical records to improve patient care and lower costs the system is expected to replace a warehouse full of records on more than patients in the elizabeth healthcare are real systematic approaches to improving sector was down percent at constant currency but underneath it the utilities industry are working on nearly smart grid engagements across growth and major markets let me give you an example here as is providing expertise in smart metering large meter data management business analytics and security to help oncor the largest electric delivery business in texas this quarter oncor achieved a significant milestone the reporting of interval meter data to the market with our help oncor is expected to replace over three million standard meters with advanced meter systems by sector performance improved slightly from second quarter down percent year to year at constant currency in the growth markets we had strength in the travel and transportation industry as infrastructure investments in airlines and passenger rail industrial sector also improved it remains the most challenging down percent at constant currency as clients are impacted by the economic downturn and are focused on to position for the let turn to revenue and profit by and gross margin by ability to deliver value to customers and our ability to take share in a competitive market resulted in improved revenue was driven by strong demand for our key branded has a solid recurring revenue base but also reflects challenges in the more consulting business and hardware had significant share gains and cut its rate of decline in half from last gross profit margin improvement of points in this environment was quite part of our ongoing transformation we continue to shift to higher value the most obvious driver being the mix to software which contributed almost of the margin quarter our ongoing initiatives to improve our services margins through global delivery capabilities and improved resource deployment models also contributed to the initiatives are driving consistent improvement in our gross margin over time in fact this is the quarter of the last that we expanded our gross let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total expense and other income was down drove points of the decline and reflects both translation of based expenses and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to contributed a point of growth but the largest contributor to expense reduction was our operational expense which improved points year to almost billion of cost and expense to work with we been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity leveraging scale and our global footprint we focused on all areas of the business from sales efficiency to supply chain management to service delivery to global support we on track to yield billion of cost and expense savings in from our recent initiatives such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our initiatives reduce our cost structure and make it more variable a lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point so with improved operating leverage every dollar of revenue yields more the same time our strong margins enable us to continue a significant level of reinvestment focusing on capabilities that will help to drive the next growth cycle by delivering value to of our primary investment areas is business analytics advanced and services allow customers who generate enormous amounts of data to predict trends optimize their operations and create new sources of revenue provides a solid platform for our smarter planet continuing to add to our capabilities we just closed another key acquisition spss a leader in predictive analytics with this we now invested billion in strategic acquisitions since to build our business analytics we recently announced a new advanced analytics center in new york city with consultants and researchers connected to the service line we launched earlier this close out the discussion on spending as always i lay out the roadmap of items that had significant impacts to our items hurt our profit had a impact of million from investment transactions driven by lenovo transactions in the third quarter of last within other income and expense interest income was down almost million year to year reflecting the current interest rate few items helped our profit i start with accounts receivable provision last year our reserve coverage was percent this year it percent so we got a higher rate of coverage year to year but with revenue down and receivables down this level of coverage resulted in a reduction in ar provisions of about our workforce rebalancing charges were down over finally we have a million benefit from our hedge of cashflowprograms reflected in other income and expense sg a and cost of goods plans had little impact on our profit growth this quarter but let me comment on the fourth you know we constantly working on our plans and in the quarter we expect a curtailment gain of over due to a change we making in our plans this will be more than offset by additional workforce rebalancing activity outside the now expect cost to be billion for the now let turn to our segment by is a snapshot of both gross and margins by gross margin up points and expense reduction of percent we delivered a point improvement in as you can see for the second consecutive quarter our performance was led by gts up over points and software up over we delivered margin of you can see on the next chart there a lot of room to continue to improve these at the s p twenty five percent of the companies have margins above if you look at the tech universe as defined by the companies with a market cap over billion percent are above with our mix to higher value and higher margin areas such as software and our ongoing initiatives against our nearly billion of spend we have a lot of opportunity to continue to expand margins and drive profit let turn to the segments starting with the continued challenging economic climate the combined services businesses drove an percent increase in profit and expanded margin points to percent we improving margin by focusing on a competitive cost structure while delivering value and quality to our the quarter we signed billion in total outsourcing contracts up percent year to year in addition we signed three deals in the first two days of october with a total value of nearly billion these three deals would have pushed our outsourcing growth rate to percent at constant currency which is consistent with the first half performance of percent a solid start to the quarter and looking at the pipeline of deals we have we should be able to grow outsourcing signings in the fourth in our offerings of consulting and integrated technology services continue to reflect the economic environment these signings were down a combined percent at actual rates and down percent at constant services signings were billion down percent year to year we signed deals larger than at the end of the quarter was an estimated billion that up almost billion since second quarter and billion year to year excluding currency it up billion year to year so that puts us in a pretty strong backlog position as we enter the fourth quarter and i go to the key drivers of performance in the two services technology services total signings were down percent at actual rates and percent at constant signings were down percent at constant currency but with the three deals signed by october gts outsourcing signings would have been up percent at constant technology services the quarter was billion down percent at constant currency outsourcing signings are up a very strong percent at constant currency which will add to the revenue base over a longer period of integrated technology services we continue to shift our portfolio to higher value higher margin offerings revenue performance largely reflected several quarters of signings declines in the oem offerings that support capital intensive product so while this quarter we had lower signings and revenue in its the shift to standardized offerings as well as a mix away from oem gives us better year to year and quarter to quarter gross profit technology strong gross profit contribution across all lines of the business with total profitup points year to year to percent this was the ninth consecutive quarter of profit margin performance continues to be driven by the structural changes we made in service delivery and a shift to higher value in integrated technology services global delivery tools and automation lean process techniques hardware and software optimization and subcontractor efficiency all contribute to productivity improvements and we have maintained the focus on our customers with high levels of quality customer satisfaction and services level agreement to global business services signings were down percent at actual rates and down percent at constant outsourcing signings were up percent and percent at constant currency with strong growth in both major and growth markets application outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost savings driving out both application maintenance costs and legacy application costs our pipeline has been steadily improving and our rolling four quarter signings growth rate has now turned and systems integration signings were down percent signings continue to be impacted by economic conditions on a global basis however we did have good signings growth at constant currency in north america up percent and public sector globally up business services revenue was down percent with a margin improvement of point to percent global business services delivered better than balanced profit down a tough environment our business continues to be supported by a very dynamic delivery model our global delivery infrastructure and framework global delivery capabilities scalable subcontractor management and improved resource deployment models this quarter these capabilities enabled us to drive improved cost and expense management lower subcontractor spending and improved utilization both in our delivery centers and overall for services the teams did a good job managing margin in a tough environment we believe that the dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities we built give us a real competitive advantage and it why we are confident that we be able to deliver segment profit of about billion for the and technology technology revenue was billion down percent year to year at actual rates and percent at constant currency consistent with what we said in july these results will substantially outperform the industry gaining share in systems technology in servers and in now expect stg to deliver profit growth in the fourth z revenue declined percent against a very strong compare mips were down percent but up percent on a two year compounded growth rate this performance is consistent with what we would expect at this point in the product quarter we introduced a set of new system z workloads called system z solution editions which expand the platform value proposition to both new and existing customers system z gross profit margin expanded by points year to year driven by a higher mix of upgrades in the system p revenue declined percent or percent at constant currency and we gained points of share this is the sixth consecutive quarter of share have increased the revenue generated from competitive displacements of sun and hp customers to over million this quarter this amounts to more than million in sales from unix competitive takeouts year to x server revenue grew percent year to year or percent at constant currency we took points of share and it our third consecutive quarter of share gains in our improved sales model and enhanced product set are the key contributors to this x blades grew over percent year to year and we gained points of share storage revenue declined percent year to disk we again gained storage acquisitions xiv and diligent had strong performance xiv added more than new customers during the quarter and over customers since we purchased the gained share in tape as well as we continue to displace oem revenue was down percent year to year a significant improvement over recent technology was sold out in the quarter when you look at the broader demand for our technology we are building now and are on track for our systems launch in the first half of we have strong yields in fact we are running five months ahead of our ramp so this is going very and technology revenue performance significantly improved from last quarter as we took market share in a tough environment in system p we took points of share in system x we took points and also points of share in blades and in both disk and tape storage we gained profit margins increased in most of the team did a really good job this quarter and stg is on track to deliver profit growth in the fourth revenue of billion was down percent year to year but flat at constant had another quarter of market share gains in software and very strong profit performance segment income was up percent year to year and margin was up points to branded middleware grew percent year to year or percent at constant currency and we gained share year to year for the eighth consecutive we discuss the brands i would like to comment on the makeup of our software business and why we focus on key branded the right side of the pie chart are primarily our legacy products which generate substantial profit and cash on the left side is our key branded middleware the fastest growing portion of our portfolio as you saw again this quarter as this middleware becomes a larger percentage of the total it lifts the overall software growth rate this quarter key branded middleware was percent of total software up points year to software we have a broad portfolio of products that have a strong value proposition in this environment many of our products like websphere portal and tivoli storage deliver a fast payback these types of products grew percent at constant currency year to year in this our transformational offerings including cognos and information integration grew at constant let me take you through the had another exceptional this space our primary competitor is oracle since they acquired bea this quarter we gained nearly points of share with revenue growth of percent or percent at constant currency application servers which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for business applications grew percent or percent at constant currency business integration software which includes our very successful ilog acquisition grew over percent at constant currency these two solutions are key components of our websphere management software was flat year to year but grew percent at constant currency and gained and infosphere software which enables continuous and extremely fast analysis of massive volumes of data both posted growth at constant currency and gained share these are two key components of our business analytics acquisition of spss which was completed in early october further strengthens our business analytics and optimization strategy by providing predictive analytic capabilities that help customers drive better business had another strong quarter growing percent or percent at constant currency tivoli grew and gained share across all three product areas systems security and storage enterprise asset management software grew over percent year to year and is a key component of our smarter planet past week we announced smarter transportation projects with three of the largest and busiest mass transit systems in the long island rail road bay area rapid transit and washington dc metro all three of these clients are using tivoli asset management offerings to predict where and when equipment needs to be repaired or replaced ultimately improving the safety and reliability of the transportation system while reducing traffic congestion in these software declined percent or percent at constant currency with this performance we held share lotus continued to be impacted by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and grew percent or percent at constant currency and gained integrated software tools improve the speed quality and efficiency for our customers with software development in summary software had a really terrific quarter and we gained significant market share across the portfolio in websphere information management rational and tivoli in key branded middleware and in total with this performance we are taking share from key competitors like oracle and microsoft we delivered percent profit growth and expanded margins and we remain on track to deliver about billion of segment profit this year that up from billion in and up from billion in so that demonstrates the substantial transformation in ibm business flow to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter up billion year to is exceptional performance in fact a record level of free cash flow in a third increase was driven by higher net income and improved cash from sales cycle working capital as collections remain strong and inventory low these were partially offset by higher the first three quarters we generated free cash flow of almost billion that also a record and a year to year increase of a billion and a at the uses of cash year to date we reduced our debt by over billion including billion this we also returned billion to shareholders billion was in dividends and billion in share repurchases this drove a reduction in average diluted shares of percent year to year and we had billion remaining from our board let turn to the balance sheet where we see the impact of our strong cash ended the quarter with a cash balance of billion that an increase of billion from the third quarter of debt was billion billion dollars of debt is in support of our financing business which is leveraged at two and a half billion dollars is debt is down from billion at year end and almost billion from a year ago and it down from its peak of almost billion in the middle of when we completed the accelerated share repurchase our strong cash flow has enabled us to afford this large debt reduction without impacting our cash reserves so we continue to have a very high degree of financial was percent down from percent in june and percent at year balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share improved mix and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded significant margin expansion in fact the benefit from a lower tax rate and share repurchase activity nearly offset the impact of our revenue so the real driver was our gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed cents of eps quarter with our earnings per share growth of percent we continued our second quarter momentum and improved our revenue leadership technology combined with our focus on delivering value to our clients resulted in share hardware we took share in system p system x blades disk tape and systems and technology software we took share in websphere information management tivoli and rational and total branded continued to expand margin and delivered strong profit growth through a combination of a higher value mix globalizing our operations and driving productivity across the transformational changes have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point generating more profit from each dollar of generated a lot of cash paid down billion of debt in the quarter and ended the quarter with billion of using our strong profit and cash flow to drive the investment needed to expand our base of opportunity organically and through acquisitions this month we added to our capabilities with the acquisition of strategic transformation of our business has allowed us to deliver strong performance in this environment but also positions us for the future with a much better business profile and more competitive cost the full year we are increasing our expectations for earnings per share to at least for the year that an increase of cents since july and earnings per share growth for the while it early to talk about expectations for with the current view of we certainly remain well ahead of pace to deliver our patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared i ask you

great year for ibm driven by continued margin expansion profit growth and cash generation all in an uncertain me start out by sharing a few financial systems we had substantial share gains in power points system x points blades points and storage point in software we had share gains in websphere tivoli and key branded middleware and in services we booked billion of services signings and billion for the year in outsourcing signings were up percent or percent at constant again we had great profit and margin performance this quarter pti grew percent we expanded margin and grew profit in every segment as we indicated in october we had profit growth in systems technology up percent for the year pti margin was up points led by services up over points software up over points and financing up over you put this all together we delivered eps of which is up percent and for the year up percent making this our seventh consecutive year of eps let me give you another perspective on may we established our roadmap with an eps objective for of to and with eps of in despite a challenging economy we got there one year early in we expect to deliver our eighth consecutive year of eps growth or at least of earnings per share for the year with consistent eps growth throughout the the first quarter we expect a to point improvement in ibm revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter at both actual rates and constant currency this would result in revenue growth at actual rates with software posting confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin grow profit generate cash return value to shareholders and return to revenue growth in before moving on to the details of the quarter i want to take a step back and talk about our performance over the longer financial performance that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since the last recession in let look at what we accomplished recession to we have added billion to our profit base our margin is up two and a half times our eps is up four times and cumulatively we generated about billion of free cash is the result of a dramatic transformation we started at the beginning of this decade it driven by a combination of shifting our business mix improving operating leverage through productivity and investing to capture growth take a look at these three impact on profit we have been remixing our business to move to the higher value exited commoditizing businesses while at the same time acquiring companies since for a total of almost billion these portfolio actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of services segments pti was billion and in it over billion our software profit growth is even more impressive in software segment pti was billion and in it also over billion that almost tripled in over percent of our segment profit came from software services and financing with software and services each contributing percent of our segment unique portfolio of businesses we built heavily weighted toward software and services generates high profitability and we continue to remix to higher value through organic investments and we had an ongoing focus on driving operating leverage through are leveraging our scale and global footprint to improve processes and productivity in a number of areas like support functions and service delivery in we yielded billion of cost and expense savings from the structural actions we taken along with mix this helped drive our point improvement in gross margin and percent reduction in operational expense for the year these actions are reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance point this will provide a real advantage as the spending environment improves with solid operating leverage off of our now leaner cost our strong margins and profitability enable us to make significant investments for have been investing to capture the opportunity in the emerging markets as these countries build out their public and private infrastructures in while the economic environment slowed globally our revenue growth in the growth markets remained points faster than the beeninvesting in capabilities that differentiate ibm and accelerate the development of new market opportunities areas like business analytics and cloud computing and smarter we invested almost billion in research and development to strengthen our technology week we announced that for the consecutive year we were in patents with over in that more than the total of microsoft hp oracle apple accenture and google combined and consistent with our shift in business mix about percent of our patent portfolio is for software and complemented our organic investments with acquisitions and one of our primary investment areas is business analytics which provides a solid platform for our smarter planet initiatives since we invested billion or and a half billion net in strategic acquisitions to build our business analytics capabilities these acquisitions delivered strong results in generating percent revenue growth at constant over the last decade we driven a significant transformation of our business and we continue to shift to higher value areas improve efficiency of our business and invest where we see the best long term of this positions us for growth as we move into i turn to the detailed financial results for the fourth start with a quick walk down the p l for the revenue was billion that up percent year to year and down percent at constant continued strong margin performance we increased income by percent and net income by percent gross margin expanded basis points due to better margins in services and systems our expense was better by percent year to year driven by actions we taken to continue to transform and globalize the business and focused expense management margin was up points year to year to percent an increase in our tax rate year to year income margin expanded points to finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year to year though it was up sequentially due to increased dilution because of the higher stock bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up percent from a year ago and i remind you that we had percent eps growth in the fourth quarter of last year so this is growth off of a very strong balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our strategy our liquidity position remains strong we finished the year with billion of cash on let me get into the fourth quarter details starting with revenue by by discussing the geo results as always i focus my comments on constant major market growth was consistent with the last couple of quarters in the fourth the uk had solid growth and sequentially we improved performance in canada and growth markets once again outpaced the major markets in the fourth quarter by points of revenue growth for the year the growth markets grew points faster and contributed percent of ibm geographic quarter the bric countries were up percent driven by growth in india brazil and china and for the full year china grew china we leveraging our broad portfolio to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients recently we announced one of the largest and most comprehensive consulting engagements to date in china where we helping to build smart across the see growing opportunity around the world much of which is outside the traditional it opportunity to help our clients drive efficiency in their physical and gross margin by to the results by segment i get into the specifics within each of the segment discussions but let me give you a snapshot of the revenue and gross profit total services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with third quarter and we had growth in both signings and software we gained share in key branded middleware we had a number of transactions that did close this quarter and we entering the first quarter with a very strong and technology growth improved again in the fourth quarter with share gains in most brands and particular strength in system all of our segments we had great margin performance our productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time this is the quarter of the last that we expanded our gross margin now that quite a let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total expense and other income was down percent and our ratio improved points year to expense reduction was driven entirely by operational expense which improved points year to year mitigating this improvement currency impacted expense growth by points and acquisitions by one been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity leveraging scale and our global footprint we focused on all areas of the business and this year we yielded billion of cost and expense savings from a number of initiatives such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce these actions reduce our cost base and make it more variable a lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point so as we return to growth we get better operating leverage off of our cost close out the discussion on spending as always i lay out the roadmap of items that had significant impacts to our accounts receivable provisionwas better by about million year to year driven by a lower level of additions versus last year our reserve coverage is flat year to year at we had a benefit of about million from investment transactions driven by a charge in the fourth quarter of related to an investment in a joint consistent with what we told you in october we had workforce rebalancing charges of about million in the quarter virtually all of it in europe these charges are down million from last year fourth profit growth our worse by million in the fourth quarter as we described last quarter we had a curtailment gain associated with a plan of about million we also had an unprecedented regulatory charge in germany let me with german pension plans are subject to mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage in the fourth quarter we received notification of a significant premium increase due to the level of insolvencies of in germany in this does not relate to the ibm plan it other companies plans in germany this premium increase resulted in an annual charge of almost million a impact of million in the quarter though the cash impact will be spread over five this quarter we had a large gain and an unanticipated offsetting charge in our costs neither of which is related to our operational the full year plans including this insolvency insurance charge cost about billion this is relatively flat me comment on the performance of our pension the plan return on assets was up percent for the year our plans which comprise about percent of our assets in aggregate were up percent so globally our pension plans were up percent for the forward we will hold our expected return assumption at percent and we will take our discount rate down to percent reflecting the current interest rate environment in with these assumptions together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions we expect cost and expense of about billion a increase of almost a funding perspective we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plans of billion our plan is fully funded and globally our qualified plans are percent funded so we made great progress in a comment on two other the change in currencies our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in fourth quarter as compared to a gain last year the impact in the fourth quarter was over million which is roughly half in expense and half in cost of goods tax rate was percent in the quarter up basis points year to year for the full year our tax rate was percent for we expect a tax rate in the range of to percent so fairly consistent on a now let turn to our segment by is a snapshot of both gross and margins by segment and as you can see the improvement is pti margin improvement of points was led by systems technology up points software up points and global financing up comment briefly on our global financing business we are emerging from a challenging credit environment with strong financial results in global financing our financing business remained focused on core competencies providing it financing to our ibm customers and business partners and delivered both gross profit margin and pti margin expansion this quarter and we ended the year with a return on equity of let turn to the segments starting with the fourth quarter the two services segments delivered strong margin performance and good growth in outsourcing signings to cap off a very strong the full year the combined services businesses delivered billion in income up percent year to year margin was up points to percent this improved margin was a result of the structural changes we made to services delivery over the past several years the global delivery capabilities we built proved to be dynamic and flexible enough to deal with very tough market backlog at the end of the year was billion up billion year to year and over billion delivered billion in new services business with outsourcing signings up percent at constant currency for the year outsourcing signings growth was broad based we grew across all major geographies the americas europe and asia and we grew in each of our outsourcing categories strategic outsourcing business transformation outsourcing and application we had very strong margin and signings performance in what was a difficult economic let me turn to the fourth quarter services segments delivered revenue of billion up percent at actual rates but down percent at constant signings were billion up percent at actual rates or percent at constant currency within that total outsourcing signings were up percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency and we signed deals greater than i go to the key drivers of performance in the two services technology services total gts signings were up percent at actual rates but down percent at constant currency gts outsourcing signings were up percent at actual rates down percent at constant currency for the year gts outsourcing signings at constant currency were up percent with major markets up percent and growth markets up technology services signings continue to be impacted by client deferrals and capital constraints however we have seen stability in the past two quarters in smaller transactions under technology services revenue in the quarter was billion up percent at actual rates or down percent at constant currency revenue trends in outsourcing should improve through as we start to see the benefits of signings in integrated technology services revenue performance largely reflects signings performance which continued to be impacted by declines in oem as we shift our portfolio to higher value technology servicesimproved gross margin nearly a point and margin basis points to the full year global technology servicesgross profit margins expanded in all lines of business and total margin was up strategic outsourcing we have improved gross margin for five consecutive years while improving overall service delivery quality we have accomplished this through a disciplined and innovative approach to delivery focused on both labor and productivity actions as you know we have been executing a strategy to deliver services out of key global delivery centers using consistent global delivery methods and processes we continuing to expand our capabilities with new centers in dubuque iowa cairo egypt and wroclaw poland we also improving labor utilization with analytics and by applying supply chain tools and techniques to our labor integrated technology services we improved margin by mixing toward more profitable based services and inbusiness transformationoutsourcing through improved deal selectivity and delivery to global business services signings were up percent at actual rates and percent at constant outsourcing signings were up percent at actual rates percent at constant currency and for the full year signings were up percent at constant currency this performance illustrates the strong value proposition that application outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost and systems integration signings were up percent at actual rates down percent at constant currency a significant improvement over third quarter this quarter small deal performance improved as the quarter progressed general business and distribution sectors grew and the growth markets were up percent at constant business services revenue was down percent at actual rates percent at constant currency while margin improved points to percent this was a record level of margin driven by strong utilization in our delivery centers good subcontractor resource management and spending management throughout the year this dynamic delivery model has enabled us to perform well in a tough economic climate and this quarter we saw some of the leverage our delivery model can provide with profit growth on lower we feel encouraged about the business as we saw improving trends in revenue margin and our two services segments did a great job delivering value and managing margin in a very challenging year we believe that our dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities are paying off it what enabled us to deliver on our profit objective of billion for the year and we are well positioned heading into with double digit outsourcing growth in backlog of billion improving trends in global business services and a delivery structure that has enabled us to perform exceptionally well in a tough to software revenue of billion was up percent year to year down percent at constant branded middleware grew percent and was flat at constant currency branded middleware gained share for the ninth straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market in fact it represented percent of our software revenue in the quarter that up points year to income was up percent and margin was up points year to year to percent and for the full year we delivered percent profit growth in software and expanded margin by points software delivered over billion of income nearly triple the profit in let me take you through the had another strong quarter growing percent or percent at constant currency and gained share business process management commerce and datapower product segments all grew double digits ilog which drives business rules management did very well again this quarter and contributed to websphere management software was up percent or percent at constant currency and held share business analytics continues to be a key growth area cognos posted strong growth and gained share providing a proof point on analytics demand in the market ibm acquisition of spss further strengthens our business analytics and optimization strategy by delivering predictive analytic capabilities that help customers drive better business outcomes infosphere warehouse which helps our customers turn information into a strategic asset also grew double grew percent or percent at constant currency and gained share enterprise asset management which is part of ibm smarter planet strategy grew over percent in emerging markets tivoli storage continued its robust growth as customers manage their rapidly growing storage data data protection as well as storage management grew double digits with based geography and sector software declined percent or percent at constant declined percent or percent at constant currency and held software faced a difficult compare against a very strong fourth quarter of last year we saw continued strength in the demand for software in the growth markets strong growth from our recent acquisitions and an increase in the volume of small deal activity in north america so all very encouraging signs there were a number of large deals however that did not close during fourth quarter and have contributed to a very strong first quarter opening pipeline and consequently we expect software to grow revenue double digits at actual rates in the first and technology and technology revenue was billion down percent at actual rates and percent at constant our revenue performance bottomed in the second quarter of the rate of decline has sequentially improved in each of the past two quarters we had strong growth in system x and blades and improved performance in microelectronics we gained share in system p system x blades and both disc and tape profit margins improved year to year in all brands and for systems and technology in total this quarter marks the highest gross profit margin for this business since fourth quarter of driven by improvements in our system x server business and converged and bottom line systems technology pretax profit grew percent year to year in the fourth z revenue declined percent year to year mips declined percent in the fourth quarter over the past two years mips grew percent compounded this is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle later this year we are releasing the next generation system system p revenue declined percent year to year and gained points of market share this is the seventh consecutive quarter of market share gains system p has gained share in of the last quarters in the fourth quarter our success with competitive unix displacements continued with almost competitive wins totaling nearly million in the quarter for the year we had over competitive wins which generated sales of over million later this quarter we introduce the next generation power systems which will deliver two to three times the performance in the same energy envelope so quite an announcement for this product x server revenue grew percent year to year taking points of share this is our fourth consecutive quarter of share gain our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance total system x blades grew percent year to year and we expect to gain points of share in revenue grew percent year to year but was down percent at constant currency disk grew percent and gained share disk growth was driven by strong growth in midrange and xiv in fact we added more than new customers to our xiv platform in the fourth quarter and since the acquisition tape declined percent but gained share again in fourth oem revenue was up percent year to year our fab is at near full utilization and our process output was sold out again this and technology closed out with improving revenue dynamics gross margin improvements in every brand and income growth of percent year to year and a margin of percent up points year to a performance for our hardware to our cash performance we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter down million year to the year our free cash flow was up million to billion this is our seventh consecutive year of free cash flow improvement was driven by growth in net income higher cash from sales cycle working capital and lower capex this was mitigated by higher i look at uses of cash for the year we reduced our debt by and a half billion and we returned billion to shareholders billion dollars of this was through dividends and we bought back almost million shares for billion including billion this quarter at the end of the year we had billion remaining from our last board to the balance sheet we finished with a substantial cash balance of billion cash is up billion from september and billion from last strong free cash flow enabled us to add to our cash balance while reducing our debt by almost billion from last total debt balance is now billion of this billion is in support of our global financing segment which is leveraged at to so our debt was billion down almost billion from a year ago as a result of the debt reduction and growth in equity our is now balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share quarter revenue growth contributed to our earnings ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed of the cents of eps also had a modest benefit from share repurchases but it was offset by a higher tax bridge to the year you can see the benefit of the shift to higher value areas and focus on driving efficiency in the spending base as margin expansion and expense productivity by far were the largest contributors to our earnings ongoing share repurchase program contributed another tax rate provided a very modest help of only in we delivered eps of our seventh consecutive year of earnings for was a great year in a tough environment all a result of the strategic transformation of our been shifting to higher value businesses this better positions us to meet client needs and drives a more profitable mix in software and services each contributed percent of our segment also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency our ongoing productivity initiatives have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point generating more profit from each dollar of revenue with a spend base of almost billion we got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more efficient this operating leverage will provide a real advantage as revenue performance improves in using our strong profit and cash base to drive the significant investment needed to expand our base of opportunity both organically and through acquisitions we positioned to capture the secular growth opportunity in the emerging markets and we investing in areas like our smarter planet solutions business analytics and new compute models such as cloud addition to supporting investments in growth initiatives and acquisitions our great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to return capital to shareholders this year we spent over billion on share repurchases and dividends and increased our dividend for the consecutive line the changes to the company have allowed us to deliver strong performance since and even over the last two years in a tough environment but more importantly the transformation has positioned us to come out even stronger in as i said earlier for the full year we expect eps of at least for the patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared i ask you to refrain

and focus on driving productivity again delivered solid margin and profit performance we increased margin by a point and both and net income were up percent we had great cash performance increasing free cash flow by million to billion we returned another billion to shareholders with million in dividends and billion of share repurchases the balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our full year objectives our liquidity position remains strong as we finished the quarter with billion of cash on hand this was a very good start to the key investments are unique to the ibm strategy and are paying quarter our growth markets were up percent year to year at constant currency led by the bric countries which were up percent as these countries build out and integrate their public and private analytics is one of the fundamental drivers of our software performance software revenue was up percent or percent at constant currency with share gains in each of the five middleware brands across software and services our business analytics revenue was up services an increasing portion of our consulting business is driven by our smarter planet engagements and business analytics this quarter consulting signings were up percent or percent at constant currency this is the strongest consulting performance in over three years so our growth initiatives helped drive our first quarter revenue growth rate may recall that in january we expected to improve our revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter to the first resulting in digit revenue growth at actual rates let me tell you how we did and give you a few first quarter revenue was up percent year to year though it was driven more by our business operations and less by currency with a strengthening dollar currency was less of a help only contributing points of growth the to points based on spot rates this impacted revenue by about million so our underlying business performance was better than improvement in revenue growth from the fourth quarter was broad based with improvements across each of our major segments and geographies in our segment performance systems and technology improved points software points global business services points and global technology services points all at constant geography americas revenue growth improved points emea points and asia points the major markets rate improved points and the growth markets points led by the in mind our solid annuity base so our transactional growth rates drove these so now after a very good first quarter we are increasing our earnings per share expectations for the year to at least which is up cents from our previous view of at least i turn to the detailed financial results for the first i just mentioned our revenue was up percent year to year to margin expanded basis points due to better margins in services and software and more favorable business mix our expense was up percent year to year within this our operational performance was better points but was more than offset by a point impact from currency and a point of acquisition expense margin was up a point year to year to percent and net income margin expanded nearly a point to percent with this continued margin expansion we increased both and net income by percent year to year and finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a percent reduction in our share bottom line we delivered of earnings per share up percent from a year i turn to the revenue details starting with a geographic by discussing the geographic results as always i focus my comments on constant i just mentioned the improvement in revenue growth was fairly consistent across our geographies with americas better by points europe better by points and asia by the point improvement in the major markets growth rate we had better performance in each of the countries the best growth again came from the uk which was up percent year to the growth markets growth accelerated as market conditions improved in most countries with percent growth this quarter growth markets outpaced the majors by points the growth was led by the bric countries which represent about a third of the growth markets the bric increase of percent included strong growth in brazil india and russia government spending and programs remains a tailwind in most countries and our strongest performance again came from the public sector within the growth markets our biggest improvement from fourth quarter was in sales to our small and medium business clients driven by growth in services power storage and system are having great success expanding our footprint in the growth markets which provides a base on which to build a software and services and gross margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment our services revenue growth improved from the fourth quarter in total and in so bto its maintenance and gbs this was driven by growth in outsourcing signings on a trailing month basis and growth in core consulting signings this software performance was excellent up percent targeted investments over the last several years have positioned us to capture growth in key areas like business analytics storage management and business quarter our systems and technology business returned to growth and we gained or held share in every to gross profit our improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time this quarter better margins in services and software and the relative strength of our software business resulted in gross margin expansion of basis let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total expense and other income was up percent and together with a percent increase in revenue our ratio improved points year to operational expense improved points year to year but it was more than offset by currency which impacted expense growth by points and acquisitions accounted for one point we continuing to execute initiatives to increase efficiency and drive productivity leveraging scale and our global footprint this strategy has worked well over the last five years and will continue to produce over the next always i lay out the roadmap of cost and expense items that had significant impacts to our in march we completed the sale of our plm operations to dassault and we booked a gainof about million in our call in january i mentioned that the gain from this sale would be relatively offset by a charge for productivity actions this quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about million the majority of the spending was in europe and asia and we expect payback by the end of the year with most of the benefit in the you recall in the first quarter of last year we had a gain of almost million associated with outsourcing our logistics business to geodis and this was effectively offset by our workforce rebalancing charges of million so a very similar dynamic with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges in fact when you look at the combined impact of the two unique items last year and two this year there is no impact on ibm performance in the first bad debt expense was less than million in the current period an improvement of about million from last year reflecting the improving credit environment our accounts receivable reserve coverage of percent is down basis points from last year though it is up slightly from year i comment on the impact from you know we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning the change in currencies this hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in the first quarter of this year as compared to a gain last year the impact in the first quarter was over million which is roughly percent in expense and percent in cost of goods sold keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigate the translation gains elsewhere in the p it difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions we do not believe that currency net of hedging activity contributed to our profit growth in the now let turn to our segment margins by is a snapshot of our margins by combination of the four unique items i just mentioned have no impact on ibm total results but they do impact the performance of the segments for example the workforce rebalancing activity this year was incurred in every segment but the plm gain was booked in provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the unique gains and charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the let turn to the segments starting with two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent year to year and down percent at constant currency this is a point improvement in growth rate at constant currency the fourth signings were billion down percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency if you exclude application management services signings signings would have been up percent i talk about our ams performance in a outsourcing signings were down percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency though strategic outsourcing signings were up percent as you know outsourcing signings can be very uneven by quarter and it important to look at the longer term trends total outsourcing signings on a trailing months basis are up percent at actual rates and up percent at constant transactional signings which include integrated technology services consulting and ams systems integration were down percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency in the quarter we did see a shift in demand toward our consulting offerings with consulting signings up we signed deals greater than million and backlog at the end of the quarter was billion up billion year to year or up billion adjusting for currency within the backlog we saw improved stability in our base accounts with backlog erosion at the lowest level in two i go to the key drivers of performance in the two services technology services revenue in the quarter was billion up percent year to year as reported and flat at constant outsourcing revenue improved in the quarter and returned to growth at constant currency reflecting demand for bto and strategic outsourcing over the last months in integrated technology services the revenue growth rate also improved from the fourth gtssignings were up percent at actual rates down percent at constant currency gts outsourcing signings were up percent at actual rates down percent at constant currency strategic outsourcing signings were up percent at actual rates with strong growth in north america integrated technology services signings were flat at actual rates down percent at constant currency the strongest performance was in the growth markets up percent year to year and we had improvement in services in north technology services gross profit was up percent year to year with margin up point total income was down percent year to year as we absorbed a significant increase in workforce rebalancing charges looking at a normalized view of gts margins excluding the items i discussed earlier pti would be up percent year to year with margin rebalancing activity will provide pti benefit mainly in the second half of the year and with this activity behind us we expect that gts will return to pti growth and margin expansion over the remainder of the to global business services revenue was flat as reported down percent at constant currency this improved revenue performance from fourth quarter was driven by strong growth in consulting signings which yield quickly in the quarter and revenue from application management services signings over the last gbssignings were down percent at actual rates down percent at constant currency this quarter i going to describe our signings performance for gbs the way we manage it as two distinct businesses consulting and application management services which includes both application outsourcing and systems consulting signings were up percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency this is the first quarter we had constant currency growth in consulting since the fourth quarter of we are starting to see a shift in customer buying patterns toward more transformational offerings which are reflected primarily in our consulting business we have reengineered this business to align with the strategy around smarter planet and business analytics making investments and adding significant getting good traction from our growth initiatives consulting signings in growth markets were up percent at constant currency and our smarter planet and business analytics offerings were percent of total consulting turning to application management services signings were down percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency versus a strong first quarter of last year where we had a handful of large deals this is where we came up short versus our expectations in the quarter ams signings were down million compared to last year now ams has grown on a trailing month basis but obviously it had an impact on our signings performance this quarter as i mentioned earlier services signings excluding ams would have been up business servicesgross profit margin expanded points this quarter to percent margin was down points year to year adjusting for the unique items pti margin was percent down point year to wrap up services we had good improvement in revenue performance driven by outsourcing signings growth in both gts and gbs over the past months and a return to signings growth in consulting this is important because consulting has been a good leading indicator and has the greatest impact on near term revenue performance both of these give us momentum going forward and we expect our services business to return to modest growth in the second had a terrific quarter with revenue of billion up percent year to year or percent at constant currency these results are a direct result of our sustained investment in this space organic investments complemented by strategic acquisitions have enabled us to deliver unique capabilities and tremendous value for our quarter key branded middleware grew percent or percent at constant currency and gained share for the tenth straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market every one of the key brands gained share we had very strong performance especially in our business integration analytics and storage management software this contributed to great brand performance with websphere up percent information management up percent and tivoli up software segment income grew percent or percent after normalizing for the unique items margin was up points year to year to percent normalized we improved margin points to let me take you through some additional detail on the had another strong quarter business integration offerings which deliver value to customers by enabling them to make their processes more predictive agile and collaborative grew over percent ilog which plays a key role in ibm smarter planet initiative by providing business rules management did very well again this quarter growing over management software had a great quarter business analytics continues to be a key growth area for us cognos which was our largest acquisition ever posted strong growth and gained share providing a proof point on analytics demand in the had an excellent quarter and gained share across all three market segments within systems management enterprise asset management which includes maximo products grew double digits this is a key component of our smarter planet strategy growth was broad based across geographies most notably in the growth markets storage management software also grew double digits which complements the strong growth in storage hardware we have had over consecutive quarters of growth in tivoli storage software finally security had solid growth driven by strong sales across the revenue growth improved significantly from the fourth quarter driven by percent increase in advanced collaboration this software improves our customers productivity by enabling the efficient sharing of software had a solid quarter with revenue growing percent year to year rational provides an integrated suite of products to manage the business process of software and systems quarter we completed the sale of our plm operations where we have acted as a sales channel our participation in this business has been declining for some time and this transaction is in line with our strategy to divest of lower value businesses the sale will have a positive effect on software margins immediately and improve our software revenue profile over time over the next year the loss of plm revenue will impact our software revenue growth by to points we will provide a view of our software revenue growth without plm for the next four quarters to better reflect our ongoing business had a great quarter reflecting the strength of the portfolio and the value it delivers to our customers we expect to continue the same level of revenue performance in the second quarter of course adjusting for the plm and technology and technology revenue was billion up percent year to year percent at constant currency this is an point sequential improvement in growth rates at constant gained share in storage both disk and tape system x which includes percent growth in blades retail store solutions and the of power which was driven by the introduction of power we held share in profit margins improved in storage system x retail stores and microelectronics systems and technology we expect mid constant currency revenue growth in the second quarter and our new products to help accelerate revenue growth through the second half to double digits by the fourth let me take you through more details on the systems revenue declined percent year to year and we held market share have been taking share in unix for years in first quarter our success with competitive unix displacements continued with over competitive wins totaling over million for the quarter this quarter we took share in both and systems in the midrange where we introduced power in february we gained better than points of share year to year power systems further extend our advantage others competing in the unix space we expect our share gains to continue in the when we announce our new power products later this revenue grew percent year to year disk grew percent and gained share with growth in enterprise and products in the growth was driven by xiv where we added new customers to our xiv platform in the first quarter tape declined percent but we again gained share our hardware storage results complement the strong performance in storage software our storage hardware and software together grew x server revenue grew percent year to year this was our fifth consecutive quarter of share gain in our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance system x blades grew percent year to year and gained points of share gross profit year to year driven by improvements in operational efficiencies and the strong performance in z revenue declined percent year to year mips declined percent in the first quarter after growing percent a year ago this performance is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle later this year we are releasing the next generation system oem revenue was up percent year to year our millimeter fab is at near full utilization and our nanometer output was sold out again this and technology returned to revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in system x storage microelectronics and retail store solutions i expect this growth rate to accelerate through to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow up million year to year the growth was achieved off of a strong first quarter of the increase in free cash flow was driven by higher net income and improved cash from sales cycle working capital as collections remain strong and we delivered this million increase in free cash flow even taking into account significantly higher tax payments so this was quite an the free cash flow line we received about million from the plm sale which is reflected in the investing section of our cash flow and on the line labeled other in this at our uses we completed five acquisitions for million which is a good start to the year and we returned billion to shareholders seven hundred million dollars was in dividends and billion was in share repurchases which helped drive a reduction in average diluted shares of just over percent we have billion remaining from our board this was a great quarter for cash flow especially for a first let turn to the balance sheet where we see the benefit of our strong cash after funding investment and returning cash to investors we maintained a healthy cash balance of billion which was flat from year end and an increase of billion from the first quarter of debt was billion over billion of debt is in support of our financing business which is leveraged at an appropriate to ratio four point one billion dollars is debt which is up million from year continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility in our model was percent up points from year end and down points from a year remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share quarter all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth starting with revenue which contributed cents of benefit or about of the total growth this was the largest contribution we had from revenue growth since the second quarter of our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed cents we also had a modest benefit from tax rate and share repurchase contributed another few our growth was delivered in a very balanced way through revenue growth profit expansion and an effective use of performance in the first quarter was driven by the investments we made to capture growth opportunities and our ability to deliver value to our had improvement in revenue growth across our segments and across our geographies this improvement together with a shift to higher value businesses and focus on driving productivity again delivered solid margin and profit took actions in the first quarter to continue to transform the company shifting to higher value areas and improving our structure we completed five acquisitions in the first quarter investing in key capabilities that support our growth initiatives we divested of our plm operations and after we get through the comparison in the next few quarters this will improve the revenue growth and margin of our software business we introduced new power offerings and will deliver power and mainframe systems later in the year to drive share gains in the second half and we continued to increase the productivity of the business these actions will improve our strategic position and our business model going what we see in the short term and our work with the business units we expect a return to revenue growth at constant currency in the second quarter with services delivering modest revenue growth hardware improving to digits and software continuing its strong confident in our ability to continue to improve our revenue performance

quarter we continued the trend of improving business performance increasing constant currency revenue growth expanding margin and once again delivering earnings per share now grown eps in each of the last quarters and since the beginning of our roadmap we grown eps at a rate in of the last revenue growth of percent was points better than our constant currency performance in the first quarter and points better than our fourth quarter growth rate our revenue growth would been about a point higher adjusting for the divested plm business so on this basis the improvement was broad based across all segments and all geographies including performance is driven by the investments we been making to capture growth opportunities and to deliver value to our clients we been investing heavily to build out the infrastructures in the emerging countries this quarter our growth markets were up percent or percent at constant currency led by the bric countries which were up sixteen percent at constant currency our performance in the growth markets has consistently outpaced the major markets and as a result for the first half of this year our business in the growth markets is now as large as our eurozone business for the first been investing to extend our technology leadership earlier this year we introduced technology to our unix servers and this quarter the midrange grew percent which resulted in points of share gain in power systems in the third quarter we have across our entire unix product line and will introduce and ship our next generation mainframe been investing in key growth areas such as business analytics our business analytics revenue was up percent which contributed to strong performance in both software and global business services global business services revenue growth improved to percent and software key branded middleware was up percent at constant currency and we took share again this quarter in been investing inacquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives in the first half we have closed acquisitions and announced another for a total of about billion these acquisitions add to our capabilities in areas such as industry solutions for smarter planet initiatives and business analytics and cloud this quarter we also continued to improve our profit profile expanding margin by a point and growing earnings per share by percent to and remember we delivered this profit performance compared to a strong second quarter of where we expanded margin by over points and grew eps by now based on our first half performance and our view of the second half we are increasing our expectations for the full year to at least of earnings per share that up from our view in april and up cents from let turn to the financial results for the quarter with a quick walk down the p delivered billion of revenue that up percent as reported and at constant currency we completed the sale of the software plm operations at the end of the first quarter this divestiture impacted ibm revenue growth by about a point and our software growth by about quarter we dealt with the sharp strengthening of the dollar the euro currency provided basis points of revenue growth as compared to the to basis points projected based on spot rates so that a to point impact to our revenue growth so the currency movements since april impacted second quarter revenue by about million and if you consider the currency movements since second quarter revenue was impacted by expanded gross margin driven by better margins in global business services and software our expense was down percent year to year our operational expense performance was points better mitigated by impacts from currency and acquisitions we increased income by percent and margin was up a point to percent our tax rate was down just over a point to percent in line with first quarter and our expected range for the full year net income improved percent and margin expanded nearly a point to percent and finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a percent reduction in our share bottom line we delivered of earnings per shar up percent from a year ago and while it certainly more difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions we estimate that currency including hedging activity impacted earnings growth by or cents per it important to note that we achieved this percent growth off of strong profit performance in second quarter and in the face of a significant currency headwind i address that in more detail in a few i turn to the revenue details starting with a geographic by discussing the geo results as always i focus my comments on constant substantial improvement in the growth rates from fourth quarter to first we again had an improving trend in revenue growth from the first to the second quarter across our geographies with the americas and asia pacific each better by points and europe better by a major markets also improved a point with the best growth again coming from the uk which was up a very strong percent and the us returned to growth for the first time in growth markets grew percent outpacing the majors by points in the bric countries which represent over of the growth markets revenue grew percent with growth in each of the countries our strong performance extended beyond the brics in fact we had growth in over countries this quarter up from in the first ongoing investments have positioned us to capture the fast growing opportunity in these markets and we been rapidly expanding our base of business as i mentioned earlier our growth markets business is now as large as our eurozone business and at this pace we expect our growth markets to be larger by the end of the by to revenue by segment our services business returned to revenue growth at constant currency led by an point improvement in global business services growth rate compared to the first software performance was excellent with key branded middleware up percent at constant currency and total software up percent excluding the divested plm are capturing growth in key areas like business analytics storage management and business integration this quarter our systems and technology business delivered growth as expected and we gained or held share in every on this basis similar to the geo performance we had improvement versus the first quarter growth rate in all segments at constant to expense our total expense and other income was down percent with a percent increase in revenue our ratio improved of a point year to year the expense decline was driven by operational expense improvement of points year to year but this improvement was mitigated by currency which impacted expense growth by points and acquisitions for another had an ongoing focus on increasing efficiency and driving productivity across the enterprise this is our eighth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement some of the savings from our productivity initiatives goes to the bottom line and some is reinvested back in the business as an example this quarter while overall sg a was down percent excluding currency and acquisitions sg a in the growth markets was up percent this is consistent with our investment profile over the last two years where our operational sg a spend for the growth markets was or more points higher than the want to mention just a couple of items that had significant impacts to our profit this quarter this quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were less than million down about million from the second quarter of last you look at the benefit in other income and expense remember that last year we had a charge of almost million related to an investment in a joint income also contains a significant portion of the impact from our hedge of cash flow programs as you know we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning our generated a gain this quarter it was as large as the gain last year the result is a impact to profit of over million which is roughly percent in expense and percent in cost of goods million hedging impact is about cents per share year to year we also estimate that we had a translation impact to our earnings growth of about cents so the total impact to the bottom line from currency is estimated at or cents now let turn to our segment by improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our margin over time this quarter software and global business services had great margin performance each up over a point our systems and technology margins declined due to mix of business and a higher level of investment to support our new product introductions this let turn to the segments starting with two services segments returned to growth at constant currency this quarter delivering billion in revenue up percent year to year as reported and up percent at constant currency this revenue performance was largely driven by global business services which improved its growth rate by points signings were flat sequentially at billion down percent year to year with global business services signings up percent at constant currency backlog remains steady at billion up billion adjusted for biggest driver of the signings decline was outsourcing down percent based on an assessment of our larger outsourcing contracts we had a significant decline in contract extensions as a number of large deals rolled out of the quarter contract extensions have little to no benefit to near term revenue in contrast we had good growth in new business signings which have a more immediate contribution to you look at the revenue that will be generated from these outsourcing signings we will actually get more revenue over the next months from this quarter outsourcing signings of billion than we did from last year second quarter signings of billion so the strength of new business signings in outsourcing contributes to an improving revenue trend for the rest of the year and shows why it important not to put too much emphasis on just the absolute signings to transactional signings which include integrated technology services consulting and ams systems integration signings were down percent again an improvement from first quarter at constant currency you can see improving performance in transactional signings over the past several quarters in our supplemental charts it shows a positive trend and good momentum as we move into the third quarter its growth improved from first quarter rates at constant currency and ams grew in consulting signings were up percent in north america and up in total for the first half although total consulting was down in the quarter as a number of deals rolled out of the we signed deals greater than million and as i said total services backlog at the end of the quarter was billion up billion adjusting for currency though down billion at actual rates and we had another quarter low backlog erosion now i go to the key drivers of performance in the two services technology servicesrevenue was billion up percent year to year as reported and flat at constant currency gts outsourcing revenue was up percent in the quarter and integrated technology services revenue was down percent we had good performance in the growth markets with revenue up over percent at constant currency in each of these technology services income was up slightly in the quarter with margin at percent with the benefit of the first quarter rebalancing activity coming in the second half of the year and a positive revenue growth trend we expect to expand margin in the second to global business services revenue was up percent both as reported and at constant currency we saw improved performance in many areas of the business as we grew revenue in both the major markets and the growth markets in all sectors with the exception of communications sector and in both consulting and ams where we had particular strength in north america with combined revenue up percent at constant currency from an offering perspective we had growth in both business analytics and smarter business services profit was up percent year to year with margin expanding points to percent this expansion was driven by higher utilization and benefits from the continued implementation of our globally integrated capabilities at the same time we are continuing to add to our skills base and invest for future wrap up services we saw a number of positive signs and improving trends in the quarter we had improvement in the revenue growth rate sequentially with a return to growth at constant currency for total services gbs revenue was up percent with points of improvement in the growth rate we had good recovery in ams signings we had very good new customer signings in outsourcing backlog was up billion year to year with a low level of erosion and we have a good pipeline of deals going into third this level of performance the total services revenue growth rate should improve in the second half this improvement will be led by gbs with its higher transactional content and with the benefits of the first quarter resource rebalancing we expect to see margin expansion in the second half as had another strong quarter of revenue performance with revenue of billion that up percent year to year or percent adjusting for the divestiture of plm which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing branded middleware grew percent at actual rates and percent at constant currency and gained share for the eleventh straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market the share gain was broad based across websphere information management tivoli and branded middleware accounted for percent of our total software revenue up points from this time last year both the websphere and tivoli brands grew at double digits year to year and we had strong performance in the business analytics product income was billion up percent year to year and margin improved points to percent this is the eleventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion in the software let me take you through the brands websphere had another excellent quarter growing percent and gained share in all segments with strong performance across the portfolio application servers which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for business applications grew percent business integration software which includes our ilog and lombardi acquisitions grew management also had a strong quarter growing percent information management software offerings provide the foundation for ibm business analytics and optimization had another terrific quarter in all market segments and grew percent in total enterprise asset management within the systems management portfolio grew double digits this continues to be a critical component of ibm smarter planet solutions in security software we had strength across the portfolio and in all geographies our tivoli storage products also continue to perform very well growing double digits and gaining share as an example xiv software which provides ease of use and lower total cost of ownership more than doubled and tivoli storage manager grew percent this quarter driven by its market leading data reduction capabilities and related cost breadth and diversity of our software portfolio combined with strategic investments in high growth areas have enabled us to achieve consistently strong results in the software segment we expect to deliver similar levels of revenue performance in the third and technology and was billion up percent year to year or percent at constant currency revenue was driven by continued growth in system x storage retail stores and had strong performance in the growth markets bric countries grew percent year to year with growth in all brands and we expect the strength in growth markets to continue in the second profit margin was down point driven by the third quarter we will announce new high end servers both the system z and power servers will be refreshed with availability in the middle of let me take you through more details on the brands power systems revenue declined percent year to year our new products drove growth of percent and power blade growth of over percent this performance drove our ninth consecutive quarter of share second quarter we had competitive unix displacements of which almost were from sun this resulted in million of business and nearly points of share gain this is a sequential increase of over million from the first quarter where we gained over seven points of share we have now won deals from sun totaling nearly million over the last quarters the win rate has been increasing and we expect these to continue throughout the second quarter we will announce our entry and systems with availability in september our systems will scale up to cores and are capable of running virtual images which is times more than our current processors additionally the energy efficiency of these new high end systems will be five to seven times more efficient than the latest unix systems from both sun and revenue grew percent year to year disk revenue grew percent or percent at constant currency driven by continued strength in offerings xiv and xiv added more than new customers to the platform in the second quarter and revenue more than doubled year to x revenue grew percent year to year led by our high volume offerings and system x blades x blades grew percent year to year the high end of system x was up percent and gained share this performance combined with the growth in blades and improvements in operational efficiencies contributed to improved gross profit margin performance in system z revenue declined percent year to year this week ibm will announce the next generation of system z the fastest and most scalable enterprise server in the industry this server provides percent more performance on a mix of workloads than the equivalent some workloads can achieve greater performance improvements such as linux which has percent better performance and percent lower cost this announcement is the foundation for ibm first system of systems which provides the capability to manage times the virtual machines of vmware by extending mainframe governance to our other industry leading oem revenue was up percent year to year both our millimeter and millimeter fabs are fully and technology continued its revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in disk storage system x microelectronics and retail store solutions and with the introduction of new systems in third quarter i expect this growth rate to improve in the third and the fourth quarters and to deliver income growth for the second half of the to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter which was down million year to year driven by higher capital investments of million in support of hardware product announcements as well as a prior year foreign tax refund of the first half our free cash flow of billion was flat year to year we had strong operating performance driven by higher net income of million and sales cycle working capital improvements of million year to was offset by higher capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology and a impact of over million for unique tax refunds as previously disclosed excluding these unique tax refunds free cash flow would have been up at the uses of cash in the first half we spent a billion dollars for acquisitions in support of our growth strategy the largest of these were national interest security nisc initiate systems lombardi and cast iron addition we returned almost billion to the shareholders in the first half billion was in the form of share repurchases and we have about billion remaining from our last board authorization we took our dividend up percent in april and paid out billion in dividends this is the fifteenth consecutive year that we raised our dividend and we more than tripled our dividend over the last let turn to the balance sheet where we see the impact of our cash ended the quarter with a cash balance of billion more than of which was in the us our collections remain debt was billion million dollars of debt was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at to five point five billion dollars was debt that was down from billion a year was percent up from percent in december and down from percent a year ago with this level of leverage we continue to have a high degree of financial balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance this quarter all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth our revenue growth at constant mix and margin contributed a nickel the largest contributor was operating leverage driven by gross margin expansion improving expense productivity and a improvement in the tax rate and a percent reduction in share count contributed once again our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth margin expansion and an effective use of cash and while it not uniquely identified in the bridge we overcame a currency headwind of to cents on our way to percent earnings per share for the last several years we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth since early when we first introduced our roadmap we delivered eps growth each year and in of the last quarters compared to the dow ibm is the only company to have positive growth in each of the last each of these periods which spanned a variety of economic environments we faced unique opportunities and challenges there are many dimensions of ibm business model from business mix to global scale and structure to financial strength and flexibility that have allowed us to overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities while we consistently quarter we dealt with a significant currency headwind caused by the sharp strengthening of the dollar and still delivered percent earnings per share growth against a very strong second quarter of last year which had percent eps while some companies will show growth this quarter as they recover from their losses in the recession ibm is building on our strong performance over the last continued our steady improvement in the business in both revenue growth and margin expansion and we used our strong profit and cash position to invest and expand our base of opportunity while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share forward to the second half we have exciting new product introductions with our new mainframe system of systems and technology across our power systems product line we continue to leverage investments in our growth initiatives smarter planet business analytics and growth markets we integrate the acquisitions announced this quarter we yield the benefits from our first quarter workforce rebalancing actions and we continue to drive efficiencies and increase productivity all while continuing to invest in innovation throughout the business all of this supports our expectation of at least of earnings per share for the patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of we have supplemental charts at the end of

shareholder growth of percent at constant currency was up points from our second quarter growth rate continuing the trend of improving business markets had a great quarter up percent at constant currency we been investing to expand into new regions and build out it infrastructure in support of economic growth systems and technology had its best revenue growth in six years up percent and profit was up percent capitalizing on new product introductions and continued strong growth in system x midrange power and storage we had good growth in global business services revenue was up percent year to year our transactional signings returned to growth and we been investing in resources in key opportunity areas like business analytics across ibm which includes services and software business analytics revenue was up percent year to we delivered billion of revenue that up percent as reported and percent at constant once again we had good profit and margin performance we expanded gross margin by basis points driven by better margins in software and systems and technology our expense was up percent year to year underneath this our operational expense performance was better by a point we increased income by percent and margin was up basis points to percent our third quarter tax rate reflects an updated view of the full year rate to percent our net income was up percent and margin expanded over a point to percent finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a reduction in our share count of of this contributed to earnings per share of up percent from a year ago we now had consecutive quarters of eps on this performance and our view of the fourth quarter we are increasing our expectation for the full year of to at least of earnings per share that up cents from our previous view of at least in july and represents a percent increase over i turn to the revenue details starting with a geographic view where i focus my comments on constant by again had an improving trend in revenue growth rate from the second to the third quarter across our geographies with the americas better by a point europe by points and asia pacific by the major markets we significantly improved the growth rate in canada france germany and italy and continued our strong performance in the so we encouraged by what we seeing in several of the major market countries the growth was consistent with second quarter levels and japan posted very modest growth for the first time in i mentioned in the opening our growth markets had terrific performance up percent which outpaced the majors by points the combined revenue in the bric countries was up percent with strong growth in each of the four countries brazil was up percent russia percent india up percent and china up few years ago we established a play to capture the opportunity in the growth markets and our investments are really paying off we have three growth strategies that are aimed at creating new markets now you may recall that bruno di leo our general manager of the growth markets discussed these at our investor briefing in may and i want to spend a minute describing our results this quarter in the context of these market expansion which is about reaching new clients and new enterprises expanding into new countries and into new territories we prioritized countries for investment beyond the brics together with the brics the growth markets grew percent this quarter and we had countries within the growth markets that grew double digits historically the vast majority of the revenue within these countries came from relatively few cities to increase coverage in new territories we have a systematic approach to opening branch offices in new cities while leveraging the global infrastructure year to date we have opened branch offices bringing our total to in the growth markets this quarter the fastest growth came from these new expansion second strategy is it infrastructure development in support of economic growth each year tens of millions of people are moving from rural areas into cities this creates a demand for banking telecommunications transportation and energy our strategy is to provide the it that supports the of this infrastructure that means systems software solutions and large services projects now here are a couple of examples of the kind of work we doing in china ibm and peking university people hospital have built an care system to enable resource sharing among service providers for improved patient care and in india ibm has delivered to keonics a education solution to enable the government client to offer a more sophisticated advanced technical curriculum to their corporate clients we seeing the benefit of the it infrastructure work in our systems results this quarter we had percent growth in total systems and technology with almost percent in servers this led to share gains in systems and technology as well as our growth markets third strategy is to develop industry leadership in selected industries which we believe are most relevant in the growth markets banking energy utilities healthcare transportation rail and natural resources we been investing in industry specific skills by both hiring and deepening our employee skill sets in the third quarter we had percent combined growth in these industries and growth in four of the five with this strategy and the making we expect performance in the growth markets to continue to outpace the major markets and to continue to grow faster than the market by to revenue by segment as expected the services business continued to improve its revenue growth rate at constant currency the biggest lift came from global business services the growth rate is up points from second quarter to percent growth in the third global technology services which has a higher percentage of long term annuity content improved to software growth was in line with last quarter software grew percent at constant currency excluding the divested plm operations a view that best represents our ongoing business software growth continues to be led by key areas like business analytics storage management and business strongest growth came from our systems and technology business up percent our system z mainframes were up percent capitalizing on a new product introduction and strong performance in the growth markets midrange power had growth storage had growth in disk and system x once again posted very strong get into more detail when we discuss the to expense our total expense and other income was up percent with a percent increase in revenue our ratio improved a half of a point year to expense increase was driven entirely by acquisitions which drove a point increase we been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives such as business analytics and cloud computing through the third quarter we closed acquisitions for a total of about billion this higher level of acquisition expense was mitigated by currency which improved expense by one finally we had a point improvement in operational expense with our ongoing focus on driving more productivity and efficiency in our spending base this is now our ninth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement underneath this we been increasing investment in several areas i give you a few examples we investing in industry sales skills to support smarter planet we building sales capabilities for business analytics and have established eight analytics solution centers around the world we investing in development sales and marketing to support our new high end technology introductions and we continuing to deploy sales resource and build sales enablement to drive growth market performance this quarter the sg a in the growth markets excluding currency and acquisitions is up percent year to year while overall ibm is flat bottom line we been able to drive a higher level of investment in these initiatives while still expanding wrap up the expense discussion this quarter there are no items that provided significant impacts or benefits to our profit the change in other income and expense is driven by the combination of charges in the third quarter of last year for investment losses and a gain this quarter associated with the disposition of a joint venture none of these items are material significant gains or losses from our hedging programs either in the period or year to before turning to the segment discussions we got a snap shot of our margins by by again our margin expansion was both services segments improved profit margin software gross margin was up a point and margin was flat at percent systems and technology expansion was driven by improvements in microelectronics and storage and global financing margin improvement reflects the interest rate environment and higher margin on equipment now moving on to the segment details the two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent at constant currency global business services grew percent at constant currency and global technology services grew percent at constant currency both segments had sequential improvement in their constant currency revenue growth rates versus second quarter and both segments grew income and expanded margin year to signings were billion up percent this was driven by global business services which was up percent outsourcing signings were billion down percent at constant currency including a deal we signed on october we would have reported outsourcing growth of percent at constant currency and this would have increased the total signings reported from billion to billion it very difficult to predict precisely when these deals will close eight days is not going to make any difference in the yield to this contract which kicks in quickly in the fourth was billion with a very low level of erosion this is up billion from the second quarter and flat year to year at actual rates at constant currency backlog is also flat year to year and down billion quarter to quarter this quarter we signed ten deals over let move on to

revenue growth both as reported and at constant currency expansion of gross and net margins and earnings per share of up percent year to year this represents our consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth the only dow component with that record and we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter up a billion and a half year to revenue growth of percent was the best constant currency revenue growth in almost a decade driven by hardware and software systems and technology was up percent at constant currency with growth in every platform and particularly strong performance in our system z mainframe our software revenue was up percent at constant currency without the divested plm operations as i said back in october our total services revenue growth rate was in line with the third quarter our total services backlog ended the year at billion at constant currency that up billion year to year and up billion since september from a geographic perspective our major market revenue growth was percent at constant currency led by the france and italy our growth markets revenue was up percent at constant currency business analytics another of our key growth initiatives was up with strong revenue growth we had great profit and margin performance while continuing a high level of see this in our financial expanded gross margin by eight tenths with increases in systems and technology and expense was up percent year to year in line with revenue growth the increase was driven by acquisitions over the last months and higher expenses associated with our strong revenue performance as well as investments in capacity for ongoing increased income by percent and margin was up over basis points to net income was also up percent and net margin expanded to over our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a percent reduction in our share you put this all together we delivered eps of which is up percent year to year for the full year our eps was up percent making this our eighth consecutive year of eps strong earnings performance drove billion of free cash flow up billion year to year and consequently we ending the year with a very strong balance sheet including billion of cash most of which is in the earnings presentation want to put this performance in the context of our roadmap i then take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and wrap up with our eps roadmap may in we established our earnings per share roadmap to this is the chart i showed at our investor meeting in may of when we introduced the roadmap in that meeting we presented an eps objective of to in addition to the eps target we provided an analysis of the key factors driving earnings growth from to eps roadmap at the end of the roadmap period we delivered of earnings per share well above the high end of the range of to let me go through the major the pressure on revenue given the recession we relied on other elements of our model to achieve the objective we worked on our cost and expense structure continuing to globalize our business we continued to improve our mix of business and we generated a lot of cash which allowed us to acquire key capabilities and to return significant value to shareholders so we delivered the results with margin expansion acquisitions and share we said at the time that the improvement in pension would be what it would be due to the variability of market returns and discount we were able not only to achieve but to exceed the roadmap objective due to the resilience of our business eps roadmap annual at our progress by year we had consistently strong performance in eps with growth every eps of we beat the low end of the target by and the high end by cents which is even more impressive when you consider we had to deal with a severe of ibm business fact ibm performed better than others over the last few years and this resulted in superior returns to investors over the roadmap business results since significantly outperformed those of the s p if you compare our eps growth to the s p you can see that ibm growth rate is percent while the earnings of the s p was when you look at total return on the stock which includes share price plus dividends we cumulatively returned percent or billion of shareholder value since the end of while an investment in the s p resulted in a modest performance is the result of a transformation we started at the beginning of this decade we been shifting our business to higher value areas improving productivity and investing to drive future growth the changes to our business are pretty dramatic i give you a couple of capture the opportunity in emerging markets we created a dedicated management system and have been investing to drive market expansion and infrastructure development since we added billion in annual revenue from our growth markets and with these markets consistently outpacing the more established major markets the revenue contribution from the growth markets has increased significantly to percent in all of ibm we have been shifting to higher value areas while divesting commoditizing business these actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of business in services segments pti was billion and in it over billion our software profit growth is even more impressive in software segment pti was billion and in it over billion that more than tripled and software now contributes percent of our segment profit up from percent in you look at ibm financial results since we have added billion of income nearly tripled eps and generated billion of free cash flow over the strong profit and cash generation have allowed us to invest in the business while delivering significant shareholder returns over the last ten years we invested almost billion in r d as well as billion of gross spend to acquire companies adding to our capabilities in high value areas like business analytics and smarter planet at the same time we returned billion to shareholders almost billion through share repurchases and we increased our dividend five fold since marks the end of a very successful decade the changes we made over the last ten years have strengthened our business and position us well to deliver over the next five earnings presentation let me get into the fourth quarter details starting with revenue by by percent revenue growth we had strong performance in major markets and growth markets i focus the geo comments on constant markets revenue was up percent driven by the and southwest europe the our largest market was up percent this is the strongest growth in years with improvements across our businesses europe performance was led by growth in france and solid performance in i mentioned in the opening our growth markets had terrific performance up percent for the full year the growth markets were up percent and outpaced the major markets by points faster than we saw in both and the combined revenue in the brics was up percent with growth in each of the four countries and particularly strong growth in china which was up percent and russia up percent our growth markets performance was with growth in growth market countries up from last quarter we picked up share in hardware and software and gained share in growth markets by to revenue by segment as expected the total services growth rate was consistent with the third quarter so the improvement in our revenue growth was driven by the hardware and software transactional and technology had fantastic performance with percent growth we had growth in every platform but the most impressive growth was in our system z mainframes which were up almost software growth was also very strong up percent excluding the divested plm operations a view that best represents our ongoing business software growth continues to be led by key areas like business commerce systems management and business get into more detail when we discuss the total expense and other income was up percent in line with our revenue in acquisition expense contributed points of the expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up points driven by a higher level of expense to drive this quarter strong revenue performance and investment in capacity to support future i comment on a couple of items that had larger impacts to our workforce rebalancing charges were better by about million year to year in the first quarter of we expect a gain on an asset sale which will be largely offset by workforce rebalancing predominantly in europe though we expect restructuring charges to be down year to second with the change in currencies our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss of about million in the quarter in cost and expense as compared to last year loss of over million we estimate that the total help to the bottom line from currency between translation and hedging is about cents year to year in the quarter but a hurt to full year eps of about now let turn to our two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent global business services grew percent and global technology services was up backlog was billion at constant currency this is up billion year to year and billion quarter to quarter backlog for our outsourcing businesses which is the primary driver of outsourcing revenue was billion up billion year to year and billion quarter to quarter excluding signings were billion up percent with transactional signings of billion up percent and outsourcing signings of billion up percent this quarter we signed deals over let move on to the two technology services revenue was outsourcing revenue was up percent revenue was driven primarily from existing backlog though this quarter we had an increase in revenue from our base accounts which was the first quarter of base growth since the fourth quarter of we see customers starting to spend more in their base business as we exit the recession the increase in outsourcing backlog was due to significant demand for our offerings in the growth markets as we help our clients build out their it technology services revenue growth improved from previous quarters as we continue to have good performance in the growth technology services income was up percent and margin expanded to to global business services revenue was up percent to billion we delivered growth in outsourcing and in our transactional businesses both consulting and systems integration we gained share for total gbs with gains in consulting and sustained share in application management a geographic perspective our best performance was in north america which was up percent at constant currency from a sector perspective growth was led by distribution financial services industrial and general we continued to have good performance in our growth initiatives in gbs with business analytics revenue up over percent now added over consultants in and now have over dedicated consultants in our business analytics business services margin was percent as we continued to invest in globally integrated capabilities and skills to support growth services moving from services let me spend a minute on the drivers of revenue in our services businesses first i focus the discussion on the outsourcing businesses which are just under half of services revenue and includes strategic outsourcing business transformation outsourcing and application outsourcing then i move on to the transactional had a great quarter in outsourcing signings up percent on a dollar basis that double our third quarter signings so very strong performance but also a good example of signings volatility or unevenness by included a chart that shows outsourcing revenue and signings growth for the last three years as you can see outsourcing signings are very volatile and certainly not a good predictor of revenue this is due to the many factors that impact how signings ultimately translate to revenue such as duration start date new the bottom of the chart you can see outsourcing backlog over the same period this backlog has been very stable with characteristics more similar to revenue it primarily the composition of contracts within the backlog that drive revenue better understand that composition and the impact on revenue over the next year we have taken a look at how that backlog runs out over time the biggest driver of next year outsourcing revenue is in fact the backlog that we enter the year backlog run the next chart you see that a high percentage of outsourcing revenue came from the backlog that we started the year with most of the remaining revenue came from new business we sold into our existing accounts and a much smaller portion from new client signings although these factors can change year to year the general characteristics are consistent over if you look at our outsourcing backlog at the end of the revenue that we expect to come from backlog in is in fact up percent year to year so we have very good visibility into a large component of next year services i will turn to the transactional businesses which are just over a third of services revenue and include integrated technology services and consulting and systems integration as you can see in the chart when you look at the combined transactional businesses the revenue growth and signings growth are very similar within a help investors better understand the services revenue drivers our plan is to report the outsourcing backlog as a discrete metric each quarter and then next year update the outsourcing backlog run out and we will begin reporting the transactional and outsourcing revenue components of global businesses services which gives you better insight into had a very strong quarter revenue of billion was up percent or percent at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of plm which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business our revenue is up percent or percent at constant currency this is double the

drove the majority of the working capital a full year basis we generated billion of free cash flow which is growth of billion over last year we invested billion in capital expenditures up million from last year in support of new hardware products and semiconductor technology and remember our full year free cash flow growth was significantly impacted by million year to year due to unique tax refunds as disclosed in previous i look at uses of cash for the year we spent almost billion in acquisitions that net spending up billion from last year this includes billion of spending in fourth quarter to acquire netezza unica blade network clarity systems open pages and pss systems so a very strong end to the addition we returned billion to shareholders including billion in the form of dividends up from billion in and we bought back almost million shares for billion at the end of the year we had billion remaining in our buyback to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a cash balance of billion up million from third debt was billion of which nearly billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at seven to one so our debt was billion up million from third quarter and up billion from a year ago at these debt levels was percent up from percent a year ago with this amount of leverage we continue to have a high degree of financial balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long bridge to wrap up the discussion of the fourth quarter with a summary of the drivers of our earnings per share quarter percent revenue growth made a strong contribution to our earnings growth cents year to leverage in this case driven by gross margin expansion added lower share count contributed bridge to the full year operating leverage was the largest contributor to our earnings growth though we had good contribution from both revenue growth and share in we delivered eps of our eighth consecutive year of earnings per share was a very good year for us we improved revenue performance over the course of the year and as you would expect our transaction businesses led the improvements our growth initiatives also provided good relied on productivity initiatives to drive margin improvement above the model level with and net margins each up basis the year we continued to invest for innovation this supported the introduction of our new system z mainframes and products we invested billion to acquire companies adding significant capabilities to support our growth generated a lot of cash over billion and we returned over billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and overall a strong year capping off a strong earnings presentation now we move on to the roadmap we going to go through this in a lot more detail in our investor meeting in early to operating start with the transition to operating earnings our new reporting format we introduced this at our investor meeting back in may of and since then provided supplemental information on this view in our second and third quarter earnings reports and at the end of august we published quarterly history for and we did that to give investors time to adjust their models before the beginning of providing expectations for operating eps today and starting with our first quarter reporting in april we will increase the focus on operating earnings in our earnings introduced this new view of the business because we believe operating earnings provides better transparency to our operating results and because we separately reporting the elements of pension we provide more insight into our pension performance as well i update you on our view of pension in just a believe that operating earnings also provides better comparison to our tech peers and by removing the element of pension allows us to provide a better long term view of the our operating eps was that excludes the charges of cents and excludes pension which was income of cents per share the net difference between gaap and operating eps for is is the base or the starting point for our roadmap want to be clear that starting in operating earnings is the way we running the business as we drive for at least of operating eps in our management decisions will support operating earnings the business units are driving for operating earnings our compensation is tied to operating earnings which include the pension and charges will vary over time for example at current pension assumptions in the early years gaap eps growth will lag operating eps growth but in the later years of the roadmap gaap growth will be see these dynamics in the pension charges operating let me spend a couple of minutes on pension to give you an update on the operating and performance i using the same format we used at the may investor start with operating cost which consist of service cost and defined contribution cost as we showed you in may these costs are relatively stable at just under billion per year the corresponding cash is also stable through costs are included in our operating earnings definition as they are labor costs associated with running our charges i turn to the elements which are primarily those related to changes in plan assets and liabilities and are most dependent on discount rate movements and return on assets from a financial perspective we focused on the cash balance sheet and funding implications not the i e so funded status is very the end of our defined benefit tax qualified plans were well funded with our plan fully funded at percent consistent with december and our global plans at percent there are a number of factors that contribute to volatile market conditions global asset returns were strong at almost percent this is the second consecutive year of strong performance looking forward we take our average expected return assumption to percent and reduce our discount rate to percent reflecting the current interest rate these market dynamics have generated some impact to cost cost over the longer term has improved with actually better than discussed in may while cash as you can see remains relatively now expect pension to be down million year to year this is million more of an impact than we showed you in may due to the decline in discount rates in over the roadmap based on assumptions we now expect about million of income from pension in this is better than what we showed you in may by million due to strong asset what is really important is cash and despite the volatility in the gaap i e cash remains stable to improving over time cash requirements are million better than we showed in may with charges you can see clearly the impact on gaap earnings verses the cash requirements based on year end assumptions pension will impact gaap earnings growth through but starting in this reverses and pension would benefit the gaap earnings growth so by pension returns to an income to the p l but as i said there is very little impact on cash in fact the cash requirements would be stable through and improve slightly by so much more stable over line we are managing our business to drive operating earnings over the long term and from a financial perspective we focused on the cash and balance sheet implications for pension assets and let summarize our new roadmap with an objective of at least of operating earnings per share in as in our last roadmap we identified the major drivers of performance revenue growth operating leverage and share revenue growth comes from a combination of base revenue growth a mix to faster growing businesses and acquisitions closed between and the operating leverage will come from both shift to higher margin businesses and enterprise productivity we driving for billion of productivity over the next five years part will go to our bottom line and part to drive competitiveness in the marketplace and we continue to return value to shareholders with billion of share repurchase and billion of dividends overall you see that we expect fairly balanced contribution from revenue growth operating leverage and share just as in the roadmap we relying on the resilience of our business model to drive the overall objective of at least of operating transformation will be our first step toward this objective we enter the year with a strong portfolio of offerings momentum in our key growth initiatives a solid operating model and a strong financial expect to deliver operating eps of at least for the year which at percent growth is right on track to achieve at least of operating earnings in patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared i ask you to refrain from we conclude the q a i turn the call back to mark for final please open it up for End_of_report 20110127 REPORT amendments to articles of incorporation or bylaws change in fiscal

about percent so we have continued strong performance in services with this performance we gained share in hardware software and total services and in growth markets while we discussing our geographic results i want to spend a minute on japan we have percent of our revenue in japan with the bulk of our business in services which is predominantly and so tends to be more stable through various market conditions looking at the dynamics in the quarter we had some deterioration in march but it really was that different than what we saw through february so we did not see a big change in the trajectory of the business our employees did a great job working with our clients in a very challenging environment and i want to congratulate them on their tremendous and gross profit margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment the total services revenue growth rate improved to percent or percent at constant currency global technology services led the improvement with higher revenue from backlog and growth from our existing accounts systems and technology again had powerful performance with almost percent growth we had strong growth in every platform all were up at actual rates the most impressive growth was in our high value systems system z mainframes were up percent and power was up almost percent as we continue to displace competitive systems our software growth was also very strong up percent or percent at constant currency both excluding the divested plm operations growth was led by business analytics storage management and business integration and netezza is off to a great to gross profit our operating gross profit margin improved basis points led by systems and software the largest contribution came from systems and technology driven by improvements in every systems brand and an improving mix we also expanded gross margin in software global business services and global let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was up percent in line with our revenue growth the increase was driven by acquisitions over the last months which contributed points of the increase this is an assessment of our operating expense and so excludes the impact of amortization base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up points driven by a higher level of expense to support this quarter revenue i comment on a few items that had larger impacts to our profit first we had investment gains associated with asset sales in the quarter which totaled about million in our call in january i mentioned that the investment gains would be relatively offset by a charge for workforce rebalancing actions this quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about million with the majority of the spending in europe and if you recall in the first quarter of last year we had a gain of almost million associated with the sale of our plm operations to dassault and this was effectively offset by our workforce rebalancing charges of million so we had a very similar dynamic with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges now in fact when you look at the combined impact of the two unique items last year and the two this year there is minimal impact on ibm performance in the first quarter though it does impact the segment income by is because the workforce rebalancing activity in both years was incurred in every segment but last year plm gain was booked in software and the investment gains this year were primarily booked above our segment provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing last year plm gain and workforce rebalancing charges from both years this gives you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments you can see that our profit and margin performance is with strong profit growth in every let get into the two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent as reported and up percent at constant currency global technology services grew percent as reported and global business services grew percent as reported both were up percent at constant currency looking at a different cut of the revenue total transactional revenue was billion up percent or percent at constant currency and total outsourcing revenue was billion up percent as reported and percent at constant quarter we showed you a chart that described the revenue dynamics of our outsourcing businesses we included that exact chart again as reference and you can find it in our supplemental charts we described how roughly percent of our annual outsourcing revenue comes from the backlog at the beginning of year with the remaining percent coming predominately from new sales into our existing client base and a very small fraction coming from new signings we saw those dynamics reflected in the outsourcing results this quarter revenue from backlog was up over percent and revenue from sales into our existing base accounts was up as well driving total constant currency outsourcing growth of backlog was billion up billion year to year and up a billion and a half dollars excluding currency as we discussed the past few quarters backlog is a more stable and comprehensive metric with performance characteristics more similar to revenue especially for outsourcing this quarter backlog growth was driven by an increase in the opening backlog lower levels of erosion growth in our base accounts and let move on to the two technology services revenue was billion gts outsourcing revenue was up percent as reported and percent at constant currency revenue growth at constant currency improved by points over last quarter this was driven primarily by increased revenue from backlog and growth in business in our strategic outsourcing base accounts growth markets continued to drive strong performance with revenue up percent year to year at constant technology services revenue grew percent as reported and percent at constant currency here too its was up percent at constant currency in the growth technology services income normalized for the workforce rebalancing charges in both years was up percent with a half point of pti margin to global business services revenue was billion starting this quarter we will provide the outsourcing and transactional revenue elements for global business services we believe this will give you better insight into our revenue dynamics application outsourcing revenue which was just over percent of gbs revenue was up percent as reported and percent at constant currency and consulting and systems integration which includes consulting ams systems integration and the federal business grew percent as reported and percent at constant a geographic perspective we had good performance in gbs in north america which was up percent at constant currency from a sector perspective growth was led by distribution general business and communications and we continued to have strong performance in our growth initiatives in gbs with business analytics revenue up over business services normalized was up a very strong percent with a point and a half of margin expansion

sterling commerce unica and coremetrics were also strong contributors to websphere management had another good quarter up percent business analytics software was up double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter our distributed database had an outstanding quarter with growth in our base business complemented by exceptional performance by netezza netezza transactional volumes are up percent

held share tivoli storage grew percent driven by over percent growth in software for software grew percent year to year in the first quarter rational products grew percent year to year the fifth consecutive quarter of growth over delivered income of billion and margin over percent pti is up percent normalized for the prior year gain on the sale of plm to dassault as well as charges for

margin up seven and a half flow to cash flow we generated million of free cash flow in the quarter which is down million year to year the decline is driven entirely by an million increase due to income tax settlement payments excluding the impact of tax payments free cash flow would have been up about million year to addition we continued to invest in our business to drive future growth net capital expenditures were up million year to year in support of new services contracts and investments in semiconductor tools our inventory continues to be well managed and collections were at the

year to this performance we are increasing our full year expectation for operating earnings per share to at least which is up cents from our previous view of at least and up cents from the beginning of the percent revenue growth was driven by our transactional businesses in hardware and software software growth was driven by key branded middleware which was up percent our systems revenue was up percent with strong performance in system z power and system x servers in services our total backlog increased to billion that up almost billion from last year with billion from currency and billion of constant currency performance services revenue was up percent within this growth markets were up percent or percent at constant growth markets performance was strong and revenue from these countries was up percent at constant currency our fourth consecutive quarter of constant currency performance in fact we had continued momentum in all of our growth initiatives growth markets business analytics cloud and smarter financial to profit we increased operating income by percent and operating net income percent bottom line we delivered operating eps of which was up percent year to strong earnings performance resulted in billion of free cash flow in the quarter and in the last months we generated billion of free cash flow with this strong cash performance we delivered significant returns to shareholders with almost billion in share repurchase and dividends this quarter and almost billion over the last i get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by by geographic performance was very consistent with the first quarter with growth markets and north america once again providing the biggest lift i discuss the geographic results on a local currency markets revenue was up percent the us our largest market was up percent and canada was up percent driven by momentum in our server and software businesses in europe we had a modest improvement in the growth rate with continued growth in the uk france and spain and this quarter germany and italy returned to growth rounding out the in japan our revenue was down percent consistent with the first quarter growth growth markets continued their very strong performance outpacing the majors by points since we announced our growth markets unit in the beginning of the revenue growth rate has outpaced the major markets by an average of points again on a local currency basis with percent revenue growth this is the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth and share gains we also had growth and share gains in each of the bric countries the combined revenue in the brics was up percent but our success goes beyond the brics we had growth in almost growth market growth is from a segment perspective as well this quarter we had percent growth in hardware with great performance in all systems brands these are higher value offerings not low end content for example we have new mainframe customers in growth markets countries just since the introduction of the z enterprise last year think of it as planting the flag which provides a great base for future software business supports the growth markets with websphere providing key underlying infrastructure capabilities this quarter websphere grew almost percent in the growth our services revenue was up percent with terrific performance in both gts and gbs our globally integrated business model allows us to rapidly deploy expertise and capabilities and with our decades of we can provide a it platform that can scale in fast growing environments this is showing up in our backlog the services backlog in growth markets is up about percent at actual rates over the last driving this performance we continuing to expand into new markets and build out it infrastructure in support of economic growth for example our base of business in regions like africa where we recently announced the extension of a relationship with bharti airtel to provide it solutions to its employees across african countries a strategic agreement with commercial bank of ethiopia to modernize core banking systems and a collaboration agreement with the university of ghana to foster new entrepreneurial approaches to education and r d and to support the adoption of new technologies such as cloud computing and business a lot of opportunity for us to capture and we remain confident that growth markets will approach percent of ibm geographic revenue in and drive half of ibm revenue growth with strong margin and gross profit margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment the total services revenue growth rate was percent or percent at constant currency in services we had great performance in the growth markets with constant currency revenue growth and improved gross margin which was points higher than the services margin in the major and technology had another great quarter with percent revenue growth system z mainframes were up about percent system x up percent and power systems were up percent as we continue to displace competitive systems our software business also grew percent once again growth was led by our business analytics portfolio storage management and business to gross profit our operating gross profit margin improved points the largest contribution came from systems and technology which was up points driven by improvements in every systems brand and an improving also expanded gross margin in software and global business let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was up percent with about half of the growth attributed to currency from both translation and hedging over the last months contributed points of the increase because this is a view of our operating expense it excludes the impact of amortization our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were up about million year to year predominantly in driver of expense growth is the impact of our hedgingprograms we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning with the change in currencies hedging programs generated losses this quarter as compared to gains last year of the roughly million year to year impact in cost and expense from our hedging programs approximately million is in expense including in other income and expense keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigate the translation benefits elsewhere in the p now let me get into the two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent as reported and up percent at constant currency global technology services grew percent or percent at constant currency and global business services grew percent or percent at constant currency total outsourcing revenue was billion up percent as reported or percent at constant currency this was driven by revenue from backlog which was up percent and growth from sales into our existing base accounts our total transactional revenue of billion was up percent or percent at constant currency we had outstanding performance this quarter in the growth markets with constant currency revenue up double digits in both the outsourcing and transactional businesses driving significant share gains for total services in the growth backlog was billion up billion year to year with billion from currency and billion from let move on to the two technology services revenue was billion gts outsourcing revenue was up percent or percent at constant currency growth was led by our performance in the growth markets with revenue up percent year to year at constant currency we gained share this quarter in total gts outsourcing in both the growth markets and the major markets integrated technology services revenue grew percent as reported and percent at constant currency here too the growth markets were the key driver with revenue up percent at constant currency and revenue for services within its was up over technology services income was up percent year to year a significant portion of the workforce rebalancing charges this quarter were for services normalized for the workforce rebalancing charges gts income was up percent more in line with to global business services revenue was billion application outsourcing revenue was up percent as reported and percent at constant currency consulting and systems integration which includes consulting ams systems integration and the us federal business grew percent as reported and was flat at constant currency we continued to have strong performance in our growth initiatives in gbs in the first half business analytics revenue was up over a geographic perspective gbs revenue was up percent at constant currency in the growth markets with balanced performance in both outsourcing and c si while major markets revenue was down percent year to year due to declines in a sector perspective growth was led by distribution communications and general business public sector revenue was down again this quarter driven by declines in government spending so although public sector performance had minimal impact on ibm it did impact the overall gbs growth rate in fact excluding public sector the remainder of gbs grew in the digit range at constant currency global business services was up percent year to year with tenths of a point of margin me close the services discussion with a final comment on the growth markets we making a lot of progress in these markets as we work with businesses to build out the infrastructure required to support future growth as i mentioned earlier the backlog in the growth markets was up almost percent in the past two years that backlog is now approaching percent of total services backlog and was a big contributor to services growth and the share gains we are seeing in these markets we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us in the growth markets which is a key driver of services performance in the had a terrific quarter with revenue of which is up percent year to year or percent at constant currency key branded middleware grew percent gaining share for the fifteenth straight quarter and extending our leadership in the middleware market key branded middleware accounted for percent of total software revenue as we continue to mix into the higher growth areas of the business segment income was up percent year to let me take you through the drivers by had another powerful quarter growing percent year to year and gaining share our growth is driven by our base business as well as acquisitions for example business process management grew percent driven by the synergies of our combined lombardi ilog and websphere products smarter commerce software which extends our capabilities in integration commerce solutions and enterprise marketing management had an excellent quarter driven by the combination of sterling commerce unica and coremetrics acquisitions with our websphere commerce base management grew percent year to year and gained share our distributed database had another terrific quarter with strong growth netezza again performed well transactional volumes were up percent year to year ibm netezza has more than a advantage over exadata for running analytics workloads since its introduction in when going against competition in proof of concepts the netezza appliance has an percent win rate this quarter we expanded the number of proof of concepts by percent year to year information management provides the foundation of ibm business analytics and optimization capabilities in the first half the software component of business analytics grew over percent in support of ibm overall business analytics growth of more than software grew percent year to year and we held share within tivoli storage grew nearly was up percent and gained share this was driven by strong performance from ibm social business offerings idc recently ranked ibm number one in worldwide market share for social platform summary software had another very powerful quarter with up percent and branded middleware up percent profit margins up tenths of a point income up and technology and was billion up percent year to year or percent at constant currency this performance was driven by growth in system z power system x and storage and continued growth in retail store solutions and microelectronics growth markets grew percent at constant currency with growth in all brands while major markets grew percent at constant currency globally systems technology gained points of market share in total servers driven by strong increases in system z and profit margin expanded points year to year to percent driven by margin expansion across the server and storage portfolio and margin increased let me take you through the z revenue grew percent year to year were up percent over the past quarters revenue is up percent year to year and mips up percent this has been the best quarter period in the past years since the started shipping in the third quarter of we have added new system z customers with more than in the growth markets last week we announced the zenterprise mid range server which costs percent less and delivers up to percent more performance than the previous business class system it utilizes up to processors running at ghz and can consolidate workloads from up to competitive servers on a single systems grew percent driven by strong growth in both entry and systems we again extended our market leadership this quarter the thirteenth consecutive quarter of share gain ibm strong performance accounted for all of the unix industry percent growth we continued our success in competitive take outs this quarter we had over competitive displacements which resulted in over million of business roughly percent of this came from oracle and percent from hp since the beginning of ibm drove nearly competitive displacements for about billion of hardware revenue grew percent driven by disk which was up grew percent year to year with growth of percent system x revenue in the growth markets was up percent at constant store solutions grew percent and held share and revenue was up percent year to systems technology had a great second quarter with revenue up percent with strength across the portfolio gross profit margins up points income more than doubled and margin up flow to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up million year to year the year to year improvement was in line with our net income the first half our free cash flow of billion was down year to year the decline is driven entirely by an increase due to income tax settlement payments that i discussed in the first quarter excluding this impact free cash flow would have been up a half billion dollars year to year our inventory continues to be well managed and collections remain at the uses of our cash in the first half we returned almost billion to shareholders we spent billion in share repurchase where we bought back almost million shares at the end of the second quarter we had billion remaining in our buyback authorization we took our dividend up percent in april and through june we paid out billion in dividends this is the sixteenth consecutive year that we raised our dividend and the eighth year in a row of at the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash balance of billion up million from the end of last debt was billion billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at seven to one our debt was billion and our was percent consistent with year end and with a year ago with this amount of leverage we continue to have a high degree of financial balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long eps bridge to now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share revenue growth of percent contributed cents to our earnings growth the cent deterioration from margin reflects a cent year to year impact from higher workforce rebalancing charges and a lower share count contributed cents fairly consistent with last this quarter revenue led our earnings per share revenue growth of percent or percent at constant currency this is the fourth consecutive quarter of digit revenue quarter we had great growth in our transaction businesses and continued success in our four key growth initiatives our growth markets strategy to expand into new markets build out it infrastructure and focus on leadership in specific industries is resulting in solid growth and share gains our growth markets countries grew percent at constant currency in the second quarter and the first half and contributed about half of ibm geographic revenue business analytics we helping our customers optimize the massive amounts of data they dealing with through the first half our business analytics revenue was up over percent with good contribution from both software and cloud we had over wins year to date in private cloud our average transaction size has tripled from a year ago in the first half of cloud revenue has already exceeded our full year results keeping us on track to double our cloud revenue for the smarter planet revenue growth in the first half was over percent this quarter growth was driven by solutions in our telecom healthcare and retail industries we also gaining traction in our smarter commerce initiative launched in the first quarter and ramping our key smarter planet services we have good momentum in our growth plays and are continuing to invest in solutions and capabilities to drive future growth in the first half of we delivered revenue growth of percent or percent at constant currency operating net income growth of percent operating eps growth of percent and returned billion to through the year are increasing our full year expectation for operating earnings per share to at least on our way to operating eps of at least in patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of items first we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks second i ask you to refrain from we conclude the q a i turn the call back to mark for final please open it up for of prepared comments loughridge made during the question and answer period in connection with this presentation included the following commentary on the benefit to profit from currency as well as the closing comments below i want to start with the operational aspects of movements in currency so when you see movements in currency especially when you see sustained movements over longer periods of time the competition adjusts the marketplace adjusts we use some of that advantage especially in consecutive quarters of a weakening dollar to improve our position competitively at the table and essentially pass some of that currency advantage to our customers and i want to keep that operational aspect of competing in a global business in mind as we go through this we do the calculation of currency that a straight mathematical analysis translational impact netted for the hedge when we do that analysis that really defines the theoretical maximum that currency would be i do think it that much i know in my business work when i was pricing pcs we were adjusting special bids for changes in currency every single day and we were doing that because competition was doing the same at the table and rolling some of that advantage into their price point to win the business so if you take that simple mathematical calculation and remember that that a theoretical maximum netted for the hedge that about within the quarter we also had a unique event with the amount of restructuring that we had again million if you net those two the difference of the theoretical maximum on currency netted for restructuring that about million so now with that million in mind let return to the operational example i gave of how much is really a pass through to your customer sets to win the deal at the competitive table is it percent well how much benefit did we get on the revenue line it was about billion did we pass percent of that through did we pass would you pass half through i mean we see it not only in transactional businesses but we see it in annuity business over sustained periods of time as frankly just to book end the argument all you need is about five to percent of that billion theoretical maximum revenue benefit from currency to be passed through to your customer set and that adjustment alone would mitigate all of that net benefit of currency relative to restructuring if it was more than that five to percent in fact the net effect would have been a hurt to the p l within the period so i think it a long answer but it really is the way currency rolls out and there are real operational aspects of that that we need to consider as we analyze the effect so let me take this opportunity now to just make a few comments as we wrap up the call so this quarter we continued our strong performance revenue growth at percent was driven by our transaction businesses with hardware and software both up percent we had fantastic performance across our growth initiatives smarter

up over points driven by improvements in power system z and system let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was up percent with over half of the growth attributed to currency from both translation and hedging dynamics acquisitions over the last months contributed points of the increase because this is a view of our operating expense it excludes the impact of amortization our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up comment on a couple of expense items that had larger impacts to our we had a million decrease in investment gains which increased our expense year to year this is driven by a gain in the third quarter of last year associated with the disposition of a joint driver of our expense growth is the impact of our hedging programs we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning with the change in currencies hedging programs generated losses in the quarter which mitigate the translation benefits elsewhere in the p l of the roughly million impact in cost and expense from these programs million is in expense almost entirely in other income and now let me

the full year we delivered revenue of almost billion which was up percent operating income of billion up percent and operating eps of up percent our results put us well on track to our roadmap at the fourth quarter by segment we continued to build our momentum in software our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution our software revenue was up percent driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like smarter commerce business analytics and storage solutions our software profit was up services businesses delivered powerful margin and profit growth with combined income up percent services revenue growth was again led by growth markets which were up percent at constant currency our total services backlog ended the year at billion at constant currency that flat year to year and up billion since hardware power systems was up percent as we continued to drive competitive displacements we now had consecutive quarters of share gain in fact with the exception of mainframe which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year each of our brands across the company gained or held financial to profit our ongoing focus on productivity together with the relative strength of our software business drove strong margin performance our operating gross margin was up points to over percent we expanded operating margin almost a full point and grew income percent and while our tax rate was up year to year we still expanded net margin above our model you put this all together we delivered operating eps of which is up percent and for the year up percent making this our ninth consecutive year of eps strong earnings performance drove billion of free cash flow in the quarter and billion for the year with that cash we continued to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over billion in share repurchase and dividends this forward we confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin grow profit generate cash and return value to shareholders and in we expect to deliver at least of operating earnings per share for the by the fourth quarter revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations while currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about basis points in the quarter currency movements since we announced our third quarter earnings in october impacted our revenue by about a point of growth or at the geographies on a constantcurrency basis revenue in our major markets countries was essentially flat year to the americas canada had terrific performance up percent the grew percent off of last year very strong growth of europe our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter germany returned to growth up percent and once again we had good growth in the uk and spain which were each up percent we now had consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the uk and spain has now grown consecutive quarters leveraging its global growth markets outpaced the major markets by points of revenue growth the brics had another good quarter combined they were up percent and with nearly of our growth markets business outside the brics all together we had growth in growth market countries so our performance was we continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out it infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries this year to drive market expansion we opened new branches and we added over new sales we gained points of share this quarter and points for the our growth markets grew percent which outpaced the majors by markets now make up percent of our geographic and gross profit margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment global technology services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter while our global business services growth rate improved in both segments we had great performance in the growth markets with constant currency revenue growth and expanding software business had another fantastic quarter with strength across our portfolio websphere information management and tivoli all had very good growth and gained systems and technology last year we had a great fourth quarter with over percent growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost percent revenue growth this quarter we wrapped on that performance we had strength in power as we continued to extend our share to gross profit our operating gross margin improved points to over percent driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software the services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets for hardware our product mix negatively impacted our global financing business which is better measured by return on equity this quarter delivered roe of percent now that now let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was up percent in line with our revenue growth acquisitions over the last months contributed a point of growth and our base expense was up percent there was effectively no impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging comment on a couple of expense items that had larger impacts to our profit as you can see from our income statement ip income was down million year to year second we had an increase of about million in our accounts receivable provisions though our reserve coverage is down basis points from a year ago and down basis points since we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense however this quarter there was effectively no impact on expense due to our hedging programs consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a now let me get into the two services segments delivered billion in revenue up percent the combined services segments grew profit percent and margin was up points total outsourcing revenue was billion up percent and total transactional revenue was billion up percent overall growth was driven by the growth markets with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing transactional and maintenance businesses total backlog in the quarter was billion at constant currency that is flat year to year and up billion quarter to on to the two segments in global technology services revenue was billion up percent gts outsourcing revenue was up percent and we gained share in the quarter and full year integrated technology services revenue grew percent we had great performance in the growth markets where we are seeing the benefits of geographic expansion in offerings like business continuity and resiliency technology services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter with income up percent and margin up points to percent this margin expansion was driven by productivity and cost management along with a mix into the higher margin growth markets we had gross margin improvement in all lines of business outsourcing its and to global business services revenue was billion up percent application outsourcing revenue was up percent led by strong performance in the growth markets consulting and systems integration which includes consulting ams systems integration and the us federal business grew percent at constant currency our growth rate improved over last quarter overall gbs revenue continued to be impacted by japan and public sector so total gbs revenue excluding japan and public sector was up percent at constant currency and up percent for the year and although declines in japan and public sector continued we did see some improved performance in public business services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter profit was up percent year to year with margin up points to i want to spend a minute on backlog and run out as we begin services backlog run year in the fourth quarter we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of services revenue we focused the discussion around outsourcing and in particular the revenue generated by the of the outsourcing backlog this year we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the total services backlog run out this view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the total services business as we start the are three primary drivers of total services revenue backlog sales into our existing contract base and new client signings a very high percentage of services revenue roughly percent comes from the run out of the backlog we start the year with in we expect about percent revenue growth from that backlog this gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts which have been on a good trajectory and new client with that let me wrap up the year in services we had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog we continue to build out our services within the growth markets with total services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins with gross margin points higher than in the majors we continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives cloud business analytics and smarter planet and we had great profit and margin performance in both services segments with gts profit up percent and gbs up percent as we mix to higher value offerings and markets and continue to drive had another great quarter with revenue of billion up percent key branded middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the seventeenth straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware to brand performance websphere was up percent and continues to gain share each of websphere five product areas grew percent or better including our smarter commerce offerings which were up over percent this contributed to ibm performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last management grew percent and again gained share our distributed database grew double digits led by strong performances from our netezza offerings which were up nearly percent this appliance complements and extends our business analytics portfolio with a solution for high performance queries and analytics for the quarter almost a third of the transactions were with new netezza clients since acquiring netezza ibm has expanded its customer base by over percent and when we go against competition in proof of concepts we had a win rate of over percent this quarter our business analytics software offerings most of which are part of information management continue to outpace the market with growth ibm acquisition of algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business software was up percent and gained share driven by storage software growth of percent security solutions also delivered strong growth with the recent acquisition of labs we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict prevent and detect all types of security grew percent and gained share driven by strong performance in fourth quarter another powerful year for our software business in software revenue grew percent gross margin expanded by one half of a point and software delivered nearly billion of technology and technology revenue of billion was down percent this performance reflects very strong growth last year driven by mainframe growth of almost percent gross profit margin was down points year to year with a significant impact from product let me take you through the z revenue declined percent as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zenterprise last year mips declined percent this quarter system z gross profit margin was up reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades which is typical at this point in the product grew percent this is the fifteenth consecutive quarter of share gains in power we continued our success in competitive takeouts in the fourth quarter we had over competitive displacements which resulted in over million of business this is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in roughly percent of this business came from hp with most of the balance from was the second year in a row we had over competitive displacements which this year generated over billion of x revenue declined percent we anticipate this is in line with the hardware revenue was down percent when combined with the storage software growth of percent the total grew store solutions had a great quarter up percent and we continued to grow you look at the full year systems and technology delivered solid performance with revenue up percent gross margin up points and billion in income up percent year to flow to cash flow on a full year basis we generated billion of free cash flow which is up million over last year excluding the impact of income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity which i discussed in prior quarters full year free cash flow would have been up billion roughly in line with our net income growth we continue to invest in our business spending another billion in capital i look at the uses of cash for the year we returned billion to shareholders including billion in dividends and we bought back almost million shares for billion at the end of the year we had billion remaining in our buyback addition we spent almost billion to acquire five companies over the last two years we spent almost billion in addition we announced several acquisitions that did close by year end including emptoris demandtec platform computing and earlier this month green billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and billion for the year we positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to at the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a cash balance of billion up million from debt was billion of which billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at just over our debt was billion up million from the third quarter and up billion from a year let me spend a minute on our plans and the impact to the balance sheet despite volatile market conditions in we had good returns on global assets the discount rate environment was challenging which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year this took our up to percent and we are comfortable operating in this range of percent to percent at the end of our defined benefit qualified plans were well funded and our cash requirements remain stable we have supplemental charts that show the specific performance and rates as well as a forward looking view of the p l and cash implications based on year end assumptions with sensitivities suffice it to say that as we look forward while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in elements of the p l there is little implication to our cash eps bridge to now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share that we faced a tough fourth quarter compare on revenue we drove other elements of our model productivity mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance our revenue growth contributed cents to our earnings growth our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate gross margin drove cents of eps growth while we had a cent impact from expense and a cent impact from a higher tax rate all in margin expansion contributed cents and a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed line we delivered percent eps growth in the eps bridge to for the full year we delivered percent growth revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin year was another very good year for us with solid revenue performance continued margin expansion strong profit and cash generation and effective use of focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud our growth markets strategy to expand into new markets build out it infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains these countries contributed almost of ibm constant currency revenue growth and now represent percent of ibm geographic revenue our business analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results this year business analytics grew percent our smarter planet initiatives generated close to percent growth smarter commerce in particular is gaining momentum by helping companies buy market sell and service their products and services we not just addressing an existing market we actually making markets and in cloud we helping our clients improve the economics of it this year we continued to expand our offerings and our cloud revenue in was more than three times the prior year with powerful contribution from these growth initiatives we delivered percent revenue said at the beginning of the year that we expected growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half by leveraging all of the elements of our model productivity mix and utilization of cash we delivered operating and net income growth of percent and operating eps growth of percent with growth in each of the four now as we enter we expect to deliver operating eps of at least for the year with the growth rate more skewed to the second transformation we just completed our centennial year and as we reached this milestone we learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago we been shifting our business to higher value areas improving productivity and investing to drive future changes contributed to nine consecutive years of earnings per share growth but more importantly they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our roadmap objective of at least of operating patricia and i will take your you mark before we begin the q a i like to remind you of a couple of items first we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks second i ask you to refrain from we conclude the q a i turn the call back to mark for final please open it up for of prepared comments loughridge made during the question and answer period in connection with this presentation included the following commentary as well as the closing comments below let me now start from the ibm level and then i go to the eps skew and the drivers in the you look at the software base of business i think we got real momentum going into you saw that in our fourth quarter achievement additionally within that i can tell you that our acquisition performance for the billion of acquisition spend that we did in plus the of acquisition spend that we did in the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best i seen in years real traction we enter with traction on our software business and i believe software ought to be able to generate profitability once explained that for our services business that comes from backlog now against a total backlog for services we already have about revenue growth from the backlog which would comprise about of our revenue the balance of the revenue comes from new signings and base growth but even if new signings and base growth were flat which i do believe it will be then of the would drive points of revenue growth in services we showed last year that we could drive profitability and we will run the same plays to deliver again so we driving for profit growth in our services question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half eps growth that really the stg equation so stg will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year announcement cycle on the high end but when we get to the new announcements and get into the second half i would expect that stg should return to mid single digit revenue growth and with that profit that all together gives us a good if you compared that first half to second half eps growth rate i talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half it not like a major difference but i do think it has a couple of points

revenue expanded gross and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of which is up percent year to year and now days into the year we are increasing our full year expectation for operating eps to at least this is up cents from our previous view of at least at the results by segment we continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics cloud and smarter planet our software profit was up services we expanded margins and increased total services profit by percent as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings and markets services revenue growth was again led by growth markets which were up percent at constant currency and our backlog in growth markets was up percent at constant expected our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of percent in the first quarter of last year this quarter we extended our leadership in the unix market as we continued our competitive displacements in power and just last week we announced puresystems the first new class of computing in over years this ibm investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise this should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the financial to profit our ongoing focus on productivity together with the relative strength of our software business drove strong margin performance we expanded operating gross margin by over a point led by services and our operating net margin was up a similar amount net income this quarter we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating income and our tax rate you recall that in the first quarter of last year our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by investment gains this quarter our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year but this year the charge was offset by a tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in latin america excluding this benefit we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of percent so a very similar dynamic to last year with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges though this year the offset is included below the pti line in through margin expansion together with effective use of cash we delivered operating eps of which was up percent year to to cash flow we generated almost billion of free cash flow in the quarter really strong performance in addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on areas where we can add the most value this quarter we closed five acquisitions for a total of billion the acquisitions increase our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our smarter planet i get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography where as always i discuss the results on a local currency by the first quarter revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations revenue in our major markets countries was essentially flat year to the americas performance was led by canada which was up percent the us was flat off of last year strong growth of again grew at percent in line with the fourth quarter so we seeing some stability there the most consistent performance has come from the uk and spain with percent growth the uk has delivered consecutive quarters of growth and spain continues to leverage its global relationships now growing in each of the last quarters germany posted modest growth while france growth markets outpaced the major markets by points of revenue growth even with a tough compare the brics had another good quarter combined they were up percent and with about percent of our growth markets business outside the brics all together we had growth in growth market countries this is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets and we accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that and gross profit margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment global technology services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters and global business services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in japan and public software business had another great quarter driven by our offerings in business analytics smarter commerce and storage systems and technology last year we had a very strong first quarter driven by product cycles in mainframe and power so our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare though we continued to take share in to gross profit our operating gross margin improved points driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was up percent acquisitions over the last months contributed points of the increase currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by points and our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was up comment on a couple of expense items that had larger impacts to our profit first in last year results we had investment gains of over million primarily for the sale of lenovo shares this gain effectively funded the million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year first quarter this year we had a tax benefit from a tax restructuring in latin america and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges which again were about million so the net effect to net income was negligible both within the period and year to expense item i comment on is a help from our hedging programs we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning last year hedging programs generated losses in the quarter this year our hedging was down million year to year as you would expect given the change in currencies of this about million year to year is in expense most of which is in other income and expense now keep in mind that you ca look at the hedges in isolation they mitigate the translation impacts across the p now let me go into the two services segments delivered billion in revenue grew profit by percent and expanded margin by points backlog was billion down percent at actual rates and up percent at constant started with continued momentum in our growth initiatives margin expansion and strong profit growth revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter driven by strong backlog growth total growth markets backlog was up percent year to year at constant currency reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets we also had strong performance in business analytics cloud and smarter planet on to the two segments inglobal technology services revenue was billion up percent or percent at constant currency gts outsourcing revenue was up percent or percent at constant currency and we gained share again this quarter integrated technology services revenue grew percent we had great performance in the growth markets up percent year to year at constant technology services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter with income up percent and margin up points there were three primary drivers of this margin expansion first we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within gts and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives second we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets and finally gts has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts within that portfolio there a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics we have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts and we are seeing the yield from these efforts in our to global business services revenue was billion down percent or percent at constant currency we had modest declines in both application outsourcing and consulting and systems integration i previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and smarter planet where gbs is leading many of the engagements across ibm within gbs business analytics grew percent and smarter planet grew percent these are very important initiatives for a geographic perspective the growth markets continued to perform well with growth again this quarter while the major markets continued to be weighed down by japan and by public sector which declined more sharply this quarter japan and public sector which represent over of total global business services revenue impacted the overall gbs constant currency growth rate by points gbs income was also impacted by japan this quarter two large contracts in japan impacted our profit by almost million so japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in gbs this quarter but as you know we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts this quarter our total services business delivered profit growth and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the had another strong quarter with revenue of billion up percent or percent at constant currency key branded middleware gained share for the straight quarter as revenue mixes to the faster growing branded middleware this quarter branded middleware accounted for percent of our total software up a point from the same period last year once again named ibm the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for ibm segment income was billion up percent from last let me take you through the drivers by brand websphere had another excellent quarter growing percent and gaining share for the fourteenth consecutive quarter websphere we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in smarter commerce the first quarter we strengthened our smarter commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of demandtec a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of emptoris which helps clients reduce procurement costs and percent growth information management continues to perform well and gain share analytics had a very strong quarter with growth in cognos our acceleration in cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management we continued to expand our global netezza footprint with about of our new clients outside of north america for the quarter netezza had a of nearly percent in proof of concept software was up percent and we held share within tivoli our storage portfolio was up once again security including contributed to our tivoli growth as clients turn to ibm for intelligence integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of grew percent and we gained share performance was driven by another quarter of growth in software had another terrific quarter with revenue up percent at constant currency income up percent and margins up points with this performance software was a strong contributor to our growth technology and technology revenue of billion was down percent following the very strong growth a year z revenue declined percent versus last year first quarter growth of over percent mips declined percent this quarter and we mixed toward specialty engines system z gross profit margin was up again which is typical at this point in the product was flat and up percent at constant currency we had particular strength this quarter in power high performance computing solutions in power we had over competitive displacements which resulted in over million of business roughly percent of this business came from hp with most of the balance from this is the sixteenth consecutive quarter of share gains in x revenue was flat and we held share system x revenue in the growth markets was up percent at constant currency this is the tenth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in these emerging hardware revenue was down percent the value continues to shift to software and this quarter storage software was up week we established a new category of computing with the introduction of puresystems a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of ibm innovation with software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new it infrastructure these revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new it capabilities quickly and efficiently currently companies spend percent or more of it budgets on simple operations and maintenance puresystems has the potential to lower total it cost by more than percent over years allowing the business to reinvest these savings toward new projects and innovation these new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers this will start to contribute to our performance in the second you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to toshiba tec and the creation of a partnership to address the smarter commerce opportunity the financial implications will be outlined on our investor website including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity primarily outside the united states but what really important is the relationship going forward we partnering with the world leader in systems at the same time we continue to build out our smarter commerce capabilities in our sweet spot managing transactions and data and applying analytics combined we have the best platform in the market for flow on to cash flow in the quarter we generated billion of free cash flow up billion year to year in the first quarter of last year our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact we had growth in free cash flow the growth was driven by net income and working capital at the uses of our cash we spent billion to acquire five companies platform computing green hat emptoris worklight and demandtec these acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and smarter returned billion to shareholders including almost million in dividends and we bought back million shares for billion at the end of the first quarter we had billion remaining in our buyback to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a cash balance of billion up million from year debt was billion of which billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at to one our debt was billion up from billion at year end at these debt levels was percent up point from year continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long eps bridge to now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this ongoing focus on productivity together with the relative strength of our software business drove strong margin performance with gross and net margins all up year to year and a lower share count contributed cents fairly consistent with last fact when you look at this quarter it really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase even at the segment and geography level revenue growth was similar to the again our growth initiatives led the performance our growth markets initiative is based on expanding into new markets building out it infrastructures and leading in targeted industries we consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains this quarter growth markets revenue was up percent with countries delivering growth at constant currency in business analytics we have a broad portfolio of

in smarter commerce you look at our offerings in business analytics cloud and smarter planet about half of the revenue is software so the success we having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and our the same time we continuing to invest in r d capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas this investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets but actually create new markets and new categories of computing last week announcement of puresystems was a great example of how we leveraging our organic research and development to create a solution for our

operating margins delivered operating earnings per share of up percent year to year and generated free cash flow of billion up percent so when you look at it our results demonstrate the strength of ibm business model which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable with this performance we are increasing our full year expectation for operating eps to at least this is up cents from our previous view of at least comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment in software we had mid constant currency growth in europe and japan growth in the growth markets while the us growth was lower due to very strong performance a year growth at constant currency was consistent with last quarter with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue and profit our backlog was flat year to year at constant currency and we again expanded margins and grew our combined services segment profit by hardware business declined as you would expect at this point in our product cycles though we continued to extend our share leadership in our two high end server financial total ibm revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter we entered the quarter with a currency headwind but it got even tougher over the last days when you look at the reported revenue currency impacted our revenue growth by almost points or billion of revenue but in spite of this headwind we generated strong operating profit performance with and net income each up an important element of our long term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses this quarter we expanded operating gross margin by a point and a half with due to improvement in segment margins and the other third from mix we improved operating pti margin by more than points and operating net margin by points so this quarter again we demonstrated the flexibility in our model bottom line we delivered operating eps of which was up percent year to to cash we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter that up percent slightly faster than net income when you consider the last months we generated a record billion of free cash flow with this strong cash performance we delivered significant returns to shareholders with billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and nearly billion over the last i get into the second quarter details starting with revenue by geography where i discuss the results on a constant currency by the americas canada was up while the us again was flat year to was also flat year to year slowing just a point from last quarter growth rate but in total still relatively stable as in the past there is a good bit of variability by country we had growth again in the uk and spain germany was flat while france and italy declined overall revenue in our major market countries was down percent year to percent growth our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by points even with a tough compare the brics had another good quarter combined they were up percent we had particular strength in russia and china in fact china was up over percent this quarter again gaining share we continuing to build our capabilities here we expanded the number of branch offices and now have and over virtual branch offices open across all of china across the growth markets this quarter more than countries grew at a growth rate so our strength is broad based we capturing the opportunity from these faster growing economies and importantly we taking share due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiative in fact this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth and gross profit margin by now let me add a little color to our revenue and gross margin by total services both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up percent at constant currency and we continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth markets software this quarter we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management systems and technology revenue decline was roughly in line with our first quarter rate this quarter we again took share in power driven by competitive to gross profit our operating gross margin improved one and a half points driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was down percent this was driven by currency from both translation and hedging dynamics acquisitions over the last months drove points of expense growth and our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was down comment on a couple of expense items first though it was a significant driver year to year we had about million of workforcerebalancing in the quarter primarily in europe second we had the benefit from our hedgingprograms which as you know can not be looked at in isolation as it mitigates the translation impacts across the p l we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash year hedging programs generated fairly significant losses an impact to expense of million while this year the programs generated gains of about million in expense this represents over of our hedging activity the balance is in cost this is the dynamic you would expect given the change in currencies but again this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the p now let me go into the two services segments delivered billion in revenue grew profit by percent and expanded margin by points backlog was billion down percent year to year at actual rates and flat at constant services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter the growth markets were up percent at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down percent at constant currency within the major markets looking at revenue north america was stable japan was still down though we did see some improvement over last quarter and europe decelerated compared to last quarter and we continued the strong performance in our business analytics cloud and smarter planet profit performance was very strong with percent growth in global technology services profit and percent growth in global business services on to the two segments inglobal technology services revenue was billion down percent as reported and up percent at constant currency gts outsourcing revenue was up percent at constant currency integrated technology services revenue was up percent at constant currency with the growth markets up nearly percent at constant technology services delivered very strong profit and margin with income up percent and margin up points last quarter i commented on the tremendous amount of work that gts has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts specifically by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts this work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin and accounted for about of the gross margin expansion in gts this quarter although there will be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward we should see ongoing benefits to the to global business services revenue was billion down percent as reported and down percent at constant currency consulting and systems integration revenues were flat year to year at constant currency and application outsourcing revenues declined percent at constant currency looking at revenue from a geographic perspective the growth markets continued to perform well with their fifth consecutive quarter of percent growth or better north america was relatively stable while japan was down this quarter revenue in europe decreased percent at constant currency after being flat last looking at the growth initiatives within gbs we have been remixing and shifting more resource to these higher value growth initiatives this quarter gbs revenue included strong growth in business analytics which was up percent and smarter planet up percent but gbs value extends beyond what is reported in the gbs segment they play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across ibm where we are seeing continued strong finally gbs returned to a more typical level of profitability as we indicated on our last call so this quarter income grew percent and margin improved by revenue of billion was flat as reported and up percent at constant currency branded middleware which accounted for percent of total software revenue in the second quarter increased percent at constant currency in line with the market software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits and europe and japan both grew at mid single digits all in constant currency growth in the us was impacted by a very tough compare we see great opportunity in our global software business and are to sales representatives each month through year let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands websphere grew percent at constant currency and gained share for the consecutive quarter websphere we had good growth in our commerce and portals offerings this quarter we acquired tealeaf a provider of customer experience management software which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile management was up percent at constant currency and held share netezza continued to expand its global footprint with very strong growth in europe japan and growth markets and added nearly new clients worldwide this quarter we closed two more acquisitions expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities varicent an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management and vivisimo which enhances ibm big data initiative by helping clients analyze volume variety and velocity of

billion in free cash flow through the first half our free cash flow of billion was up billion year to year the growth was driven by net income as i mentioned previously in the first quarter of last

operating margins and increased operating earnings per share by percent to for the year we are maintaining our full year expectation for operating eps of at least that up percent over last at our third quarter revenue by geography europe was fairly consistent with last quarter japan revenue stabilized the bric countries in total performed well again but north america declined when i look at our skew of business in the quarter through the first two months our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance the third month of the quarter was more quarter we delivered operating earnings per share growth driven by strength in our solutions offerings a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity first we continued to drive very good results in our solution offerings across software and services that address key demand areas like smarter planet business analytics and cloud second our annuity businesses which represent about half of our annual revenue and percent of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit and third we continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver billion of productivity over the roadmap the benefit from these initiatives together with our mix to more profitable businesses helped to drive our margin financial before i get into the financial metrics i want to remind you that this quarter we closed the sale of our retail store solutions business to toshiba tec in most countries the transaction results in a loss of revenue and profit for the divested operations a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate as we go through the presentation i clarify the impact of each of the quarter ibm revenue was down percent including a currency headwind of nearly points at constant currency we were down percent or down percent if you normalize for the rss in spite of this revenue decline we had solid operating profit growth with income up percent and net income up percent our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives improving business mix and the overall currency quarter we expanded operating gross margin by points with about percent due to improvement in margins and the balance from mix with good expense management we improved operating pti margin by two and a half quarter our tax rate was up over a point year to year the increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our rss business we now expect an operating effective tax rate excluding one time items in the range of and a half percent for the line we delivered operating eps of which was up percent year to eps bridge to you look at the drivers of our operating eps performance percent decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by cents per expansion was the largest contributor to our growth within that the gain on the rss divestiture contributed cents gross margin expansion added cents and our expense productivity another cents on the other hand we did have an increase in our workforce rebalancing activity for an impact of ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with the first two quarters of the eps bridge to you can see the dynamics are very similar to our first half i get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography where i discuss the results on a constant currency by revenue was down percent with declines in both the us and north america software was up percent services was down and we had a decline in hardware with revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter emea was stable looking at the performance by country germany and spain grew the uk was flat while france and italy declined turning to asia pacific last quarter i said that i expected our business in japan to stabilize this quarter our revenue in japan was flat year to year so certainly an improvement over the last several quarters we had good performance in both europe and japan given the our growth markets countries which we refer to as gmu the brics had another good quarter combined they were up percent we had growth in russia which was up percent india up percent and china up percent brazil however was down percent looking beyond the brics australia and mexico were down double digits this quarter while most of the other countries continued to do well in fact this quarter of the growth markets countries grew at a rate reflecting ongoing and gross profit margin by at ibm revenue and gross margin by segment our total services revenue was flat as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter term and activity software performance was driven by growth across our solutions areas like business analytics commerce and social business our systems and technology revenue declined each month though performance in september improved as we introduced our next generation system to gross profit our operating gross margin improved points driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of let take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending total operating expense and other income was down percent the primary driver was currency which drove points from both translation and hedging dynamics acquisitions over the last months drove points of expense growth so consequently our base expense was better by i comment on a few expense items sg a includes a charge of over million for workforce rebalancing activity which at ibm average tax rate impacted net income by about income and expense had two drivers first a gain for the sale of our retail store solutions business and second we had a impact from our hedging activity the gain for the rss sale is almost million with a discrete tax rate on that gain based on the countries closed the transaction contributed about million of net to the hedging activity we hedge our major cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning last year hedging programs generated losses resulting in an impact to expense of about million while this year the programs generated gains of about million in expense roughly percent of our hedging activity this quarter was in expense the balance is in cost as you know this hedging activity ca be looked at in isolation as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the p income by at how all of this translates into margins by segment we provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments on this basis you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in global technology services global business services and let turn to the segments starting with two services segments delivered billion in revenue and excluding workforce rebalancing charges grew profit percent and expanded margin by just over points backlog was billion up percent year to year we continued to see strong performance in the growth markets with backlog up percent at constant currency and globally transactional backlog was up percent at constant to the two segments inglobal technology services revenue was billion down percent as reported and up percent at constant outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency as we previously discussed there are three primary sources of revenue in outsourcing first revenue from backlog which makes up the majority of revenue in the year second revenue from new client signings within the year and finally revenue from base growth which comes from new business sold into existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter this quarter we continued to get revenue growth from our backlog however we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first technology services revenue was up percent at constant currency with the growth markets up percent at constant technology services delivered flat profit growth in the quarter though excluding workforce rebalancing charges pre tax profit was up percent with points of margin expansion this quarter there are a number of drivers of margin expansion first increased contribution from the growth markets which continue to drive higher gross margin than our major markets second lift from our continued focus on automation and process primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives and finally we continue to benefit from the work gts has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within strategic to global business services revenue was billion down percent as reported or down percent at constant at revenue from a geographic perspective the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance japan returned to growth this quarter with revenue up percent at constant currency while north america and europe were both down percent at constant at the gbs business by offering the growth initiatives continue to drive strong growth we had solid growth in business analytics smarter planet and cloud together these initiatives represent about one third of total gbs revenue so we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives and we are seeing the benefits across ibm the overall growth rate of gbs is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional packaged application to profit gbs income declined

operating earnings per share of which is up percent year to year and generated billion of free cash flow for the full year we delivered revenue of billion and expanded gross and net margins our operating eps for the year was up percent to and we generated billion of free cash flow that up over a billion and a half year to let me put this full year eps and cash flow performance in perspective this is the tenth consecutive year of eps growth so a decade at a pace and the billion of free cash flow is billion higher than a decade ago that an increase in the cash flow we generate in a year not a cumulative at our fourth quarter by segment our performance was led by continued momentum in our growth initiatives and successful product launches in our systems both of which drive a more profitable mix we had another good quarter in software the performance was broad based driven by business analytics smarter commerce and cloud with strength in several of the emerging areas where we been targeting our investments like social business mobile and security our new hardware product introductions really performed in the quarter we had excellent acceptance of our new mainframe and our system z revenue was up percent year to year so it been a very successful launch not only in major markets but in growth markets where we were up over percent and we had significant growth in our mainframe specialty engines led by linux this is a good indicator not only of new workloads moving onto the platform but also of the value of a vertically integrated system the revenue performance in our total services businesses was fairly consistent with last quarter once again we had strength in all of our growth initiatives which are becoming a larger part of the financial ibm revenue was down percent at actual rates it was up percent at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of our retail store solutions business that a two point improvement from last quarter constant currency growth rate consistent with our business model to move to higher value areas we had revenue growth in our higher margin businesses the improving business mix and our productivity initiatives drove percent growth in operating and net looking at the margin dynamics we expanded operating gross margin by over two points with improvements across our major segments and a continued mix to software with our ongoing focus on expense productivity we improved operating pti margin by points this quarter our operating tax rate was flat year to year and we continue to expect an operating effective tax rate in the range of percent for our net income margin was up almost two points and with billion in gross share repurchase over the last months we reduced our share count by you pull this all together we delivered operating eps of which is up percent for the year operating eps is up percent to our strong earnings performance drove billion of free cash flow terrific performance for a quarter and for the year over billion of free cash flow a record for forward we confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand our margins grow profit generate cash and deliver shareholder value and in we expect to deliver at least of operating earnings per share for the year keeping us on track to our objective of at least in by at the geographies on a constant currency basis americas revenue was up percent led by terrific growth in latin america the us revenue was down percent a point improvement in the growth rate compared to the third quarter canada was down percent off of last year very strong growth of percent emea revenue decline of percent reflects the macroeconomic climate in the region it was more challenging this quarter in the uk and germany though we did see an improvement in italy asia pacific growth improved to percent led by japan early in we said that we expected our performance in japan to stabilize in the second half of the year and in fact we returned to growth this quarter so we had great performance from the team in all of the geographies our growth markets delivered points of growth outpacing the major markets by points the bric countries delivered percent growth the strongest quarter of the year brazil contributed to almost percent growth in latin america we also had good performance in africa led by south africa and in the middle east in fact across all of our growth markets we had growth in over growth market countries reflecting ongoing and gross profit margin by to revenue and gross margin by segment revenue performance in our combined services businesses was fairly consistent with the third quarter at constant currency global business services performance improved modestly while global technology services revenue growth slowed a bit we had good results across our software business with growth in all of our key brands and particular strength and share gains in websphere lotus and rational in systems and technology we returned to growth adjusting for the divested rss business this was driven by powerful performance in system to gross profit our operating gross margin improved points to percent driven by a combination of the strong mainframe growth good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software finally our global financing business delivered over percent return on now let take a look at our expense total operating expense and other income was down percent acquisitions over the last months drove points of expense growth the benefit from currency translation and hedging moderated this quarter contributing about a point of expense decline consequently our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by to the expense items that have more significant profit impacts i comment on just one item our accounts receivable provision was about million in the quarter an improvement of almost million from last year when we increased provisions to reflect the european credit environment typically we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense however this quarter there was effectively no period or impact on expense due to our hedging now let me get into the the quarter the two services segments delivered billion in revenue grew profit percent and expanded margin by a point total backlog was billion up billion year to year at constant currency driven by growth in the transactional businesses from a geographic perspective the growth markets backlog was up percent at constant the year the combined services businesses grew profit percent and expanded margin by nearly points excluding workforce rebalancing charges in the third to the two segments inglobaltechnology services revenue was billion down percent as reported and flat at constant currency there were two major categories within the major markets that affected revenue growth first we did a tremendous amount of work to address a number of low margin contracts to improve the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio we see the benefits of that work in our profit and our margin performance though it does have some impact on revenue this quarter the impact was a point of revenue growth to gts and to services in total second we saw a decline in revenue from sales and volumes into existing base accounts this activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economically can see the impact of these in our gts outsourcing revenue which was down percent at constant currency in outsourcing we continued to have strong performance in growth markets with revenue up percent and backlog up percent both at constant currency this backlog growth reflects an ongoing trend as our clients are building out their infrastructures and scaling to meet the growth objectives of their integrated technology services revenue was up percent at constant currency with the growth markets up double digits at constant technology services delivered percent profit growth in the quarter and expanded margin by over a point this quarter margin expansion resulted from increased efficiency and productivity from our focus on automation and process primarily through our enterprise productivity to global business services revenue was billion which is down percent as reported and down percent at constant currency from a geographic perspective the growth markets turned in solid performance and the recovery in japan continued as they grew for the second consecutive at the gbs businesses by offering the growth initiatives continue to drive strong performance we had solid growth in business analytics smarter planet and cloud and for the year these initiatives now represent over one third of our total gbs revenue so as we retool the gbs business and mix to higher value work these larger more complex engagements are having a positive affect on gbs backlog in fact gbs backlog has now grown for the fourth consecutive year at constant currency though mixing to longer duration engagements and as i stated last quarter we have been taking actions to address the more traditional packaged application work we added partners to this base and have increased sales capability we targeted and closed large transformation opportunities in the growth markets and we have already seen some success in building the backlog in those areas this to profit gbs income was flat year to year and margin expanded a half point improved utilization and services delivery helped overcome the impact from year services backlog run total services we are providing you with additional detail around the projected total services revenue from backlog in this includes the impact to revenue from the work we done to restructure a number of lower margin contracts in our outsourcing business primarily in the us now keep in mind the revenue generated from backlog is approximately percent of total revenue in any year with the remainder coming from transactional signings in the year and sales and volumes in our existing client the projected revenue generated from backlog is up percent this includes percent growth from the backlog and a percent hurt from those restructured contracts but despite the impact to revenue growth these restructured contracts have lifted the profitability of the portfolio they provided substantial gross profit improvement in which carries through to and will contribute modest profit growth in off this higher profit for total services as we enter we will continue to drive our key plays and shift toward higher value content we will continue to invest in the growth markets which now represents over percent of total services revenue and is where we see the most opportunity for growth we will continue to be aggressive in transforming our portfolio to higher value content and away from the more commoditizing content our profit and margin performance will continue to benefit from work we are doing with research and software to infuse more and more ip into our offerings in addition services is the primary beneficiary of our focus on enterprise productivity overall we think we have a good set of opportunities to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion in revenue of billion was up percent or percent at constant key branded middleware grew percent at constant currency and gained share as we continued to be the clear leader in the middleware had continued momentum in our growth initiatives with strong performance in business analytics smarter commerce and cloud these initiatives cross all of our software results reflect the sustained investment in our strategic branded software in addition to our organic investments acquisitions provide additional capabilities while leveraging the existing portfolio of offerings for example in the first quarter of we acquired worklight a provider of mobile software which enables enterprises to manage and secure mobile applications worklight is now an important addition to our mobile strategy and has accelerated from a one million business when it was acquired to generating tens of millions for the year worklight is just one example of our ability to leverage and grow acquired businesses looking across our software portfolio we grew the transactional revenue of our acquisitions by nearly let me take you through the revenue drivers from a brand grew percent and continued to gain share continued to expand our portfolio to capture the emerging opportunity around mobile computing and saw significant uplift in some of our core websphere offerings such as application servers and commerce as a result we are to continue to help enterprises build connect run and manage their mobile management was up percent at constant currency and held share we had strong performance in information integration and predictive analytics both driven by big data tivoli software was up percent at constant currency and held share performance was led by our storage and our security offerings revenue from our storage portfolio was up percent at constant currency reflecting the value of storage software tivoli security was up percent at constant currency driven by labs which provides next generation security continue to transform the lotus portfolio to the social business offerings and consequently we had percent growth in lotus revenue gained share and had a great quarter this was driven by strong performance from our existing social business offerings and the recent acquisition of kenexa which we closed in december kenexa a leading provider of recruiting and talent management solutions helps clients create a more efficient and and brings a unique combination of technology and consulting services to an already extensive portfolio of social business posted growth of percent and gained had a solid quarter with revenue up percent at constant currency income up percent and margins up points the fourth quarter another good year for our software technology and technology delivered revenue of billion up percent adjusting for the divestiture of retail store solutions this performance was driven by our new mainframe and momentum in puresystems our expert integrated systems in fact in its introductory year we have already sold more than puresystems in more than z revenue grew percent driven by our first full quarter of our new mainframe mips grew percent year to year this is the largest quarter of mips shipments in history about half of these mips were specialty engines which were up percent year to year driven by linux workloads a good indicator of new workloads moving to the platform growth in z was over percent in the major markets and over percent in the growth markets in the growth markets we had strong sales to our established as well as new mainframe customers this performance reflects the technology leadership and value of our vertically integrated stack that ibm new flagship server is delivering to our customers it is simply the fastest and most capable enterprise system to to power while revenue was down percent our new and power servers performed well we will continue the refresh of the power portfolio in the first half of success in competitive take outs continued in the fourth quarter we had over competitive displacements resulting in over million of business about half of which came from and half from hp for the year we had nearly competitive displacements resulting in over billion of storage hardware revenue was down percent driven by tape disk was flat within disk we announced the new high end in october and it was sold out in the quarter this will continue to ramp in the first systems and technology income was up percent year to year driven by new product introductions in mainframe power storage and of course all of our segments the strong performance in our key growth initiatives these are not standalone offerings but integrated into our client offerings and included within our segment the growth markets our revenue is up percent at constant currency and countries now represent percent of ibm geographic revenue that up points since when we introduced our roadmap so we been very successful in capturing the opportunity in these faster growing doing this by continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out it infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key drive market expansion in we accelerated the opening of new branch offices this year we doubled the number of branches bringing the total number of and virtual branches in the growth markets to almost so this is tremendous business analytics initiative continues to expand allowing clients to make informed decisions everywhere in their organization to improve outcomes and to manage risk we made significant strides and expanded our leadership position in a number of strategic areas including risk management price and promotion optimization and sales performance management just to name a our value proposition in business analytics uniquely leverages the integration between our software portfolio and gbs consulting expertise this year business analytics grew percent led by our gbs consulting smartcloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements we seen continued strong demand for our foundational offerings in hardware and software that help companies build and run their private clouds as well as for solutions like our saas offerings with strong global growth our cloud revenue for the year was up percent in we launched our family of puresystems expert integrated systems as well as our smartcloud public and managed private cloud offerings for large enterprises these offerings further extend our cloud saw tremendous expansion of our smarter planet growth initiative over the last twelve months measured in

market segments social business where our social platform and kenexa come together in a powerful combination to allow our clients to engage a smarter more effective workforce smarter cities which includes a portfolio of solutions ranging from public safety to social services to intelligent water systems and finally our next generation analytics systems like watson which are helping tackle some of the most complex challenges facing our customers for the year our smarter planet solutions generated more than revenue you look at our offerings in business analytics cloud and smarter planet about half of our revenue is software so as these offerings become larger parts of the ibm business they driving a higher quality revenue stream improving our mix and our flow to cash flow we generated billion of free cash flow in the quarter that up almost line with past years about half of our annual cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter and on a basis we generated billion of free cash flow which is up billion over last year within our strong free cash flow performance our capital investments are up by almost million the improvement in free cash flow reflects our growth in net income and

balance sheet despite volatile market conditions in we had good returns on global assets exceeding our expected return on assets in the us and on a global basis but the discount rate environment remained challenging resulting in a billion impact to equity at the end of the year due to the pension liability remeasurement as a result our ended the year at percent up points year to year including a point impact from the pension the end of our defined plans continued to be well funded and our cash requirements remain stable we have included supplemental charts to cover ongoing dynamics of our pension plan our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have a high degree of financial eps bridge to now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings
