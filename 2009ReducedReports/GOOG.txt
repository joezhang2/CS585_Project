performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by

as operating income plus compensation and for the third quarter of the expense related to the settlement agreement with the authors guild and the aap operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation and events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fas google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus compensation and for the third quarter of the expense related to the settlement agreement and for the fourth quarter of impairment charges less the related tax effects of such items we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average shares on a basis outstanding as of december we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business net income and we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation the expense related to the settlement agreement in the third quarter of and the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with define the effective tax rates as income before income taxes adding back the expense related to the settlement agreement in the third quarter of the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of and compensation divided into the result obtained by subtracting the related tax benefits from our provision for income taxes we consider this financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of certain discrete items so that google management and investors can compare google recurring earnings results over multiple periods the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of the effective tax rates management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from the effective tax rates and evaluating the effective tax rates together with the effective tax rates computed on a gaap effective tax define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same

cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and operating income and operating they exclude the effect of compensation so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fas google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with we define net income as net income plus compensation less the related tax effects of such items we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions cash the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to

report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly new approach to many other organizations we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis in we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from china that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from google however it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incidentalbeit a significant onewas something quite this attack was not just on google as part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businessesincluding the internet finance technology media and chemical sectorshave been similarly targeted we are currently in the process of notifying those companies and we are also working with the relevant we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective only two gmail accounts appear to have been accessed and that activity was limited to account information such as the date the account was created and subject line rather than the content of emails as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on google we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of and gmail users who are advocates of human rights in china appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties these accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at google but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for google and for our users in terms of individual users we would advise people to deploy reputable and programs on their computers to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails or when asked to share personal information like passwords online you can read more here about our recommendations people wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this government report pdf nart villeneuve blog and this presentation on the ghostnet spying have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech in the last two decades china economic reform programs and its citizens entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of chinese people out of poverty indeed this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world launched in january in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in china and a more open internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results at the time we made clear that we will carefully monitor conditions in china including new laws and other restrictions on our services if we determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to china attacks and the surveillance they have uncoveredcombined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the webhave led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in china we have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law if at all we recognize that this may well mean having to shut down and potentially our offices in decision to review our business operations in china has been incredibly hard and we know that it will have potentially consequences we want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the united states without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in china who have worked incredibly hard to make the success it is today we are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues End_of_report 20100115 REPORT other

in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps and free cash flow the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures and reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation and events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fas google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to operating income and operating of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with we define net income as net income plus compensation and in the fourth quarter of impairment charges less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation and the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash accompanying tables have more details on the gaap financial measures that are most directly comparable to

in this release and in the attachments is as of april and google undertakes no duty to update this financial supplement our consolidated financial statements which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps and free cash flow the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures and reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation and events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus compensation less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business net income and we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to

the wifi data that our street view cars collect for use in products like google maps for mobile which enables people to find local restaurants or get directions his request prompted us to everything we have been collecting and during our review we discovered that a statement made in a blog post on april was that blog post and in a technical note sent to data protection authorities the same day we said that while google did collect publicly broadcast ssid information the wifi network name and mac addresses the unique number given to a device like a wifi router using street view cars we did not collect payload data information sent over the network but it now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wifi networks even though we never used that data in any google we will typically have collected only fragments of payload data because our cars are on the move someone would need to be using the network as a car passed by and our wifi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second in addition we did not collect information traveling over secure wifi how did this happen quite simply it was a mistake in an engineer working on an experimental wifi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast wifi data a year later when our mobile team started a project to collect basic wifi network data like ssid information and mac addresses using google street view cars they included that code in their softwarealthough the project leaders did not want and had no intention of using payload soon as we became aware of this problem we grounded our street view cars and segregated the data on our network which we then disconnected to make it inaccessible we want to delete this data as soon as possible and are currently reaching out to regulators in the relevant countries about how to quickly dispose of people trust is crucial to everything we do and in this case we fell short so we will be addition given the concerns raised we have decided that it best to stop our street view cars collecting wifi network data incident highlights just how publicly accessible open wifi networks are today earlier this year we encrypted gmail for all our users and next week we will start offering an encrypted version of google search for other services users can check that pages are encrypted by looking to see whether the url begins with https rather than just http browsers will generally show a lock icon when the connection is secure for more information about how to your network read engineering team at google works hard to earn your trustand we are acutely aware that we failed badly here we are profoundly sorry for this error and are determined to learn all the lessons we can

the attachments is as of july and google undertakes no duty to update this financial supplement our consolidated financial statements which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps and free cash flow the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures and reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation and events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus compensation less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash accompanying tables

google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first

exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our

by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to

can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for

privilege to work with these two gentlemen to continue to work with them and at this company that i have been really proud to be a part of all this eric you very much and as for myself i going to get a chance to work on the things that i am most interested in taking a more strategic view of things and i going to focus on customers partners various government communications external issues more than the internal issues that i have historically been focusing on so that is a significant i think improvement in the kind of things that i can do with my i want to say very clearly that i believe larry is ready he has been working on this area for a long time his ideas are very interesting and clever and it is time for him to have a shot at running this and doing it and i sure he will do a fantastic is interesting that a decade goes by very fast when you work in a partnership as wonderful as this has been and i quite sure that this partnership will continue we are friends we are coworkers we are computer scientists we have a common vision i do anticipate any material change in any of our strategies or anything we tend to agree on pretty much everything but i do believe that as a result of this we will operate and execute the business even with that i thought may be what we should do is have a few questions before we rush off and then patrick thank you so much for accommodating us on to your patrick is our pleasure jay if you do mind what we will do is we will set up two sets of questions for this afternoon we will just take a few questions now because we have larry sergey and eric and so we will take a few questions and then after that we will close that section of the call let them run back go back to work guys and then we will take the regular call as we usually proceed so jay if i can ask you to give us the instructions to take a couple of questions for eric larry and operator instructions james mitchell goldman james on the movements and congratulations on the results i guess one question i had just stemming from the results rather than from the movements perhaps is when i look at the investments in avenue in new york city do you feel that google is now at a point where in order to continue facilitating the growth of the internet that there will be a land grab for desirable physical locations larry think our primary reason for purchasing the building there was not the internet structure there but rather the office space that we really enjoy using the internet tenants are great tenants we appreciate having them there but that is not the primary reason why we purchased the wang credit spencer the big picture questions for eric you mentioned that one of your areas of focus will be on government outreach and it seems like google has may be come under a little bit more regulatory scrutiny over the past several years so i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your strategy with regulators to just ensure that google can continue to expand as necessary eric simple answer is that we are talking to them an awful lot of the problems that we have been having are people do actually understand what we really do and what we do do and some of our competitors are assisting in that so part of our core strategy is literally to communicate so what we are doing is we trying to be as transparent and collaborative as would tell you very clearly that the regulators have a proper job to do they are there for a reason and we respect that and so far we have been quite successful by just taking the time to get people to understand and we are sensitive to the close lines where we get too close to something and we try to stay away from that so we try to stay well within the safety zone of the way we are operating with respect to the legal issues and the competitive issues we also argue very strongly that the things we are doing are very and i genuinely believe that and i will be telling people a lot of that for a long time i khan imran to everybody a quick question larry as you become the ceo i think which is a very interesting juncture of google lifecycle and i think there is a lot of questions that we get from investors that the proliferation of social networking and how the traffic more and more traffic the social networking platforms are becoming so as google gets to the next level how do you think about the search and the social networking platforms becoming inaudible and the web applications and the mobile apps how do you think google becomes the point of place that you can send traffic to other places eric you have been driving most of this and may be larry you comment as sergey i think you pointed out two important trends i think one is the notion of and the other is the broad notion of social in terms of identity relationships and so forth and i think both of those are very important to search in fact you have seen over the past year or so us roll out functionality along those of all of course we have the updates now built into our search which includes twitter and other sources you have also seen us deploy social search which allows you to find search results that are related to people who you know and friends of their friends and so forth and you see those right in the main search results of the i think this is really just the tip of the iceberg and i think there is far more opportunity we have touched just of the capabilities that could be deployed in that realm and i think you should expect us to continue to develop those kind of eric did you want to add anything to that larry mean the last part of what sergey said really resonates with me i think that there is if you think about the next five years of what your life will be like online socially and what kind of things the tools will be able to do we are only at the very very early stages of that and i incredibly excited about the eric you i think we have time for one more question and i will just have a final post bank of justin have noticed a lot of changes on the site moving you farther down the purchasing funnel and we heard some regulatory pushbacks so may be this is a question for you eric but also potential some advertiser complaints so i was just wondering how the changes in your search ad results are they really driving your revenues and helping drive the strong growth and how are you dealing with advertisers in the regulatory environment on some of those changes that might be replacing some of the functionality of other websites eric is no question that our extraordinary results are partly coming from algorithmic improvements that we do all the time our basic strategy of course is to have the right ad in the right spot done exactly right every time and we do literally billions of these everyday and so that is the great magic of google if you have looked very very carefully at how we make the decisions as to which ads go where and so forth and we are pretty happy with the choice that we have made in terms of ranking ads and so forth there have been some competitor complaints and so forth of that and we have done a pretty thorough review but so far we are pretty happy with it and we think it will pass the necessary complaints and so forth that people are eric i think with that i think we have sort of run patrick is saying we have really run over our time i really appreciate everybody sort of letting us come in and do wanted to say to you that it has been a great privilege to be the ceo for years literally a decade and a decade is a long time to be a ceo so i very much looking forward to this new role more strategic role and something where i can work on some new things which i excited about and i even more looking forward to working with my literally best friends and partners larry and sergey and i hope you all understand how powerful this inaudible has been and how for us personally and how much it means to us as thank you all and patrick do you want to just sort of takeover patrick thank you so much larry sergey eric to take the time to join us this afternoon so with that what we will do is we are going to jump right into it and we will go to our more regular conversation so i will start with my opening remarks on the financials jonathan is going to give us his read of the year and then we will be joined by nikesh for our q a how else to talk about and as a phenomenal ending to a very good year at google i mean our incredibly strong performance in and overall is really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in the digital economy those trends they are fueling huge opportunities for innovation for growth both at google but also in the entire of these profound trends is the shift from advertising to online and it continues at quite a rapid clip and you have seen it fueling growth both in our core search business but across the board as well a case in point is revenue growth is in our core accelerated strongly in the second half of which is really particularly impressive if you think about it given that in was itself a very strong additions investments in our newer businesses the usual suspects of display mobile enterprise they are also in parallel creating a second powerful growth engine for google jonathan will give you more details on that in a minute but at a high level i just want to make it clear that how can we not be happy with the overall performance and trajectories of and on that basis be excited about our prospects for and beyond let me turn for the specifics of the performance of the quarter now let go through our revenue we grew year over year to billion our google websites revenue was up year over year to billion and we saw strength across most major geographies and verticals our adsense revenue was up year over year to billion again with continued strength in our google display network our other revenue was up to million our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong up year over year and up quarter over quarter this is really reflecting as i mentioned the accelerating shift of to online without a doubt as each year shows there is more and more holiday shopping happening online our aggregate cost per click growth also was pretty healthy up year over year and quarter over quarter and note that fx had a negative impact on cpc growth year over year although a positive impact quarter over quarter remember too that this is an aggregate number and that includes the and adsense i turn to our geographic performance the us and the rest of the world are both growing at a very healthy pace and our results clearly show that while the uk continued to lag a little bit in the global economic recovery revenue from the us was up just shy of at to billion and in our earnings slides that you can find on our investor website you will see that we have broken down our revenue by us uk and rest of world to show the impact of fx and the benefits from our hedging program so i encourage you to go to these slides for the exact international revenue accounted for of our revenue up or sorry billion and up year over year and it includes million of benefits from our hedging program so a relatively small number using fixed exchange rates though our international revenue would have been roughly million higher year over year as i said the uk was a little slower and it was up year over year to i turn to expenses traffic acquisition costs at billion or of advertising revenue other cost of revenue was million including compensation of million and finally all operating expenses totaled billion including approximately million in increase year over year in opex was primarily due to our increases in payroll advertising and promotion spend and professional services as a result of all of this our operating profit which excludes our compensation increased to billion in resulting in operating margin of our headcount was up approximately for the quarter and we ended the year roughly at effective tax rate you should note was in and this reflects the r d tax credit legislation that passed in december in the us and for which we recognized a full benefit in let me turn to cash management oi e was million per which reflects the continued good portfolio management performance and that was offset a little bit by our fas expenses for more detail again on oi e i would just encourage you to refer to the slides of the company this call and our ir site our operating cash flow was very strong at billion for the quarter capex for the fourth quarter was billion i mean obviously significantly above the last quarter but remember that the majority of this increase was from the purchase of the new york remaining balance was as usual primarily related to our datacenter and operations as a reminder we will continue to make significant capex investments and yet you have another data point to show that they do tend to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we are able to make these are very pleased with our free cash flow despite having purchased the office building in new york just shy of billion and the office building is obviously a with all this being said google is in an excellent financial performance for with incremental revenue for the year of billion and operating cash flow around billion that is a phenomenal performance plus a digital economy that is clearly on high gear so why in that context you can understand why we are so optimistic and it is with confidence that we are pursuing an aggressive growth talk about growth agenda means investing so here a couple of places where we have decided to invest and will continue to invest first we talked about the intense competition if you remember on our last call for labor so as part of the strategy to answer this challenge we have announced a compensation change in which will affect all of our employees we have made two changes to attract and retain the best we raised all base salaries by across the board in addition to that we shifted some compensation from bonus into base salary for and i repeat for which is which will result for them in more stable income for our employees and please note that all those changes are really becoming effective on january of this year so they are not included into our also that with salary increases come ripple effects such as k s or employee taxes or other that will actually flow through as well so if that is for compensation we have also made and continue to make strategic investments in sales and marketing for both new products but also advertiser acquisition product areas like chrome and chrome os which are such a part of our future follow our core philosophy of building these open platforms with big optionality and creating infrastructure where everybody on the web can succeed we will continue to push on those but also acquiring advertisers will and continues to remain a top are also investing in our infrastructure including both facilities and our core computing network as you have seen in the purchase of the new york city office was not only a wise investment but a clear commitment to our new york city site and frankly a reflection of our optimism about our growth in innovation is also about making tough choices and we have made them throughout as well by choosing to close products or initiatives that were not working as well as we would have liked or just had run their courses so for examples we did shut down the wave product and we have also shut down our consumer nexus in and also many other smaller projects that we would not talk usually on the call but things like and yes we are investing aggressively but with discipline really as we mentioned in the last call pouring a lot of resources on what we call our hockey sticks with a clear focus on roi and yes we will continue to invest heavily but with the same proven discipline and results that you have witnessed from us over the last few in summary we are incredibly pleased with our performance in optimistic about our trajectory for and beyond accordingly we continue to invest aggressively in a bold innovation with that i will turn it over to jonathan to speak about the product milestones in and and then we will take it over to q a jonathan all jonathan well thanks we certainly did have a great year at google and i would really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine when we hire product managers they often come in and they ask me they say so how do we measure success at google and i always tell them it is simple at the end of the year we make a list of all of your successes and your failures you are then measured on the sum of your successes and by how much you learn from your at the beginning of one of our concerns was that as we scaled this approach might lead to our being spread too thin instead we thought may be we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows so we made some changes and i think they address this concern without actually affecting the basic philosophy of how we have always run product engineering at let talk about what we changed at the beginning of the year we decided to double down on the core so that is search and search ads and i think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today reflect the fact that that was a success behind those numbers is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations for example we made a big effort this year to make search more interactive and you can see that with google instant and then more recently we made the previews instant as well and earlier in the year we launched new user interfaces for both web search and image search to make it easier and to make it more intuitive to work with the results after you run a search and we are also making search more intelligent we made several changes to results so now you can see things like a concert schedule or the answers to the questions highlighted right in the we are also now starting to roll out place search so when we know that you looking for something that is in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or something we will pull reviews webpages the address and a photo altogether for you we also double down on the ad side of the house in the past year we have launched several new ad formats which we have told you about site links seller rating ads recently we just added this product listing ads with photos and prices it makes sense that if i shopping for something like a coffee maker it is helpful to see more information in the the biggest boost of all came from good ad quality improvements was our best quarter in years from a quality standpoint we launched over updates which led to gains that were nearly double those that we would normally see in a strong although we have been at this for years we are still finding lots and lots of ways to make ads other change in was that several of our new businesses started to achieve escape velocity and our philosophy is to encourage lots of innovation and then we feed the winners and starve the losers and this creates kind of a darwinian but sort of googley environment in which new businesses emerge and grow and in it is really clear that some new winners started to display we now have over million publisher partners the number of transactions on the doubleclick ad exchange tripled and publishers who sell their ad space via the exchange are nearly tripling their revenue when the exchange wins the auction youtube revenue more than doubled we began adding features like live streaming to help partners deliver and ultimately of course to monetize content in new ways enterprise added impressive customers like the us government general services administration and we expanded distribution with partnerships like the deal with softbank in japan android now activating over phones per day this helped drive a increase in the volume of searches from android finally in i think we were more structured in our approach to our business the product and sales teams are working together more closely than ever thanks in large part to my buddy here nikesh patrick rigor helped us dynamically reallocate resources and as he mentioned cancel a few projects like wave and nexus one direct to consumer that were not achieving their what does all this mean for i think you can expect more of the same we are going to double down again on the core of search and search ads we are going to feed the winners display youtube enterprise and android and we are going to do it all with even greater financial rigor and coordination all over the i also excited about the prospect for a couple of our newest businesses local and commerce in local over million businesses have claimed their google place pages and we recently started testing a new ad product which we call boost and that gives businesses a really easy and fast way to promote themselves online and to connect with the people who are searching for commerce we are investing a lot to close the loop from online to shopping i think i have mentioned on four different earnings calls in the past couple of years the key to unlocking mobile commerce was to make it easier for people to both search and then to consummate their transaction from their mobile device someone on my team actually counted back on the calls and it was four times i think as smartphones become ubiquitous and local businesses put their inventory online i think this is the year where phones will play the big rolling commerce that i have long will be some important differences in we will invest in hiring even more product managers and engineers we are going to give them greater autonomy and we are going to push them to work faster in fact we are asking everyone here to do more and to do it the year we will tally our successes i sure you all will probably remind us of any failures so we can keep learning from them i hope you all now better understand our sense of optimism from a product perspective for i confident you guys will help us keep track of how this year product efforts play out on the important scorecard of financial a lot and back to patrick you jonathan now jonathan and i have made a nobel attempt on the back of the big announcement of today to keep your attention over the last minutes so i hope that you will have taken all the notes that you had to and now what we will do is we will turn it to jay nikesh is joining us so he is getting set up in his chair with his phone and we will turn it over to jay and we will go through the q a section of this give us the instructions operator instructions ben schachter ben on the quarter and the year jonathan i want to ask you a question about mobile and specifically how google thinks about the differences between tablet users and smartphone users and how those differences are really influencing the view of how you are viewing the overall evolving mobile market and then patrick if you could just address the sales and marketing line which i think was somewhat unexpectedly high jonathan we can take that in order i will go with the first question i think it is probably easier to talk about initially how tablets and smartphones are similar right both of them are growing at a terrific pace as is the case with mobile what we see on these devices is that search usage on the tablets tends to peak on the weekends and it dips on the weekdays so it is generally complementary to desktop which we have talked about before what does that suggest may be that people are using them more for personal usage as opposed to do see on tablets the weekend peak is a little bit more pronounced than it is on phones i think that is probably the case because people pretty much always carry their smartphone during the week some of the bigger differences the tablet users tend to search more for things like news and they tend to do more topics when you compare them to smartphone users i think there is some anecdotal data that they may convert better but i have not actually been through all of that in detail i tend to think that the tablets behave a little bit more like desktop devices than do smartphones because it is a little easier to input information into them like a credit think the other major difference is the ui approaches are different apps like the gmail app for the tablet is more designed for the big screen so i think they are both taking off and the revenue from tablets as well as smartphones reflects that patrick patrick i will take the second question if there is a good proof that we just do kind of like streamline our lines in terms of expenses but we go opportunistically in a smart move i think sales and marketing is a great example of that and then if you think of the last months what we have clearly shown is how much in high yield is the digital economy when that opportunity shows up we just needed to jump on it and decide to fuel it and on the marketing side and even on sales i mean i will ask nikesh to give you a bit of color on the sales side but on the marketing side when you have big platforms like chrome and chrome os that can and will be incredibly successful if promoted why would you do it now why i hear from the financial community the other side which is what are you doing with your money well we have great opportunities why would we jump on it with this kind of market and on the sales side nikesh you could probably give a color commentary as nikesh you patrick hi guys i think what is important here to understand we decided to put our foot to the pedal last year and there was an area of our customers that advertised we decided to continue to put more focus on which is the small to advertisers because that is where a lot of our growth engine is going to come from in the future and effectively a lot of the sales costs there are advertiser acquisition costs because as long as we bring them into our system they stay there for a while and they continue to work with us and continue to generate more revenues and some of the revenue performance you are seeing has been across the small channels the channels and that investment is already beginning to bear mahaney mark i can ask a question on the local advertising play it sounds like you have got a couple of products you have been working on rolling out for a while i think you also may have attempted an acquisition can you may be quantify the opportunity for us is this something that has always been a part of the buildup plan is there something you saw in the last months that really indicated that this was the time to accelerate the efforts against local advertising and then do you already feel like you have got all the assets now in place or are you still going to look for more assets in order to have that play viable patrick me just as a preamble we do not talk about m a local has always been part of our strategy and nikesh can talk about the initiatives or just about the initiatives we are doing there in terms of the boost in the products that you have or may be jonathan the boost products and just it is one more of the initiatives we have in local but local is just to kind of give a sense of framework it is one out of every five searches have some form of local kind of tendency or factor so it is not kind of a side event for us jonathan jonathan i think we have been very focused on local since going all the way back to may be my second year when we acquired keyhole here with google which was basically the original company that built google earth and really the idea was that ultimately the web should be this virtual mirror of the world at all times and that mirror of the world becomes much more useful when it is more relevant and it is more relevant to the users when you get everything organized around places in the physical i think the other thing which has come into play more recently is that technology has made it possible through the use of gps and smartphones for us to understand where you are and so i think what we have recognized more recently is that because smartphones have become deployed more aggressively that we can supply you with relevant information about the places that you are near with the appropriate search so if you at a restaurant you want to pull up a menu you do want just the menu that the waiter handed you you want the one in there that has the reviews and the picks from your i think what has basically changed over the course of the last year is it has become easier for local businesses to identify themselves in context on google and it has become easier for us to find out where you are and then of course we have mapped that with nikesh team which is working on selling boost and tags and some of the other ad formats that we have developed specifically for anmuth barclays doug can you talk a little bit more about your thoughts simply just around the new york headquarters i think this is the first time where you have actually really come out and confirmed the purchase and why do you need to own the new york headquarters rather than getting access to it in some other way and why is this a good use of capital then secondly can you just talk just following up on local discuss whether you really are building out more of a local salesforce in addition to obviously the local products themselves patrick will take the first and then i will let nikesh talk about the initiatives we are doing on the local side we have employees today in new york and our business and our engineering center it is a big engineering center by the way not only a big kind of sales center but it is a big engineering if you think of the eastern hub being that place with and growing at the pace at which we are growing it is actually very difficult to find in new york a place that would accommodate that number of employees in an environment that fits google standards and google needs we do not i mean we actually believe that living in a tower where there is a very small footprint on a floor to floor is terrible for the google there very few buildings in new york that actually can accommodate our needs replacing that building for us or moving out of there would actually be probably very difficult to find another place and then be prohibitively then finally it gives us a lot of control over growing into that space so all of this to say on top of what we believe will be is a very good investment so for all these reasons coming back to the previous it is not about carrier hotel owning it really is about the googleyness so for all these reasons i think it did make sense and we called it a item because it just fitted so well our the local salesforce i will turn it to nikesh to give you a bit more details on our nikesh think it is important to understand that local the way you define it actually ends up in three different interpretations one is we always had local features to our adwords products you can always localize your advertising towards users who are in certain areas certain territories so you always had the ability to other thing we have done in local is the way i think local is sometimes synonymous with smaller advertisers and smaller territories and towards that end we have created a more simplistic set of products around tags and boost which is more and more able to those advertisers they do have to do a lot of work sometimes they do even have their own website and that allows them to still participate in the online the third is that we have for the longest of times had partnerships with other companies who have been selling advertising on our behalf to smaller advertisers be it in small local areas or we have been using other partners who will use their salesforce it has brought on smaller advertisers for us so we are going to use a combination of all these three efforts to continue to pursue our local strategy going pitz brian would you give us a rough organic revenue growth rate excluding acquisitions and then secondly a question on ads are you guys seeing any competitive share shifts in dollars from search or display towards other social platforms or applications patrick on the second one i will let nikesh give you a sense on the first one i do have the breakdown we do provide the breakdown but i can tell you that all of our core properties are growing very well and not only our core properties but also our new growth businesses as well when you look at the numbers for just the growing year over year how can you not be happy with that kind of performance and so overall we are very pleased with our growth rate of revenue i will let nikesh talk about the second nikesh think it is important to understand that search for the longest of times has been performance advertising and so has a large chunk of display been performance advertising so the newer players you are talking about are sort playing the brand display space so overall if you look at it the stronger trend is shift of brand dollars from the world into the online world and can you shift some of those dollars sales and marketing dollars into advertising so we are seeing that shift both on our search side we are seeing that shift on our display side but also seeing some brand dollars on the search side and some brand dollars on the display i think it is more than fair to say that right now the bigger trend is the shift from to online and there has been less of an allocation of shift within the online world because all these measures all these means are measurable and you are seeing better roi for these measurable events in both display and performance search so that is what the trend sandler rbc capital ross questions first patrick a question on the display business if you look out and analyze the financial statements for just about any publicly traded ad network out there these businesses seem to peak out and the operating margins seem to peak out in the to range do you think there is anything structurally different about google approach in the display business that could allow google to achieve higher operating margins or is that just the peak for that kind of business model then nikesh just a quick question on the row acceleration so year over year can you talk a little bit about which regions that is coming from or is it across the board and is there any acceleration from new revenue areas like display or is it just the core search business patrick the first one let me answer the display and then i will let nikesh talk about the performance think in display the most fundamental issue is if you are on your own network or if you optimizing for other network and participating in others network so if you think of youtube it is our own property and therefore you have a completely different set of economics and so you just got to make sure you do compare apples and oranges so one obviously has a much higher margin than the other and the question then is the mix so if you think of us in display where we have the whole suite of services from what used to be teracent and all the other pieces then you have the mix of properties and that is how you have to think about terms of geographic split and performance i will let it is a fantastic story so why do i let nikesh give you the color commentary on nikesh before this adding to what patrick said on the display side i think it is also important to understand the contribution of the ad exchange it basically allows you to bring buyers and sellers together and we are seeing a serious uplift for people who are participating on the ad exchange in terms of you know whilst your traditional display business you might be seeing margin profiles are different and i can not predict future margin profiles but clearly there is an uplift and a benefit to advertisers who participate in the exchange so that has also been patrick it differently we have three sources nikesh because you have to add the ad exchange on nikesh so in terms of the sort of rest of the world performance i think there are some things notable this quarter in addition to our usual stalwarts where the us continues to be strong and the rest of the world is strong germany has maintained its strength because of its economic development which has been different from the rest of europe so that has showed up in our results as well i very particularly excited about some of the turnaround we have achieved in japan because we have been putting in a concerted effort over the last many months to try and put an aggressive foot out in the marketplace in terms of bringing in more partners more advertisers and generally upgrading the entire effort in japan from our side so we are seeing the results of addition to that some of the commodity markets markets where commodities are strong brazil australia some of those have been strong in general the uk continues to be weak as you noticed but that is a very strong market for us it is a big market for us as patrick closing on that topic i think it is worth noting if you do your financial math and you move rest of world into constant fx so if you take out the fact that we add crosswinds year over year in fact our growth rate for rest of world is over it is so again very good momentum devitt morgan scott click growth on a percentage basis was the highest rate in two years you mentioned a few things on the call better ads better targeting even local monetization i was just wondering to what extent some other factors came into play as well particularly google instant and the rollout of that product as well as the incremental nature of smartphone and tablet queries patrick so i think that for paid click growth you really have to look at a couple of factors i just want to start by debunking a myth on google instant everybody seems to have there is kind of a buzz out there that google instant is the driver for a lot of the revenue growth and in fact google instant is neutral it is not making any significant contribution to our revenue is really making the contribution is that there is really our growth is driven by three interdependent drivers that are all acting and fielding together one is clearly the strength of the economic recovery and the consumer shift online and you can look ever since thanksgiving and you have seen it from external sources as well people have moved online in addition to that we have a second compounding factor pounding on it which is platforms are changing the use of mobile phones ipads you know instant search too but also gao the fact that you get each instant location you can get coupons all these things from a platform perspective are driving it on top of then finally it is true that jonathan team fantastic job at making great ads tuning and monetization like the visible url and jonathan you may want to take a second to talk about this url it is those factors that are really driving the cpc growth and the rate growth rather than instant i just want to be clear because i know there is a rumor on the street running that it all about instant search and instant search is about the user it is people spending faster that is a huge number and that is why we did instant search so may be visible url is a good example that you want to talk about jonathan sure i guess other than the ad quality improvements which i can cover in a second i think the only other area that patrick did not cover would basically just be the new ad formats all of which are boosting click through rates and i mentioned those in my prepared remarks the product listing ads more recently offer ads ads the seller ratings which we have also launched have significant impact in rates as low as does site i think that probably the most significant thing in terms of what impacted the whole ad area this quarter was this concept that we call visible url and basically what we did was on the top ads we moved the advertiser url down to its own separate line below the creative rather than having it be part of the creative and that obviously made it easier for people to see where they will go if they click it is actually a little bit of an interesting story i will give you some of the background on this because i think this is by far the most significant change that we have from an ad quality perspective in a very long turned out early in the quarter some of the engineers in japan noticed that it was really hard to recreate it because we actually had the ad url which was in latin characters mixed in with the ad creative which was in kanji and it did not really take brilliant research to figure out that human perception gets really confused when characters switch like that in the middle of a sentence people just sort of skip the whole sentence and if they skip something that is sort of really bad when that sentence is a text we ran this experiment in japan and we moved the url down to its own line and rates went up dramatically so we launched that feature pretty expeditiously in i think japan china korea and russia and then what happens is the engineers kind of said well hey just for fun let try that in the rest of the world and we actually did not expect so much because we did not have the same dynamic of latin characters versus kanji but it turned out that people skipped sentences with long unusual words in it so people were tuning out that line and we quickly launched this feature globally it was one of the fastest things that we ever launched after the ad testing i believe we launched it right around thanksgiving and that had a very significant change in the clicks that we saw in the course of the patrick just to close on that just to kind of say it is and i know that jonathan has used that trumpet a number of times in the past but it just continues to illustrate how much more innovation there is left in both formats and in just all of the things that we do in terms of innovation in the ad patel deutsche jeetil we look at your the revenue line from a customer base standpoint whether it is fortune or ad age versus internet endemics and then the small to business category i guess the smb category was weaker as opposed to during the credit crisis and had a hard time coming back i curious as to your thoughts as to how it is coming back today do you think there is a different way of approaching that smb market as you look ahead into this year and going forward in terms of products or may be ways to help drive leads or sales for that segment of the market patrick will let nikesh answer that question just one point of clarification on your statement though and during the recession a couple of years ago i think you mentioned that we thought that smbs were kind of going down and in fact nikesh will clarify that they were going the other way so nikesh i will leave it to you to answer the nikesh think the important thing to understand is that we are seeing such a disproportionate amount of strength from the very large advertisers across the board because effectively what is happened over the years is that they have gone out and really strengthened their offerings they have gotten their act together they have got all the logistics in place given that this was the quarter of christmas and thanksgiving you saw tremendous amounts of strength from large advertisers wanting to play against the internet in addition to that what has also happened is we have put in efforts over the last six months on the smb and midmarket side on the midmarket side we have basically gone ahead and adopted a higher touch strategy we spent more time on the phone with our customers we even go and visit some of our customers because to be fair over the years they have grown to be larger customers than they used to be in the past so we have put in sort of a conscious higher touch last but not least with the smaller advertisers we are working very closely with our product team and jonathan and his team to try and look at various systemic and algorithmic improvements we can make working with them in large direct marketing campaigns where we can continue to reduce churn in that area and continue to acquire more which is related to the earlier comment on slightly higher sales spending on trying to acquire smaller advertisers so we have that source across the board across all three categories we do think that effort is done and fully over jeetil you think the business model or pricing model has to be different there whether it is percentage of sales or some other kind of approach to going after the spend in that segment patrick think to be fair if you look at some of the simplification we have done on the adwords side on our local products which is another way of thinking about smaller advertisers that is a way to create a simpler product for them where they do have to put in a lot more effort or we have things like keyword less ads so they do have to go ahead and work towards creating keywords or we have to go out on the display side we have got contextual targeting where we can create ad groups very very we may continue to make product improvements which allow things to become more and more simple so advertisers can go and do their daily business as opposed to spend time understanding more complicated stuff on our side so yes you are right they are different simpler products we create for them which has slightly different pricing so that they can continue to participate in the online maynard wells fargo jason had a question just on the mobile business last quarter obviously saw some increased momentum i curious just from a pricing perspective what you starting to see from advertisers and what kind of progress did you see over the last days and may be more importantly as nfc starts to become more prevalent in smartphones i mean how do you think that changes the dynamic in terms of what type of effective monetization you are going to see from the local commerce side patrick let me give you just a few statistics to continue to keep the context mobile search grew times on mobile devices with web browsers in the last year so there is no doubt that this market is just absolutely cranking and there is a lot of work and i will let jonathan talk about it about how ad formats are still kind of nascent and building both on the display side and on the regular side and we see a lot of you probably want to cover jonathan you know we do really actually break out the details in terms of the exact differences certainly the ads are generating millions of calls every month a lot of advertisers are running these campaigns i think one you can see if you try it is did launch a call only option where the only clickable link in the ad is actually a phone number which not surprisingly substantially increases the rates on mobile devices and we have extended some of the desktop formats pretty successfully to mobile site links is one if you try a query on oakley you will see one if you try seller ratings on something like running shoes so i think there is a lot more to learn there but the advertisers are very excited and the moment i do have any specific comments on nfc other than to go back to the statements that i made in previous calls which is when people are completing transactions with these devices it becomes much more trackable and obviously significantly more weinstein pacific steve you commented that you were going to be shifting more compensation to base pay from bonus i was wondering if you could let us know what the ratio had been historically as far as those two components of comp then finally obviously the acceleration in all the metrics is pretty exciting and pretty positive for the outlook i was wondering if you could help us understand though how much acceleration is happening within the core business and how much of the acceleration is may be some of the newer businesses really starting to get some scale and may be tipping the overall momentum in the business patrick you for the question on compensation first as i said we raised all salaries so if you think of financial modeling for a second all salaries have been raised january and that has a ripple effect on the kind of ripple effect of the employee taxes k s and all the rest of the will also impact obviously everybody that we will bring on this year as well so as we bring in new people they are costing us now slightly addition to that what we have done is part of the bonus is kind of calculated without giving you the exact number we had two components to our annual bonus one which is a company multiplier and one which is an individual multiplier and what we have done for the because we want execs to actually continue to be treated differently the are treated in that what used to be the company multiplier which they did not really have a lot of influence on we shifted over to base pay and their individual multiplier component of the bonus continues to be a very directly involved into their calculation of their personal by shifting that company multiplier which they did not have a lot of influence on it just moves it into more predictable cash flows for them all through the year rather than waiting for the end of the year that was the rationale for doing terms of revenue growth i mean last quarter we gave two indication points on display on mobile we have talked about the fact that our core if you look at our enterprise business of million users million businesses on apps the kind of magnitudes of numbers we are talking about in each of our growth areas whether it be mobile whether it be android whether it be youtube where we continue to have youtube right i mean to give you a snippet youtube revenue more than doubled in that is why we are optimistic across the board and that is why we are very kind of open about the fact when you have such a digital economy running in high gear why do you take the opportunity to invest at the time where it is actually transforming itself and that is what we are doing and we are delighted in fact to continue to push hard on that and that what you see also in sales and thanks for your that let me reiterate and so to them thank you so much for your fantastic efforts in we are just set up for a fantastic that i will let jay close the does conclude today conference we thank you for your End_of_report 20110124 REPORT departure of directors

financial statements which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps and free cash flow the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of to the nearest comparable gaap measures and reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus compensation less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis net income and these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash accompanying tables have more details on the gaap financial measures that are most directly comparable to financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial relations of

and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and reconciliation from gaap international revenues to international revenues included in the accompanying financial use these financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as compensation but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus compensation operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of compensation so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely compensation that are recurring compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second compensation is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus compensation less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with compensation without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash we define international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter we consider international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management internal comparison to our historical international accompanying tables have more details on the gaap financial measures that are most directly comparable to financial measures and the related reconciliations

is as of october and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by financial supplement our consolidated financial statements which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps free cash flow and international revenues the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations measures to the nearest comparable gaap measures reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and reconciliation from gaap international revenues to international revenues included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as sbc but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable events operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of sbc and as applicable events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes sbc allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely sbc that are recurring sbc has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second sbc is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable events less the related tax effects we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with sbc without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash we define international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter we consider international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management internal comparison to our historical international

our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as sbc but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable events operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of sbc and as applicable events so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes sbc allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely sbc that are recurring sbc has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second sbc is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable events less the related tax effects the tax effect of sbc is calculated using the portion of sbc and applying the federal and blended state tax rates we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with sbc without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to

of total revenues unaudited letter our evolution from privately held to large publicly listed company we have managed google for the long termenjoying tremendous success as a result especially since our ipo in sergey and i hoped though we did not expect that google would have such significant impact and this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world our enduring love for google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people lives in deep and meaningful ways to fulfill these dreams we need to ensure that google remains a successful growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone we went public we created a voting structure our goal was to maintain the freedom to focus on the long term by ensuring that the management team in particular eric sergey and i retained control over google destiny as we explained in our founders are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons by investing in google you are placing an unusual long term bet on the team especially sergey and me and on our innovative want google to become an important and significant institution that takes time stability and the transition to public ownership we have set up a corporate structure that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence google this structure will also make it easier for our management team to follow the long term innovative approach emphasized main effect of this structure is likely to leave our team especially sergey and me with increasingly significant control over the company decisions and fate as google shares change investors will fully share in google long term economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting colleagues will be able to trust that they themselves and their labors of hard work love and creativity will be well cared for by a company focused on stability and the long an investor you are placing a potentially risky long term bet on the team especially sergey and me sergey and i are committed to google for the long wanted to quote all that because these were the clear expectations we established for investors in while this decision was controversial at the time we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do eight years later these statements are still remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits as a result given google success it unsurprising that this type of governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology our experience success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential for example it took over three years just to ship our first android handset and then another three years on top of that before the operating system truly reached critical mass these kinds of investments are not for the have protected google from outside pressures and the temptation to sacrifice future opportunities to meet demands product investments like chrome and youtube which now enjoy phenomenal usage were made with a significant degree of have a structure that prevents outside parties from taking over or unduly influencing our management decisions however dilution from routine employee compensation and other possible dilution such as acquisitions will likely undermine this structure and our aspirations for google over the very long term we have put our hearts into google and hope to do so for many more years to come so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the a stock split and a new class of we announced plans to create a new class of capital stock which will be listed on nasdaq these shares will be distributed via a stock dividend to all existing stockholders the owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the stock giving investors twice the number of shares they had before it effectively a stock splitsomething many of our investors have long asked us for these shares will be available for corporate uses like employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance recognize that some people particularly those who opposed this structure at the start wo support this changeand we understand that other companies have been very successful with more traditional governance models but after careful consideration with our board of directors we have decided that maintaining this approach is in the best interests of google our shareholders and our users having the flexibility to use stock without diluting our structure will help ensure we are set up for success for decades to november sergey and i published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in we are currently halfway through those plans and we do expect any changes to that certainly not as the result of this new potential class we both remain very much committed to google for the long important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term in fact there no particular urgency to make these changes nowwe do have an unusually big acquisition planned in case you were wondering it just that since we know what we want to do there no reason to delay the decision also note that there will be no immediate change in votes because everyone will still have the same number in addition eric sergey and i have all agreed to stapling arrangements so that above set thresholds if our economic interest in google were to decline our votes would as well we also have provisions to ensure all shareholders are treated fairly from an economic more details on all of this please see the postscript below from our chief legal officer david drummond and the preliminary proxy statement we will file with the sec next have always managed google for the long term investing heavily in the big bets we hope will make a significant difference in the world some of these bets have been tremendous funding our activities and generating significant gains for our shareholders others have been less successful but the ability to take these kinds of risks has been crucial to google overall success and we aim to maintain this pioneering culture going proposal we announced today is consistent with the governance philosophy we articulated when we took the company public as well as the trend for newer technology companies to adopt strong structures we believe that it will provide great competitive strengthinsulating google from pressures whatever the source for a long time to come while also giving us more flexibility around equity and others have always taken a big bet on us the founders and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes we are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and we recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders we think this is a good thing because users rely on google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data this is our and i share a profound belief in the potential for technology to improve people lives and we are enormously excited about what lies ahead i could write a better conclusion to this founder letter than what we wrote in so here goes have a strong commitment to our users worldwide their communities the web sites in our network our advertisers our investors and of course our employees sergey and i and the team will do our best to make google a long term success and the world a better from david drummond chief legal officer google is not the usual yada yada so please read we be filing a comprehensive proxy statement soon i wanted to share some details about today proposal to create a new class of stock and the process our board of directors followed to approve larry and sergey note above the stock dividend we are announcing today will have the basic effect of a stock split each holder of a share of class a or class b common stock will receive one share of the new class c capital stock so after the dividend a stockholder who currently owns one class a share with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one class c share without a class a shares will continue to trade under the goog ticker symbol while the class c shares will trade under a different ticker symbol so stockholders will be able to trade these shares just as they can with class a shares today except for voting rights the class c shares will have the same rights as the existing class a and class b shares as is typically the case with stock splits the class c stock dividend will be thing to keep in mind is that immediately after the class c dividend all stockholders including larry sergey and eric will retain the same voting interest they hold prior to the dividend in addition larry sergey and eric have agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement this agreement will maintain the same link between their voting and economic interests that exists today even if they sell some of their class c shares if the founders or eric wish to sell or transfer their class c shares a stapling provision in the agreement requires them to either sell an equal number of class b shares or convert an equal number of class b shares into class a shares no other stockholders will be subject to these restrictions upon the transfer or sale of their shares the stapling requirement will terminate as to the founders when their collective ownership falls below a certain threshold and as to eric when his ownership falls below a certain threshold further details of the transfer restriction agreement will be included in our proxy but it important to note that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to the thresholds the votes held by the founders and eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company board of directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision in january the board established a special committee comprised of independent board members to consider a new class of stock or other alternatives this committee retained its own financial and legal advisers to assist with its deliberations and met on numerous occasions over the months that the special committee considered the proposal separately from the board the committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today proposal is subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of google common stock voting together as a single class at our annual meeting on june given that larry sergey and eric control the majority of voting power and support this proposal we expect it to pass the board of directors has not set a record date for the issuance of the class c dividend and currently expects to set the date following the annual week we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec which will contain further details regarding today legal officer google is this different from what we have today googlers hold two types of stock class a stock which has one vote per share this is the type of stock that most googlers hold in gsus and stock options and class b stock which has votes per share the vast majority of which is held by larry sergey and eric currently the equity grants we make to employees new hire and equity refresh grants are based in class a shares if the proposal is approved we have three types of stock class a stock and class b stock which retain their voting rights and a new class c stock which would have no voting rights in general going forward all employee equity award grants are expected to be issued in class c does this mean if i have unvested gsus what

general instruction below form is being filed as an amendment to the current report on form filed by google with the securities and exchange commission on april the sole purpose of this amendment no is to add a solicitation legend to the end of exhibit pursuant to rule under the securities exchange act of as amended no other changes have been made to the original no to the requirements of the securities exchange act of as amended the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly letter our evolution from privately held to large publicly listed company we have managed google for the long termenjoying tremendous success as a result especially since our ipo in sergey and i hoped though we did not expect that google would have such significant impact and this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world our enduring love for google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people lives in deep and meaningful ways to fulfill these dreams we need to ensure that google remains a successful growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone we went public we created a voting structure our goal was to maintain the freedom to focus on the long term by ensuring that the management team in particular eric sergey and i retained control over google destiny as we explained in our founders are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons by investing in google you are placing an unusual long term bet on the team especially sergey and me and on our innovative want google to become an important and significant institution that takes time stability and the transition to public ownership we have set up a corporate structure that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence google this structure will also make it easier for our management team to follow the long term innovative approach emphasized main effect of this structure is likely to leave our team especially sergey and me with increasingly significant control over the company decisions and fate as google shares change investors will fully share in google long term economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting colleagues will be able to trust that they themselves and their labors of hard work love and creativity will be well cared for by a company focused on stability and the long an investor you are placing a potentially risky long term bet on the team especially sergey and me sergey and i are committed to google for the long wanted to quote all that because these were the clear expectations we established for investors in while this decision was controversial at the time we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do eight years later these statements are still remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits as a result given google success it unsurprising that this type of governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology our experience success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential for example it took over three years just to ship our first android handset and then another three years on top of that before the operating system truly reached critical mass these kinds of investments are not for the have protected google from outside pressures and the temptation to sacrifice future opportunities to meet demands product investments like chrome and youtube which now enjoy phenomenal usage were made with a significant degree of have a structure that prevents outside parties from taking over or unduly influencing our management decisions however dilution from routine employee compensation and other possible dilution such as acquisitions will likely undermine this structure and our aspirations for google over the very long term we have put our hearts into google and hope to do so for many more years to come so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the a stock split and a new class of we announced plans to create a new class of capital stock which will be listed on nasdaq these shares will be distributed via a stock dividend to all existing stockholders the owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the stock giving investors twice the number of shares they had before it effectively a stock splitsomething many of our investors have long asked us for these shares will be available for corporate uses like employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance recognize that some people particularly those who opposed this structure at the start wo support this changeand we understand that other companies have been very successful with more traditional governance models but after careful consideration with our board of directors we have decided that maintaining this approach is in the best interests of google our shareholders and our users having the flexibility to use stock without diluting our structure will help ensure we are set up for success for decades to november sergey and i published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in we are currently halfway through those plans and we do expect any changes to that certainly not as the result of this new potential class we both remain very much committed to google for the long important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term in fact there no particular urgency to make these changes nowwe do have an unusually big acquisition planned in case you were wondering it just that since we know what we want to do there no reason to delay the decision also note that there will be no immediate change in votes because everyone will still have the same number in addition eric sergey and i have all agreed to stapling arrangements so that above set thresholds if our economic interest in google were to decline our votes would as well we also have provisions to ensure all shareholders are treated fairly from an economic more details on all of this please see the postscript below from our chief legal officer david drummond and the preliminary proxy statement we will file with the sec next have always managed google for the long term investing heavily in the big bets we hope will make a significant difference in the world some of these bets have been tremendous funding our activities and generating significant gains for our shareholders others have been less successful but the ability to take these kinds of risks has been crucial to google overall success and we aim to maintain this pioneering culture going proposal we announced today is consistent with the governance philosophy we articulated when we took the company public as well as the trend for newer technology companies to adopt strong structures we believe that it will provide great competitive strengthinsulating google from pressures whatever the source for a long time to come while also giving us more flexibility around equity and others have always taken a big bet on us the founders and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes we are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and we recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders we think this is a good thing because users rely on google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data this is our and i share a profound belief in the potential for technology to improve people lives and we are enormously excited about what lies ahead i could write a better conclusion to this founder letter than what we wrote in so here goes have a strong commitment to our users worldwide their communities the web sites in our network our advertisers our investors and of course our employees sergey and i and the team will do our best to make google a long term success and the world a better from david drummond chief legal officer google is not the usual yada yada so please read we be filing a comprehensive proxy statement soon i wanted to share some details about today proposal to create a new class of stock and the process our board of directors followed to approve larry and sergey note above the stock dividend we are announcing today will have the basic effect of a stock split each holder of a share of class a or class b common stock will receive one share of the new class c capital stock so after the dividend a stockholder who currently owns one class a share with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one class c share without a class a shares will continue to trade under the goog ticker symbol while the class c shares will trade under a different ticker symbol so stockholders will be able to trade these shares just as they can with class a shares today except for voting rights the class c shares will have the same rights as the existing class a and class b shares as is typically the case with stock splits the class c stock dividend will be thing to keep in mind is that immediately after the class c dividend all stockholders including larry sergey and eric will retain the same voting interest they hold prior to the dividend in addition larry sergey and eric have agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement this agreement will maintain the same link between their voting and economic interests that exists today even if they sell some of their class c shares if the founders or eric wish to sell or transfer their class c shares a stapling provision in the agreement requires them to either sell an equal number of class b shares or convert an equal number of class b shares into class a shares no other stockholders will be subject to these restrictions upon the transfer or sale of their shares the stapling requirement will terminate as to the founders when their collective ownership falls below a certain threshold and as to eric when his ownership falls below a certain threshold further details of the transfer restriction agreement will be included in our proxy but it important to note that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to the thresholds the votes held by the founders and eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company board of directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision in january the board established a special committee comprised of independent board members to consider a new class of stock or other alternatives this committee retained its own financial and legal advisers to assist with its deliberations and met on numerous occasions over the months that the special committee considered the proposal separately from the board the committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today proposal is subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of google common stock voting together as a single class at our annual meeting on june

results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our class a common related to our business and face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and is subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users and delivering innovative products and technologies to the marketplace with our acquisition of motorola mobility holdings motorola the competitive pressure to innovate will now encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines vertical search engines and sites social networking sites traditional media companies wireless mobile device companies and providers of online products and services our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions investing aggressively in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search online advertising wireless mobile devices and products and services the research and development of new technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment as well as the accurate anticipation of technology market trends and consumer needs as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use if we are unable to provide quality products and services then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline and affect consumer and advertiser perceptions of our brand in addition these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies products services and technologies such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating and investments could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations we also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks include failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or of goodwill any of which could harm our financial condition or results also the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our generated of google revenues in and in the three months ended march from our advertisers following our acquisition of motorola we still expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from advertising our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads and ultimately customers or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner if we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers they may stop placing ads with us which would adversely affect our revenues and addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition changes in our product mix query growth rates and how consumers make queries the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels the increasing maturity of the online advertising market and the other markets in which we participate and the success of our investments in new business strategies products services and technologies such as our acquisition of revenue growth rate of our motorola business will also depend on a number of factors including our reliance on several large customers the absence of motorolas any of these factors could have a exclusivity arrangements with such customers our ability to gain significant market share in the mobile devices space our reliance on distributors representatives and retailers to sell certain of its products and the successful implementation of our product and operating system strategies furthermore industry consolidation in the telecommunications and cable industries could negatively because there would be fewer network operators and it could be more difficult to replace any lost impact and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business including motorola for instance our operating margin will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products including google the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members and the margin on revenues from our motorola business is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites also the margins on advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown in particular we are cooperating with the regulatory authorities in the united states and abroad including the federal trade commission ftc the european commission ec and several state attorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition legislators and regulators including those conducting investigations in the and europe may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices these changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust such as the pending investigations by the ftc and the ec intellectual property privacy tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters our acquisition of motorola also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving in addition our motorola business faces intellectual property litigation as further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell motorola about product defects as well as health and safety hazardous materials usage and other environmental claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results can not be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action or requiring development of or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers google network members and other brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the google brand is critical to expanding our base of users advertisers google network members and other partners we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including data protection and security issues service outages and product malfunctions if we fail to maintain and enhance the google brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide innovative products and services which we may not do variety of new and existing and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our are subject to numerous and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies the laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the and abroad claims have also been or may be threatened and filed against us under both and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users moreover recent amendments to patent laws will become effective in and may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent addition the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for caching or hosting or for listing or linking to websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us various and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors in the area of data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act we face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the technology and media companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies including android google search google adwords google adsense motorola google books google news google image search google chrome google talk google voice and youtube infringe the intellectual property rights of others adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against motorola by filing claims in the international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell motorola products in the or elsewhere if our products or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims addition many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover supplier provided intellectual property indemnities to us when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from malfunctioning of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover because of our interests in open source we may not have adequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the and internationally claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright or trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort including personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information which we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties including our users in addition we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and international also arrange for the distribution of advertisements to publishers and advertising networks and we offer products services or content we may be subject to claims concerning these products services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing branding broadcasting or providing access to them even if we do not ourselves host operate provide or provide access to these products services or content defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet if users do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets video game consoles and television devices has increased dramatically in the past few years the lower resolution functionality and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers distributors and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and time to time concerns have been expressed by regulators and others about whether our products services or processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about or regulatory actions involving our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect operating results while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies the failure or perceived failure to comply may result and in some cases has resulted in inquiries and other proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose users and customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our addition as nearly all of our products and services are the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business we expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of products and services we offer and operate in more authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our our acquisition of motorola we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results and our acquisition of motorola we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management for instance products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our motorola products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively on third parties to manufacture many of motorolas assemblies and finished products and we have arrangements for the design of some components and parts our motorola business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other materials terms of our arrangements with like many electronics manufacturers has also experienced supply shortages and price increases in the past driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of its suppliers workaround plans to address shortages have entailed in the past and could entail in the future increased freight costs for expedited shipments we can not assure you that we will not experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future or that they will not negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our motorola products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we can not assure you that we would be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain because many of our supply contracts have pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our motorola sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our motorola products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our wall street reform and consumer protection act included disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals while final rules are not yet implemented these rules could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide us drc conflict free components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our our security measures are breached or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or our users or customers data our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users or customers data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and spam and content farms could decrease our search quality which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engines quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them although web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately we continuously combat web spam including through indexing technology that makes it harder for less useful web content to rank highly we have also improved our ability to detect hacked websites a major source of web spam in we face challenges from and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of content to help them improve their search rankings in we launched several algorithmic changes focused on websites if web spam and content farms continue to increase on google this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites in addition as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce content this may in the short run reduce our adsense revenues since some of these websites are adsense or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks floods fires power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes our data centers are also subject to sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services or damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our services which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business operating results and financial international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to further expand internationally international revenues accounted for approximately of our total google revenues in and in the three months ended march and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the in certain international markets we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any advantages or otherwise motorola business also has many manufacturing research and development administrative and sales facilities outside the and more than half of our motorola employees are employed outside the most of our motorola suppliers operations are outside the and nearly all of our motorola products other than some prototypes are manufactured outside the primarily in china taiwan and our manufacturing in these regions is disrupted our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted we require these suppliers and business partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws regulations and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if one of these suppliers or business partners violates labor or other laws or implements practices that are regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if one of our suppliers or business partners fails to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties any of these events could have a negative impact on our financial results and in connection with our operations in brazil we have had and continue to have legal disputes and controversies including tax labor and trade compliance controversies and other legal matters that take many years to resolve we incur legal and other costs in managing and defending these matters and expect to continue to incur such costs based on our assessment of these matters we have recorded reserves on only a small portion of the total potential exposure it is however very difficult to predict the outcome of legal disputes and controversies including litigation in brazil and our ultimate exposure may be greater than our current assessments and related addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following addition compliance with complex foreign and laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our motorola business has had and continues to have a policy requiring our suppliers business partners and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and motorolas code of business conduct regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents owned by third parties legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties any of these events could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations and harm our since we conduct business in currencies other than dollars but report our financial results in dollars we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income additionally hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of we were to lose the services of larry sergey eric or other key personnel we may not be able to execute our business future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team in particular larry page and sergey brin are critical to the overall management of google and the development of our technology along with our executive chairman eric schmidt they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are employees and we do not maintain any life insurance policies the loss of key personnel could seriously harm our rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users internet access providers may be able to block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and service providers some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers thereby harming our revenues and technologies could block our ads which would harm our have been developed including by us that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users as a result such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment the global nature of our business we have investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control as a result comparing our operating results on a basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations any of these events could cause our stock price to fall each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results our business is changing and evolving

with motorola solutions if the merger or subsequent transactions were to cause the spinoff of motorola from motorola solutions the spinoff to fail to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax connection with the spinoff motorola and motorola solutions entered into a tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement under which motorola agreed not to take any of certain actions during the period ending january without the receipt of a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service or an opinion of tax counsel in either case acceptable to motorola solutions in its discretion to the effect that such action will not affect the status of the spinoff and certain related transactions or the waiver by motorola solutions of the requirement to obtain the private letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel wachtell lipton rosen katz issued an opinion to motorola and to motorola solutions dated august to the effect that based on representations made by motorola and motorola solutions and subject to the limitations and qualifications set out in the opinion the acquisition of motorola will not affect the status of the spinoff and certain related transactions motorola solutions accepted that opinion as satisfying the requirements of the tax sharing agreement with respect to the acceptance of the opinion by motorola solutions under the tax sharing agreement which remains in effect motorola must indemnify motorola solutions and its affiliates against any and all liabilities incurred by them relating to the spinoff and certain related transactions to the extent caused by motorola this obligation is not capped and could subject motorola to substantial liabilities moreover restrictions under the tax sharing agreement may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions with respect to motorolas stock or assets or to engage in new business or other transactions intended to maximize the value of motorolas related to ownership of our trading price for our class a common stock may continue to be volatile and if the creation of our proposed class of class c capital stock is approved by stockholders and shares of the new class are distributed as expected the trading price of that class may also be volatile and may affect the trading price for the class a common trading price of our class a common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile for example from january through march the closing price of our class a common stock ranged from per share to per share the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include among others addition we recently announced a proposal to create a new class of capital stock known as the class c capital stock to help us manage the dilutive impact of additional equity issuances in financing and acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs although the proposal is subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders larry and sergey will have the power based on the size of their beneficial ownership of our class a and class b common stock to approve the proposal without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder they and eric have also indicated their intention to vote in favor of the proposal we also announced the intention of our board of directors if the proposal is approved to consider a distribution of shares of the class c capital stock as a dividend to our holders of class a and class b common we plan to list the class c capital stock on the nasdaq stock market we can not predict whether or to what extent a liquid trading market will develop for the class c capital stock if it does not or if the class c capital stock is not attractive to targets as an acquisition currency or to our employees as an incentive we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class as in the case of the class a common stock the trading price for the class c capital stock may also be volatile and affected by the factors noted above as well as by the difference in voting rights as between the class a common stock and the class c capital stock the volume of class c capital stock available for public sale and sales by us and our stockholders of class c capital stock including by institutional investors that may be unwilling unable or choose not to hold shares they receive as part of the stock dividend if it is declared and paid whether or not the class c capital stock is included in stock indices in the future may also affect the trading prices of the class a common stock and the class c capital addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our class a common stock and if approved and issued our class c capital stock regardless of our actual operating concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate class b common stock has votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share as of march larry sergey and eric beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding class b common stock representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock larry sergey and eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition as noted above we have announced a proposal to create the class c capital stock and the intention of our board of directors to consider a stock dividend of shares of this new class because the class c capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c capital stock including in future acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders together with eric they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving google including an acquisition of google by another company concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and as a result we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial as a result the market price of our class a common stock and if approved and issued our class c capital stock could be adversely in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management these provisions include the following a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or

excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as sbc but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of sbc and as applicable other special items so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes sbc allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely sbc that are recurring sbc has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second sbc is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items less the related tax effects the tax effects of sbc and as applicable other special items are calculated using the portion of sbc and as applicable other special items and applying the federal and blended state tax rates we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with sbc and as applicable other special items without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results net income and limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash we define international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using

prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps free cash flow and international revenues the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of selected financial measures to the nearest comparable gaap financial measures reconciliations of results of operations measures nearest comparable gaap measures reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and reconciliation from gaap international revenues to international revenues included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as sbc but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our we define operating income as operating income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of sbc and as applicable other special items so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes sbc allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely sbc that are recurring sbc has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second sbc is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income and operating we define net income as net income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items less the related tax effects the tax effects of sbc and as applicable other special items are calculated using the portion of sbc and as applicable other special items and applying the federal and blended state tax rates we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with sbc and as applicable other special items without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with net income and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to cash we define international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter we consider international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management internal comparison to our historical international accompanying tables have more details on the

financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following financial measures operating income operating margin net income eps free cash flow and international revenues the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap for more information on these financial measures please see the tables captioned reconciliations of results of operations to the nearest comparable gaap measures reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and reconciliation from gaap international revenues to international revenues included at the end of this use these financial measures for financial and operational and as a means to evaluate comparisons our management believes that these financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding not only charges such as sbc but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these financial measures also facilitate management internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors operating results we believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our operating income and operating we define operating income as operating income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues google considers these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of sbc and as applicable other special items so that google management and investors can compare google recurring core business operating results over multiple periods because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use asc topic google management believes that providing a financial measure that excludes sbc allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between google recurring core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing google management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating google own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time there are a number of limitations related to the use of operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with gaap first operating income excludes some costs namely sbc that are recurring sbc has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in google business second sbc is an important part of our employees compensation and impacts their performance third the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from operating income and evaluating operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with operating income with define operating income with home as operating income plus sbc expense restructuring and related charges and the impact from home we consider this financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating net income and we define net income as net income plus expenses related to sbc and as applicable other special items less the related tax effects as well as net loss from discontinued operations the tax effects of sbc and as applicable other special items are calculated using the portion of sbc and as applicable other special items and applying the federal and blended state tax rates we define eps as net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares on a basis we consider these financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that google uses operating income and operating margin however in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results we exclude from net income and eps the tax effects associated with sbc and as applicable other special items without excluding these tax effects investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results the same limitations described above regarding google use of operating income and operating margin apply to our use of net income and eps management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from net income and eps and evaluating net income and eps together with net income and eps calculated in accordance with cash we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management comparisons of our operating results to competitors operating results a limitation of using free cash flow versus the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our quarterly report on form and annual report on form google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to international we define international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter we consider international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates managements internal
